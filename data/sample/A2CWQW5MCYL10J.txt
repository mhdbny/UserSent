The protagonist in G.M. Ford&#65533;s Seattle based &#65533;Black River&#65533; is Frank Corso, a hard boiled, paradoxical true crime writer. He has a strong sense of right and wrong in the Sam Spade manner.In &#65533;Black River&#65533; the government is trying for the third time to nail known criminal and pedophile Nicholas Belagula for bribery. Witnesses and inspectors keep turning up dead.After Corso connects seemingly unrelated events (murders) including one that strikes close to home---everything circumstantially points to Belagula.Corso unearths a paper trail that verifies the connection. Turning an insider is all that&#65533;s needed to convict Belagula.G.M. Ford, an excellent storyteller, gives you a nonstop, rapidly moving plot with well-developed characters. Once I got all the players clearly identified, it was impossible to put the book down.A couple of the bad guys are Elmore Leonardish, and the primary villains are absolutely loathsome.The appearance of the US Attorney General was a bit much and the ending too neat and tidy---but the ride to the conclusion was thrilling. Do not miss this one.

Les Standiford's "Havana Run" lives up to the high standards set the initial seven John Deal novels.Deal (the "last honest builder in South Florida") reluctantly accepts the promise of an extensive rebuilding project in post-Castro Cuba from the shady Antonio Fuentes. Fuentes represents a "consortium" and has a $1 million retainer.Prior to departing, Deal is coerced by a Justice Department op to plant miniature listening devices throughout the island.Once in Cuba, Deal sees he was lured there for a sinister purpose: to break an American prisoner out of a Castro jail...a man who holds secrets that many factions would kill to learn---others to keep them concealed.But who is pulling the strings: underground freedom fighters, the consortium, the US government, double agents, Castro partisans?From Miami to Key West to Cuba Deal discovers not everyone can be trusted and figuring out who is trustworthy is nearly impossible.Les Standiford is the most underrated Florida mystery writer. "Havana Run" is part crime fiction, part spy thriller...filled with intrigue, realistic action, suspense, betrayal and an ending that will knock you down.Top drawer reading!

Ed McBain serves up a couple of plot lines in "Fat Ollie's Book"---#52 in the 87th Precinct series.Ollie's completed novel is stolen from his vehicle while he catches the call on a murdered political activist.The outrageously outspoken Ollie tries to track down the book while joining up with all the regulars and irregulars from the 87th to solve the murder.The book thief thinks the manuscript is actually a police report that will lead him to a fortune. He provides the comedy of errors.It is a good big city police procedural. As expected, the crew from the 87th is in top form and the dialogue is crisp and provocative.Always entertaining, consistent activity and lots of the equal opportunity bigot Ollie Weeks---perhaps a bit too much humor and not enough drama---but still fun.

It was worth the four-year wait for Elvis Cole to return in "The Last Detective" by Robert Crais. I read it in less than 24 hours.The plot catapults at a relentless pace. Down-to-earth, practical detective work is what solves the crime in this ticking clock child kidnapping. Since the child is the son of Elvis Cole's girl friend, the hunt is both personal and professional&#65533;and therefore all the more chilling,The point of view switches between the characters (Elvis is in the first person) and is smooth as silk and most engaging.The reader learns the clues as they unfold for Elvis, going thru the stages of frustration to hope to possibility to solution with Elvis and his archangel Joe Pike.The supporting cast, especially Carol Starkey (from "Demolition Angel") is outstanding.We learn a lot of Elvis' past via flashbacks that propel the plot. The scene from his Vietnam days is as intense as any I have read.It is a compelling novel that truly showcases depth of Robert Crais as a writer.Highly recommended.

At eight years of age, Lucifer Dye could "shill a crap game, pimp for a whore house, speak six or seven languages, roll drunks, and hustle the rubes," but could neither read nor write.Dye is the central character in "The Fools in Town Are on Our Side" (1970) by Ross Thomas.It is a complex, unique, compulsively entertaining small town corruption novel.After Dye completes his education on a "scholarship" granted by a clandestine government agency he is employed by the agency, Section Two. And, he is told, "There is no Section One."After being unceremoniously dumped by the outfit, he is hired by Victor Orcutt to corrupt the corrupt in a Gulf Coast city.Myriad scalawags abound, chicanery is the order of the day and abundant deceptions are trump cards, as a cast of sharp, unforgettable characters are manipulated by Dye, Orcutt and two associates.There is never a dull moment in the absorbing narrative.The "heroes" are tarnished and shady, and not much better than their adversaries.The novels of Ross Thomas are fascinating and impossible to put down.Out of print for nearly a decade, several of his works are being reissued by St. Martin's Press. Do yourself a favor---pick one up and enjoy the ride.

It was at least four decades ago that I first read "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.I must confess it was a greater pleasure this time as an elective, rather than required reading.It is beautifully plotted and full of lyrical writing, intriguing dialogue and extremely rich and fully developed characters.The reader is magically transported into the Jazz Age by first person narrator Nick Carraway.The feature players Jay Gatsby, Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Jordan Baker are involved in a mystery comprising greed, ambition, and a love triangle.It truly is a novel whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Absolutely a classic.Reward yourself by reading or rereading "The Great Gatsby." It is time well spent.

I truly enjoy reading the books of J.A. Jance and this is another good one in the Sheriff Joanna Brady series. J.A. Jance's writing is clear and concise and the characters well drawn. The Arizona settings are wonderfully pictured and provide a great backdrop. The characters seem real and the pages fly by. This is a superb marriage of characters, action, sleuthing and comes to a satisfying conclusion.

"City of Bones" is intensely well written. For me it was a nonstop read that I could savor at the same time. I completed it in just two sittings.In this one Michael Connelly takes a couple of side roads that give the reader time to contemplate all that is surrounding Harry Bosch as he lives his "everyone counts or nobody counts" credo.As Harry seeks to uncover the murderer of a young boy that took place over twenty years earlier, a chain reaction of unintended consequences is set off---taking its toll in death and human destruction. The pages fly by as the reader joins Harry in his quest.Harry Bosch attacks this case with a vengeance that makes him an archangel for both the victim and Los Angeles.The writing is crisp, literate, hardboiled and dark---yet sensitive. It is complex story with a riveting plot. We continue to learn more about Harry Bosch as Mr. Connelly shows the reader some of Harry's more subtle characteristics.The ending is quite a surprise that had me talking to myself. Not to be missed is the interview that Michael Connelly does with Harry Bosch that is available on his web site. The interview gives away some plot points, so read "City of Bones" before the interview.This is mystery writing at its finest.

In "By the Light of the Moon", Dean Koontz violates Elmore Leonard's rule of writing #10---"Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip." There is a lot that can easily be skipped.Once you strip away the redundancies and verboseness, you will find a pretty suspenseful cat and mouse thriller. However, you must abandon 100% of your disbelief.The plot is at its most interesting when the focus is on the nanotechnology computers.Two of the three protagonists are almost interesting, but the autistic brother is truly tedious. The villains are evil and easy to dislike.For true Koontz fans only---and some of them may have a problem with this one.

John Grisham's "The King of Torts" is a fast paced pop novel.It is what one has come to expect from Mr. Grisham. A young, idealistic lawyer who is tempted and ultimately corrupted by untold riches...followed by a quick attempt at redemption.Clay Carter (the central character) is well developed, as are many of the supporting characters. A couple are somewhat cartoonish. Most are interesting, and a few are very important to moving the plot alongIt is somewhat of a morality tale a/o parable in part. The different paths Clay and the three associates who received the largesse that came with moving from the Public Defender's office to private practice is telling.As with many of his novels, the conclusion is less than fulfilling. However, it is a marvelous ride, and the journey trumps the destination; making for a most entertaining read.It is not deep and ponderous; it is simply good escapist enjoyment.

Hard not to like and enjoy a James Lee Burke book. This is really more of a short story full of action in the period of the Alamo. One can see the genesis of the future Burke works. Wonderfully descriptive phrases, fully drawn characters and the ever present feeling of danger. As a James Lee Burke fan I am glad it has been reissued...it's well worth taking the time to explore his origins...and it's got lots of action and thrills.

This was the last thing I expected from James Patterson. I now understand the &quot;soap opera&quot; references in the review section. It was almost like something Harold Robbins or Howard Fast would have written. If that's what I was looking for, I would chosen one of their books. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Patterson and the easy and speedy readability of the book I would have quit it at any number of places. I will look forward to his other books and hope this is just an anomaly. However I will say that at a mystery writers panel I attended it was James Patterson who said, &quot;if you want reality, go to K-Mart.&quot;

Michael McGarrity is a strong writer with a marvelous protagonist in Kevin Kerney.Set in New Mexico, the reader can experience the landscapes that Mr. McGarrity paints with a wonderful verbal brush.Kevin Kerney has grown, evolved and developed greatly as a central character as the series has progressed. That is not to say that any in the series is weak. Quite the contrary...it is a powerful series.It is realistic as the procedural part is most logical. It shows the grunt work necessary, the part luck plays and never to believe in coincidences in solving crimes.The plot is always in motion and this action is the focus of the book. The personal life of the primary characters weaves thru the narrative, but never gets in the way of the flow of the whodunit.Mr. McGarrity is high on my &quot;A&quot; list and I recommend this series highly. Start with &quot;Tularosa&quot; and I think you will be hooked.This is one writer I would really like to meet at a reading and signing.

This CD is loaded with style, substance and class. It manages to keep its place in the CD player while ther CD's come and go.K.T. has some great songs, and &quot;Live Close By&quot; is a superb lead off track. &quot;I Can't Remember Not Loving You&quot; and &quot;Somebody's Leavin' Somebody&quot; are my particular favorites of the new material.The trio of big band songs (&quot;Mean to Me&quot;, &quot;If You Were the Only Boy&quot; and Cole Porter's &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love&quot;) are given fresh life and blend in perfectly with the new tunes. They sound like they were written with K.T. in mind.This CD is a real treat, it's most refreshing, distinctive. K.T. is a unique talent. One can only hope that radio might awaken briefly enough to share this music with the public. What's not to like?

What a strong novel. It never loses its hold on the reader. It is extremely hard to put down even for sleep. Mr. Connelly is a master at keeping you turning the pages.The melding of Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb is both a treat and a wonderful juxtaposition of characters. Can they become friends or will there be enough doubts raised to make them adversaries?I strongly recommend going to www.michaelconnelly.com to get the short story that give you the back story and how Bosch and McCaleb first meet. It's very good insider knowledge.It is not easy to to give a precis of ADMTN without divulging too much. The book does a spectacular job of developing the characters of Bosch and McCaleb.My only regrets are that I read it so quickly and now I have another year to wait for the next one by Michael Connelly; and that I did not reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; and &quot;The Poet&quot; (as reporter Jack McEvoy joins the cast of ADMTN) before starting &quot;A Darkness More Than Night.&quot;As a solution I reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; after ADMTN and will do the same with &quot;The Poet&quot; shortly. Then I plan to reread the entire Harry Bosch series in order (one a month) and that should take me to next MC release.I have been fortunate enough to catch Mr. Connelly on three occasions at book signings. He is just as compelling speaking as he is in print. If he is making an appearance in your area, be certain to attend.

This one has been sitting on my shelf for years as I never picked up any buzz on it. After reading it, I wish he had more novels for me to discover.It has a great pace, and fits somewhat into the cat and mouse category. The search and chase for the info leads protagonist Adam Bruno across the country, back in time and in contact with a wide array of potential leads. It is easy to follow the logical pattern. The procedure is clearly delineated and makes sense.The characters were cleverly drawn and it was no problem to cheer for Adam Bruno. He showed street smarts, resourcefulness and imagination; tinged with just enough sarcasm directed at his smug adversarial employer.I did not find it excessively gory or profane. People who have been thru what many of &quot;The Codicil&quot;'s characters experienced do express themselves in this fashion. I found it realistic and not overdone.It is truly a page turner that took less than a weekend to read. Great stuff!!!

G.M. Ford's third Frank Corso novel, "A Blind Eye" is an intense, dark, fast paced mystery thriller.Two Texas marshals have a material witness warrant that Corso (a true crime writer) is eager to avoid.On the lam with his amazonish photojournalist, Meg Dougherty---a blinding snowstorm drives them to an abandoned Wisconsin farmhouse for shelter. Buried in shed, they discover the skeletons of the Holmes family---murdered fifteen years ago.The small town sheriff makes a deal with Corso. He investigates this coldest of cases---she misleads the Texas marshals.The harrowing search for the family serial killer leads to Pennsylvania, the Ramapo Mountains of New Jersey and Michigan.The journey to uncover the elusive and shadowy criminals is fascinating and filled with brilliant surprises.The supporting cast---an isolated, inbred group known as the White Jacksons, the Texas marshals, the sheriff and the surprisingly cooperative New Jersey FBI SAIC---is strong and inventive.The wisecracking Corso is positively enigmatic, with his own sense of honor---always striving to unearth the truth, no matter the roadblocks.The ending is absolutely chilling.A willing suspension of disbelief is the perfect supplement to Mr. Ford's agile plot and tough situation resolutions.

It has been fortysome years since I read CITR in my high school English class. It was a great read this time as well.In fact, I probably enjoyed more as an adult...perhaps a case of arrested development. In any event, I had many laughs, a few revelations and joy.Strong narration and oh so true to any of us who attended boarding school in the 1950's.From now on Catcher In The Rye will be visited yearly. I should never have stayed away so long. I deprived myself of much reading fun.Holden Caufield is still my role model.

Robert Parker continues to keep Spenser fresh, energetic and fun to read.Thirtysome novels into the series, "Back Story" finds Spenser and Hawk looking into a twenty-eight year old murder for a friend of a friend---the victim's daughter.As they attempt to connect whatever dots they can assemble, the first missing link is the FBI report on the case. Next thing you know, "government men" try to persuade Spenser to take a powder. Hmmm???Shortly thereafter some not-so-friendly mobster types pass a similar message Spenser's way.These "suggestions" merely strengthen Spenser's resolve and makes him dig deeper. Current members of the Boston PD and the FBI's Boston office are more than interested and do not inhibit the intrepid Spenser.The usual crisp repartee between Spenser and Hawk, lively dialogue, a colorful supporting cast and a cameo appearance by Jesse Stone highlight the story.Another highly entertaining, most enjoyable weekend diversion.

And, it turns out to be both full and meaningful.A book like this could become sickenly sweet and gag you----however Mitch Albom makes it passionate, touching, heartfelt and profound.

P.J. Parrish&#65533;s &#65533;Thicker Than Water&#65533; is the fourth Louis Kincaid and second set on Florida&#65533;s West Coast. It is terrific.Louis Kincaid is a refreshing protagonist with a deep sense of honor, principal and integrity who looks for those traits in others.Since the legal system may not always get it right, sometimes Louis Kincaid nudges justice a bit just to make certain.Upon release after serving a twenty-year rape sentence, Jack Cade is accused of a murder that occurs shortly after his return.Cade is a vile man, but Louis Kincaid picks him up as a client. It appears the two crimes are related---but Cade may have been set up for both of them.Suspects abound---with twists that seem to absolve everyone you suspectAs the odds against Louis Kincaid&#65533;s quest mount he shows more determination in seeking the truth.Wonderful pacing holds you to the final chapter before you realize whodunit.Louis Kincaid continues to grow as a character, the supporting cast is robust and the Florida setting is appropriately steamy.

Michael Connelly's "The Lincoln Lawyer" has rekindled my interest in the legal thriller. He may or may not have reinvented the legal thriller...but he certainly has refreshed it to an amazing degree and sets a new standard for the genre.The Lincoln lawyer of the title is Mickey Haller...so named because his office is his Lincoln Towncar tricked out with fax, phone, internet, folding desk and files. Chauffeured by a former client working off his fee, Mickey does business while commuting between the numerous court houses in Los Angeles.On the surface Mickey appears to be the stereotypical sleazy defense attorney. His two ex-wives and young daughter are still fond of him (wife number two is his case manager)...he does his share of pro bono work...and is fiercely honorable in his own way. So beneath the surface of the lawyer with bus bench advertising, whose clientele are hookers, drug dealers, scam artists and assorted LA lowlifes is a flawed and complex character.This practice provides a decent living (he has a home "with a million dollar view and a million one mortgage"), but not what the esteemed law firm pull down.His chance at the brass ring (the franchise client) turns up when a rich Beverly Hills real estate broker is pinched for attempted rape and murder. Mickey feels this may be an unusual client for him---an accused who is actually innocent. The fee is huge and the checks do not bounce.Naturally the case swerves in different directions and Mickey is compelled to reevaluate the veracity of his profession and the viable aspects of the law itself."The Lincoln Lawyer" has plenty of deduction and suspense, compelling ethical dilemmas, characters with depth and texture and razor sharp dialogue.Mr. Connelly draws precise portraits of the individuals and their motivations. Mickey's audacious scheme drives a slide rule perfect plot that leads to a turbulent climactic encounter followed by a stupefying revelation."The Lincoln Lawyer" proves that crime novels can be art. It deserves the careful reading its plot demands.

This chase takes place in California, Hong Kong and China. While in California I found it quite a good ride.As soon as it left these shores and went to Hong Kong and China it grounded to nearly a halt for me. It got very heavy on travelogue and way too much on the poilitics of the region. These boring passages only accentuated the preposterous situations the protagonist got in and out of.I did like Neal Carey and some of his support team. Mr. Winslow's writing style was fine and I will try another Neal Carey, but will make certain it takes place in the USA.This could be an enjoyable series and lead character, but the setting for this book just bored me beyond words. If you care about China and its politics it's probably a big winner.

I do not think that Stuart Woods has ever disappointed me. &quot;Grassroots&quot; is intricately plotted with absorbing parallel stories that work their way to the same bad guys. Mr. Woods writes in a way that makes the pages fly by. It's easy to pull for the good guys and it is impossible to work up any sympathy for the villains. The protagonist (Senatorial candidate Will Lee) is scheduled to reappear in Mr. Woods' next novel (&quot;The Run&quot;). After reading &quot;Grassroots&quot; I shall be first in line when &quot;The Run&quot; hits the stores sometime in May. Mr. Woods has a most entertaining series currently going with bon vivant lawyer Stone Barrington that I find to be great fun.

Suspend your disbelief and get ready for a most intense ride.It's got so much going for it. A fabulous plot that mixes a kid wrongly accused on the run, a police manhunt, a savvy contract killer on the loose, a politically motivated DA, a cop who beleives the kid (Nathan) just might be a victim and not a murderer.Add a top rated DC talk show host to give the country the play by play and you have a book impossible to put down. I knocked it off in two sittings. It was nonstop action and I felt exhausted when all was resolved.If I am not mistaken this is John Gilstrap's initial novel. I will be tracking down his later works.

Diana Krall's "From This Moment On" salutes the timeless standards.From the Gershwins to Johnny Mercer---Jobim to Irving Berlin---Cole Porter to Rodgers and Hart, the selections in this collection are flawless.She makes the songs her own with her stylish simplicity, sophistication, elegance and grace.Ms. Krall's &eacute;lan and confidence give the songs a freshness that makes you feel that you are hearing them for the first time.In fact, "From This Moment On" by Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer's "Day In, Day Out" and "Exactly Like You" by McHugh and Fields sound like they were written especially for her.Never did I think anyone could co-own (or even sublet) "Come Dance With Me" from Frank Sinatra, but Diana Krall does something extra-special with it.A compilation of "whoop dee doo" songs performed in a polished and refined manner.It is quite possible that Diana Krall is the Ella Fitzgerald of our day.

Michael McGarrity's "Everyone Dies" is an outstanding, intricately plotted police procedural. With his experience at various law enforcement agencies, Mr. McGarrity writes with a most authoritative voice. There is a lot of credibility between the covers.Mr. McGarrity peoples the novel with a host of characters in support of Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney. The important and continuing ones are fully developed---you truly get to know and care about them.Ultimately this sophisticated tale is one of revenge. A diabolically clever villain from Chief Kerney's past is out to kill Kerney---but not before eliminating those Kerney holds dear. Kerney's wife and unborn son are among the targets.A massive manhunt with all New Mexico law enforcement organizations involved is mounted. Kerney's reputation for decency, fairness and integrity prevents the usual inter-agency turf battles.You feel the frustration, disappointment and stimulation brought on by the day-to-day info gathering, false leads and cold trails the cops encounter---and the elation felt as the pieces of the puzzle come together.In a wonderful twist, the inventive and resourceful villain shrewdly sets up an unwitting loner to take the fall. It is a brilliant cover up, foiled only by the patsy's own extra-legal activities. One of the best reversals I have experienced.New Mexico is an important character in all the Kerney novels. Mr. McGarrity puts you inside the investigation and the Land of Enchantment.An under appreciated author and series. All eight in the Kevin Kerney series are keepers. Do not hesitate to follow this series.

This one started off a bit slowly. The pace picked up, but it is a deliberate pace throughout.The jacket had comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, but I did not really see that. Hiaasen's recent works have been peopled by characters that have become cartoonish and parodies. The characters in &quot;Deadly Sweet&quot; are far more plausable.The main players are believeable and the plot makes sense. The comic element that Hiaasen brings is not present here, and to me that was a major plus.It never becomes a fast read or a &quot;page turner&quot; in the strict sense. It progresses at a logical pace and the loose ends are tied up. The protagonists are easy to cheer for and it's easy to feel their losses along the way.I enjoyed it. However, I felt the Hiaasen comparisons were off base, but that was a positive. Maybe reviewers think any novel set in Florida is Hiaasenesque.

"Last Train to Paradise" is a nonfiction account of the construction of the railroad connecting Key West to the Florida mainland, a project headed by Henry Flagler.It is a well-researched and documented history of an exciting time in the exploration and development of Florida that reads like a novel.Building a railroad over 150 miles of water under the harshest of conditions was the vision of one man, Henry Flagler. Mr. Flagler used his personal fortune to make this dream come true.When he first arrived in Florida he was the second wealthiest man in the country. His fortune was made in partnership with John Rockefeller and the creation of Standard Oil.The ingenuity necessary to accomplish this task is absolutely incredible. The obstacles overcome included the brutal weather (heat and hurricanes), having to import every item from drinking water to food to nails.As I read the story I found the task more impossible with each accomplishment along the way. The closer they got to their objective, the more unattainable I thought the goal was. They truly did the impossible.That Mr. Flagler and his crew succeeded is a testament to the pioneer spirit of America.Dr. Standiford has written a fast paced book. He is a wonderful story teller. It is where truth and fact is so improbable, that one could not make up a superior fictional account.The photographs are a wonderful addition.With all the scandals in business today, it is enlightening to read the story of a man who put his reputation and own money on the line for what he believed in.As Dr. Standiford said: "Henry Flagler evolved from acquisitive robber baron to creator."Henry Flagler may not have discovered Florida, but he saw all the state's possibilities and created the framework and infrastructure that made Florida livable.

Major Sean Drummond is a nonconformist, cynical and self-deprecating JAG lawyer...a wonderful character with wit, charm, smarts.Before JAG, he was a member of super secret covert "outfit" in the US intelligence community.In Brian Haig's "Secret Sanction" Drummond is assigned to what appears to be a straightforward case. Someone has committed a massacre of 35 Serbian troops who were led by a brutal, sadistic warlord.The army brass fears this will get attention on a par with Vietnam's My Lai massacre.Once in Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what appears to be a giant cover-up/conspiracy greets Drummond and his legal team.NSA, CIA, Green Berets, Drummond's mentor (two star general Clapper) and on up to the Commander-in-Chief are possible members of the whitewash.The pace is fast, the dialogue electric, the characters real and fully fleshed out. It is muscular legal thriller...perhaps John Grisham in army fatigues.Each clue unearthed leads to another seeming dead end...but Drummond is relentless in finding out what really took place.The journey to the d&eacute;nouement is a breathtaking voyage and the ending will take you by surprise.A winner on many levels!

If you completely suspend your disbelief before you read &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; you'll have a most enjoyable read. Many of the situations are preposterous and are impossible to see happening. But those are merely elements in fiction...and this is truly fiction.I understand the review that called this a great beach read. What a perfect description. The pages fly by as the protagonist and his associates get into one impossible situation after another. Trust starts to dissolve among the tight ban of friends as they try to trap the villain. This internal drama is just as dicey as the good versus bad battle, as the friends suspect there is a traitor amongst them.Some interesting characters in the D.C. setting. This is nothing short of a fun read. If you go in treating this a &quot;lite read&quot; you'll have big fun, and it will not take much time.Enjoy...

In his strong debut legal thriller "The Color of Law," Mark Gimenez keeps a tempo going that makes it impossible to put down.A. Scott Feeney was football hero at SMU, married the head cheerleader, owns a home in the tony Dallas suburb of Highland Park and is the youngest partner in the most prominent law firm in "Big D." In short, he has the perfect life.After giving an especially disingenuous speech about legal idealism he is assigned a pro bono case by a Federal Judge. He must defend a black prostitute hooked on heroin who is accused of murdering the debauched son of very wealthy Texas Senator---who is the Presidential frontrunner for his party.A. Scott assumes she is guilty. However, if he exposes the son's sleazy past, he may save her from the death penalty. This does not please the Senator.After the powerful Senator calls in favors all over Dallas, A. Scott has his mortgage called, his Ferrari repossessed, the country club membership gone, fired by his largest client and his firm...the perfect life evaporated.He rediscovers his conscience and decides to give his best effort.We know he will prevail, but the how keeps you reading into the wee hours.I was so engrossed in his story telling that it was only near the end of the book that I started to wonder who really committed the murder.

"Primal Fear" by William Diehl is just as riveting and absorbing on the second read as it was on the fist go around.Knowledge of the astonishing conclusion enhanced rather than diminished my satisfaction, as I read with a different perspective.It was intriguing to know just who the manipulators were and appreciate their diabolical natures.Mr. Diehl is a marvelous writer and impressive storyteller. He illuminates the main characters skillfully. You feel you are on a first name basis with them as he introduces their back-story in an almost conversational manner.The DA's team, defense attorney Martin Vail's contingent, as well as the victim and suspect are positively vivid characters.The pacing is taut and the denouement is electrifying."Primal Fear" was a favorite of mine when first published and remains so today. It holds up.As good a legal thriller as I have read.

Lee Child's seventh Jack Reacher novel "Persuader" is an intense story of revenge and intrigue told in the first person.Former MP Reacher is the ultimate lonewolf...a taciturn, resourceful, powerful presence.In "Persuader" he teams up with an "off the books" DEA undercover operation.The sting to get Reacher inside the target's base that opens the book is explosive and sets the pace for a high velocity, breakneck plot.Busting a drug import business is the DEA's goal (it turns out that it is far more destructive than drugs); Reacher's is to put an end to someone he thought killed ten years earlier. We learn his motive via an insightful backstory.Hunter and prey stalk one another in this suspenseful, deftly plotted compressed time period window.As usual, Lee Child makes the most of a limited cast by making all characters three dimensional, including the ruthless villains.Reacher's credo is "Never forgive, never forget." Lee Child makes Reacher impossible to forget.

The third time is the charm. Afer finishing the third Jack Reacher novel, Lee Child has moved into my &quot;can't wait for the paperback/get the hardcover upon release&quot; category. For me he joins: Michael Connelly, Stephen Hunter, Nelson DeMille, James W. Hall, Stuart Woods, William Diehl, Clive Cussler and Robert Crais.&quot;Tripwire&quot; contains all the best aspects of thriller, suspense and the cat and mouse. Reacher is a strong presence as the resourceful protagonist. Part of his past is presented in the back story as he follows up on a case initially undertaken by his recently deceased mentor. A love interest enters his life in the person of his mentor's daughter. Reacher's current life is getting more complete and he is growing as a character.The chase for information to solve the mystery of a Vietnam chopper crash is well thought out and proceeds at a good pace.The villains are perfectly loathsome, but clever and daring...they are worthy adversaries. Reacher uses his MP background, military contacts and knowledge of how the army works to get the answers as he searches for the villains.Great surprise twist at the end that I did not predict. A page turner of the first order.

The arrival of a new Archy McNally is always a welcome event.While "McNally's Alibi" is the easily the most densely plotted of the eleven in the series, it still retains its "mystery-lite" quality and is great fun.It is a tongue-in-cheeky romp amongst the rich and infamous in Palm Beach.Highway Patrol Lt. Georgia O'Hara is introduced and is a character I hope will stay in the series. She is a much better paramour for Archy then the tedious Connie Garcia.Double dealing, double crossing, a sting operation as well as a counter sting revolve around the whereabouts of the original manuscript of a Truman Capote novel that an ardent rich collector desires.Archy and his excellent supporting cast sort out the truth and lies and save the day.A good time to be had for the reader.

A most enjoyable ride thru the old west told in nine short stories.Mr. L'Amour puts you right in the scene. You can almost feel the heat of the desert sun, taste the blowing alkali dust, see the Indians on the horizon and touch the hand tooled leather saddles.He places you right in the middle of the action and the word paintings of the Southwest are magnificent. He brings the sunsets to life and allows the reader to visualize the stark beauty of the Arizona/New Mexico deserts.The characters, both good and bad guys, are well sculpted and realistic. They epitomize the hard life that country bred and are easy to admire.Along with Larry McMurtry, Louis L'Amour makes the western a gourmet read.

I am a big fan of Laurence Shames and his Key West capers with many a colorful character. The high dose of humor his stories usually contain is a huge selling point. Like Woody Allen, I enjoy Laurence Shames when he's funny.There is scant humor in &quot;The Naked Detective&quot;, so it ranks low on my personal likeability meter. However, it is a strong noirish short novel. As usual the Key West descriptions are so vivid you can taste the salty air, get burned by the sun and feel the dampness of the humidity. The scenes are brilliantly set. The action is a bit uneven; nonstop at times, followed by lulls.The whodunit is a clever twist and the &quot;Maltese Falcon like&quot; buried treasure's identity is kept from the reader until the end. Neither is easily telegraphed, so you have plenty of time to play guessing games and solve the mystery.

Clive Cussler starts a new series featuring mercenary leader Juan Cabrillo in "Golden Buddha." Cabrillo sails the high seas with his group of legionnaires doing jobs for governments, corporations and anyone willing to pay his price. They travel in a state of the art ship disguised as a derelict tramp cargo ship.A terrific premise and promise from one of my favorite writers.However, it is peopled with one-dimensional characters, filled with cliches, trite dialogue and stereotypes.They routinely perform the totally impossible with zero casualties. Just too preposterous---well beyond the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief.Like James Patterson, it appears Mr. Cussler is doing less and less of the actual writing---and phoning in his part.Where is Dirk Pitt when you really need him?

Thus far the best book of the year 2000 for me. There was no putting it down. It was a riveting, nonstop read from page one.John Corey is a wonderful protagonist, and Mr. DeMille allows him a lot of humor and political incorrectness as well as his hard nosed dedication to getting the job done right. John Corey's inner thoughts (those he does not say aloud) brought many a laugh as Mr. Corey tried to behave in the most polically correct way in the interest of inter-agency cooperation.The culture clash between the FBI and CIA ops and John Corey are well played. At times one wonders if the agency types are not interfering with the real mission...but John Corey prevails.Mr. DeMille is one of my favorite writers. &quot;The Lion's Game&quot; joins &quot;The Charm School&quot;, &quot;Word of Honer&quot; and &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; as my favorites. Only &quot;Cathedral&quot; disappointed me.Tightly packed and tension filled with a wonderful dash of wry humor fill this speedy page turner.KVD

A bunch of people whose tastes I trust have highly recommended Vince Flynn's &quot;Transfer of Power&quot;, so I decide to start with his first novel and I was not disappointed.This one moves full speed ahead from page one. The technical aspects seem correct and the DC/Maryland landscape is well mapped and researched. So, the activity flows nicely and you can believe the action.The premise to the plot is where the imagination is needed; but if you have even the tiniest belief in any conspiracy theory involving the U.S. government, then it is easy to buy into the basis of Mr. Flynn's ideas.A couple of FBI and CIA types are bona fide decent, but the rest of the &quot;good guys&quot; have decided the ends justify the means, and have taken the means to their own extremes. The villains are far worse, and totally repulsive.If I had one complaint I would say it's about one hundred pages too long. It was overkill on the final three or four &quot;situations&quot; after the evil doers were uncovered. From what I have heard and the reviews I have seen in Amazon.com, it is apparent Mr. Flynn left a lot for his second novel. I look forward to &quot;Transfer of Power&quot; and hope it's a little more compact.

While Baltimore Sun's columnist Michael Olesker (a native) is too liberal for my sensibilities, his "Baltimore, "If You Live Here, You're Home" is a wonder read.A collection of his columns between 1979 and 1995; it's a respectful and loving paean to the city of Baltimore.The heroes, characters, politicos, sports figures, neighborhoods, crime and missing friends are featured subjects.It resonates for all who enjoy, love, live or work in Baltimore.Well done.

John Grisham is pretty much the king of pop-fiction/pop-thriller novels.&quot;The Summons&quot; moves at warp speed thru the first 330 pages, and the reader is primed for an intense resolution. For me, the ending was a most unsatisfactory conclusion. It was as if Mr. Grisham either got tired or bored and just ended it. I have had that feeling with a couple of his titles.Still, those initial 330 pages are well worth the price of admission. The ride is better than the destination---and that certainly is not a bad thing---and it is quite a ride.Characters that I found most interesting kept appearing. One more intriguing the the next.His red herrings continued to trick me, as I kept changing my deduction on who the villain was.This is a fast read and would be a most pleasant way to spend a weekend. Reading John Grisham is like eating peanuts---you cannot put the book down until all the pages disappear.

"Swing" by Rupert Holmes is an absolute treat. It keeps you guessing from start to finish.Mr. Holmes has won a pair of Edgars, a Grammy, three Tony Awards and his previous novel ("Where the Truth Lies") is being made into a film starring Kevin Bacon. Mr. Holmes is no Forest Gump."Swing" is not a formulaic mystery...though a death transpires early on. It is a brainy, atmospheric, literate, nimble novel.Set in 1940 during the Golden Gate International Exposition on the manmade Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, the noirish fictional historic thriller is narrated by sax player and arranger Ray Sherwood. He is part of the Jack Donovan Orchestra of Note...playing an extended gig at the upscale Claremont Hotel in Oakland.Upon arrival, Berkeley student Gail Prentice entices Ray into helping her score her prize winning piano piece for full orchestra. Part of the prize is a performance by Japan's Pan Pacific Orchestra.Ray agrees and enters into a world of betrayal, deceit, double crosses, murder and political intrigue.Nazi sympathizers, a former lover from twenty years past, Sally Rand's Nude Ranch, Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon, the Lindy Hop, Japanese diplomats, lime phosphates are just a few of the people, places and lingo that transport the reader solidly into the big band era and lifestyle. An era when what musicians loved to play was what the public loved to hear.The book comes with a CD of original big band music composed by Mr. Holmes. Clues are contained in the music...I, myself, was far too obtuse to locate said clues. However the CD has dominated my player for the past 300 miles.No matter...the story is about something more ominous and disturbing than a murder, but to tell more would diminish the pleasure of the denouement."Swing" is right on key and not to be missed.

I enjoyed P.J. Tracy's stylishly written debut novel, "Monkeewrench."It is peopled with vividly drawn intelligent characters and presented from multiple POV's. The three story lines converge for a nice payoff with the loose ends tied up.The high concept premise (murders replicate a yet to be released violent video game) centers around two parallel investigations.The unpredictable plot accelerates at a good pace.Everyone at Monkeewrench (game's creator) seems to have a secret. All five partners are filled with idiosyncrasies---they all have permits to carry and an innate distrust of the law. At one time or another any of them could be suspected as the serial killer.The dialogue is realistic and peppered with wry and dry humor. The mix of computer geeks, small town cops and big city (Minneapolis) law enforcement works.Glad to learn this is the start of a four book series, as I want to know more about this cast of characters.

Frank Deford is a most articulate, persuasive, engaging writer---perhaps the finest sports journalist writing today.The collection of articles and commentaries contained in "I'm Just Getting Started" are from 1980 to 1999 and touch on every aspect of sports.You get insight, irony, humor, commentary, entertainment, nostalgia and optimism as you turn the pages---all delivered in a most literate manner.The essay on Bill Russell alone is worth the price of admission. "Frank Deford Goes Bowling" is an intriguing take on a subject seldom written up in sports pages.Enjoyable for more than sports fans.

An historical novel from Scott Turow, a master of the legal thriller? Yes, and "Ordinary Heroes" is remarkable reading.It is a thoughtful look at JAG and the military justice system.The story-within-a-story structure shows the intersection of three people and provides the foundation for the excellent novel.Stewart Dubinsky is arranging the funeral for his father (David Dubin) when he uncovers a pack of letters dating from World War II. He learns of a former fianc&eacute;e, a court-martial, a brief imprisonment. Stewart wonders who his father really was and why he never spoke of his war service.His quest leads him to his father's former defense lawyer and keeper of a novel-length series of accounts David wrote of the events leading to his court-martial. That document sends Stewart on his mission to unearth his father's true past.During World War II around the time of The Battle of the Bulge, Dubin is assigned to locate and arrest the charming, daring, rouge OSS officer Robert Martin. Martin is accompanied by Gita Lodz, an extraordinarily gallant Polish resistance fighter.The story of those three shows the agonizing moral conflicts and dilemmas inherent in war...the relentless casual horror...the disappearance of decency.The further he is from JAG headquarters and the more of war David participates in and observes (especially the actions of Martin), the more he questions the veracity of his orders.In combat David learns more about who he is and it leads him in paths he never thought he could choose.To give away more plots would spoil your read.As an emotional accomplice, you almost feel guilty when, in the end, you put down this amazing story and resume your life.

Fear, obsession, paranoia...Dennis Lehane's "Shutter Island" is the stuff nightmares are made of. It is noir psychological suspense at its finest.An isolated island, a raging hurricane, a locked room, secret codes, a mental hospital, rumors of mysterious medical experiments frame the story.It is a scary, deceptive, disorienting, complex story grounded in the reality of the times...cold war USA in 1954 ("I like Ike").Mr. Lehane weaves many threads throughout the unpredictable plot. The set up is thorough and the characters are fully developed. The twists and turns play havoc with your mind.The unexpected is the norm...a couple of times I was able to figure something out a page and a half before it was revealed, but that was rare. The ending is unguessable.Immediately upon finishing, I reread the prolog and final chapter...and will read this book again. I have not been so dumbfounded by an ending since William Diehl's "Primal Fear.""Shutter Island" is etched in my memory.

"Pacific Beat" by T. Jefferson Parker is a strong book that I thought a bit too long. He is one of the most descriptive writers (Sample passages: "The silver limousine appeared in the fog as if born from it." "They say we have our memories, thought Jim, but really our memories have us.") and sometimes gets carried away---slowing down the plot movement.Excellent suspense and a terrific overall plot---with fully fleshed out characters.As usual, Orange County is a major character. This time it appears someone is dumping chemicals in the harbor. This could ruin property values and allow developers an [inexpensive] price, permitting them to raze everything and create some pricey real estate.Uncovering a murderer seems to be a major key to locating the illegal waste disposers. I dismissed the murderer as a suspect early on and fell for most of the false leads.It is a good book that would be great if shorter and more to the point. It's not a page-turner.T. Jeff is a wonderful writer and storyteller.

At the start of this one I wondered how he could fill the 460 pages with enough plot twists to keep me interested. It did not take long to get hooked with this different take on &quot;reluctant hero overcomes impossible perils&quot;. The pages flew by at at least 100 per sitting. Mr DeMille is a master at keeping you glued to his books and &quot;Mayday&quot; is great entertainment. It takes a minimum willing suspension of disbelief to get totally involved and root for the good guys. The bad guys are well drawn and it is easy to find them dispicable. Fun read.

My New Year's resolution was to submit reviews only to books I could give a 4 or 5 to---in order to spread the word on reading treats.However, this book needs a warning label.Plodding, boring, tedious, just a chore to read.Had I not been stuck in a doctor's waiting room for nearly an hour and a half I would have chucked this one and moved on to another book.The book lacks the usual intiguing plotting Mr. Higgins is known for. Also missing is the normally ferocious pace that makes you almost break your arm turning pages in his novels.Life is too short for a bad book. Avoid this one. His repertoire is crammed with exciting reads---try one of those.

In "The Forgotten Man", Robert Crais weaves an exceptionally intricate plot and unravels it in a most satisfying and logical manner.The police procedural aspect is realistic and intriguing.We also learn a bit more of the back story on lead character, Elvis Cole ("world's greatest detective").A murder victim's dying words are that he is the father Elvis never knew.This revelation starts Elvis tracing the man's history in a quest to learn the truth. He and the LAPD investigators cooperate and share information...a rare show of collaboration.Crimes from the past show up as one generation casts a shadow over the next.The twists and turns are genuinely well crafted...I was taken in often as the case evolved. Magnificent plotting!Los Angeles is a major character and Mr. Crais is a master at getting the city's culture, lifestyle and state of mind to seep into the reader's consciousness without drenching the reader and overdoing it.This is an outstanding addition to the Elvis Cole anthology. Not to be missed.

This book doesn't even take time to warm up...it is white hot from page one. I started on a Saturday and finished the next evening.&quot;Hostage&quot; ensnares you as a reader...and you cannot stop reading. Neither can you stop guessing who is part of the double and triple crosses that stalk the protagonist( Jeff Talley).It's one crisis after another...each brought to conclusion in a believable fashion. Quick time decision making, who to trust, who to doubt, when to go against the book, when to take the daring chance...carry the experienced former LA SWAT leader thru an intense twenty-four hours.The villains are particularly unlikable...and you know that there are a lot like them out there. These miscreants are very real. Mr. Crais fully develops them, and they are to be feared.Talley gets help from a least likely ally...one of the hostages, a ten year old boy (Thomas) who rises to the occasion. Thomas shows the boundaries one can push in a life and death situation.I cannot say if this is Mr. Crais' finest effort or not. His writing is that good. I have gotten so much pleasure from his body of work, and was thrilled to have a new one by him. I do think it is as good as anything I have read this year. I rank &quot;Hostage&quot; up there with Michael Connelly's &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot;, Harlan Coben's &quot;Tell No One&quot; and Dennis Lehane's &quot;Mystic River&quot; from this year's releases thus far.This could be a great movie, but don't know if I see Bruce Willis as Jeff Talley. It could just as easily be a case where the book is far better than the movie.In either case I am glad I read the book. I will read it again.

Michael McGarrity's "The Big Gamble" is a fascinating and believable police procedural vividly set in New Mexico.Two bodies (seemingly unrelated) are discovered after a fire of dubious origin. One is an eleven-year-old cold case from Kevin Kerney's past. His estranged son is the primary for the other victim.The plot follows the pair of investigations that eventually uncover a huge ring of gambling, prostitution, drugs, money laundering and politicians. The villains are high-ranking politicos, plus one evil gunsel.A credible resolution that opens the possibility for continued pairing of Kerney and his son.This seventh book in the Kevin Kerney series is just as fresh as the first---one reason being that Kerney has held various positions in New Mexico law enforcement in different locales.Great series by a most under discovered writer.

&quot;Eureka,&quot; William Diehl's first novel in five years is absolutely spectacular.It sets the curve for me so far this year. I cannot remember a read this good in a long long time.It took a great deal of self-discipline not to reread it immediately after finishing it. I was torn between reading it as fast as possible to see how everything was resolved or limiting myself to a daily ration in order to savor it for an extended period.Could not put it down and had to reread the last chapter at once.The characters come alive and you feel a part of the story. I was drawn into the era as the settings seemed atmospherically perfect. The plot is intoxicating, and just when you think you have solved a part of it; you find you guessed incorrectly.It is a wonderfully noirish, hard boiled tale. I felt the spirit of Raymond Chandler and hopes this becomes a movie. Mr. Diehl just gets better and better.It was worth the five-year wait.

Robert B. Parker's third Sunny Randall novel is witty, bright, light and full of crisp dialog. A fast-paced plot that makes for a swift read.The plot pitches the reader to the climax thru a succession of increasing danger points that P.I. Sunny Randall, her client, her archangel Spike and ex-husband overcome.The villain is a twisted, creepy psychologist who is stalking and manipulating his former wife (Sunny's client, best selling author Melanie Joan Hall.) Seems he has a history of terrorizing and manipulating his female patients.Mr. Parker does a nifty job of developing the characters by exploring their relationships mainly via dialog with a minimum of narrative passages.Big fun.

An early effort (1979) by Dean Koontz, updated and more contemporary. It is in the suspense/thriller/cat and mouse category, rather than the more supernatural, atmospheric novels he is known for.It reads well, the pages fly by, the pace is always building and the flow logical. It is a book with strong momentum. You won't get bored.Strong characters, good action and a satisfying resolution.It gives one a glimpse at DK at an early stage, and is worth reading for that alone. More importantly, it works. I feel he does this genre quite well and wish he would give us a couple more like this and &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart.&quot;&quot;The Watchers&quot; is still my favorite DK.

Stephen J. Cannell's third Shane Scully novel, "Hollywood Tough" is as implausible as was his "A Team" with protagonists more resilient than his Jim Rockford. Be that as it may, if you suspend disbelief, it is big fun.The cop lingo, street jargon and snappy dialogue alone are worth the price of admission.Noteworthy scene setting and character descriptions ("'Champagne' Tony Valentine was managing to stay just inside the boundaries of fashion comedy.") abound.Mr. Cannell knows Hollywood and uses his insider knowledge to paint amusing and self-effacing portraits of the movie biz and its oh-so-Hollywood-execs.Either of the two major plots could carry a novel on its own. That makes for some clumsiness, confusion and too many handily convenient coincidences to move the plot forward...at times convoluted, but always entertaining.Titling each chapter in a wry, tongue-in-cheek fashion is a nifty touch.

"Echo Park," the latest Harry Bosch novel from Michael Connelly is quite spectacular.LAPD Detective Bosch is now working cold cases as a member of the Open-Unsolved Unit with his partner Kiz Rider.In 1993, Bosch worked the Marie Gesto case, where she walked out of a supermarket and disappeared. Her car and cloths were found, but the body never turned up.Bosch never let go of the case in the thirteen intervening years.A captured serial killer strikes a deal with the DA. To avoid the death penalty he will own up to several other killings---including Marie Gesto.Now Bosch must make certain the killer (Raynard Waits) is not conning the DA. Waits's name never came up in Bosch's original investigation---in fact, Bosch had a suspect that he still believes could have done it.Even after Waits leads the DA's team to the buried body, Bosch is still skeptical.The well-executed plot is so first-rate and too intricate to reveal any more.As thought provoking and unsettling as the plot is, it is the well-formed characters with multifaceted personas that are driving forces of the novel.Mr. Connelly makes the characters authentic...you feel a bona fide attachment to them. He makes you invest in them and truly care for them.There is a section devoted to the "field trip" to uncover Marie Gesto's body that is as powerful, emotional and riveting as anything I have ever read. When the "field trip" concluded, I was exhausted...but could not stop reading.The police procedural aspect is interwoven with LA politics creating an added layer of tension.Michael Connelly is the master of hiding the telling clues in plain sight. His style deftly entrances you. At the d&eacute;nouement you have the wonderful "oh wow" moment.As usual, the Connelly novel is one to read more than once.

Mid-afternoon yesterday UPS brought me my latest Amazon order.On top was Dr. Hall's "Hot Damn!"I devoured it in two sessions.These thirty-nine essays are insightful, poignant, thoughtful, humorous, heartfelt and a joy to read.The compositions are such a delight that I will now go back and savor a couple of them daily. Each one is most relatable on a multitude of levels.You do not have to be Floridian to enjoy these essays---but if you are, many strike a most responsive chord.Seldom do I stray from the mystery/thriller genre, but like "Seabiscuit," "Hot Damn!" reads like a novel."The Hardy Boys" chapter alone is worth the price of admission.This is exhilerating writing that makes you feel good. Do not miss it.Hot Damn!

After thoroughly enjoying &quot;The Choirboys&quot; I plodded thru this one.There is no doubt it is extremely well written with some strong characters.As I am fan of the fiction mystery novel, perhaps it was the more true crime aspect of the book that caused me to lose interest.Certainly I will read more of Mr. Wambaugh's books, but I will be careful to assure myself it leans to the fiction side. It's for sure he's a wonderful writer...I just caught the wrong topic.KVD

"The Victim" by W.E.B. Griffin is the third (of eight) in his "Badge of Honor" series and it is the charm. Easily the fastest moving of the first three.The central characters are more familiar and their roles more clearly defined.W.E.B. Griffin is a terrific storyteller. He gives just enough back-story to eliminate any confusion for those who pick up the series at random. I recommend reading in order---to see the players evolve. He is also a master at interior dialogue.Two seemingly unrelated shootings, a Mafia hit and a murdered cop supply the mystery. However what keeps you turning pages is his accurate portrayal of the workings of a police department; the loyalty, fealty, courage and camaraderie that connect the force to a common goal.The ending leaves a "more to come" feeling...one more reason to read installment four.

Stuart Woods continues the Will Lee saga in "Capital Crimes." Will Lee, who first appeared in Mr. Woods' Edgar winning debut novel "Chiefs", is now POTUS. The First Lady is Director of the CIA.A extremely intelligent, well-trained and highly motivated assassin is killing conservative, right wing members of government and the media. He uses poison, firearms and explosives with equal competence---all without leaving a trace---so well in fact it appears he must have been trained by a very secret government agency.Will Lee has zero tolerance for inter-agency turf wars and makes certain the CIA, FBI, DEA, ATF, et al share info and cooperate in order to catch the serial killer.Will Lee is the most interesting personality Mr. Woods has created. Unfortunately he stays in the background in "Capital Crimes."The stars here are a pair of FBI Special Agents. Their relentless, clever and astute investigative work in the trackdown drives the plot.Good subplot featuring a jailed disgraced former CIA agent who will provide invaluable information in exchange for a presidential pardon.The two threads meld into a classic finale---the getaway vehicle is destroyed, but no sign of a body. Did this immaculately prepared murderer who has never left a shred of evidence manage to survive?A fast, exhilarating read---but, not as intricate and complex as the earlier Will Lee novels.

Jeff Abbott's "Black Jack Point" is a well-deserved PBO nominee for both the Edgar and Anthony.Justice of the Peace Whit Mosley is a laid back, low key type who is honest, straightforward and to the point---he does not suffer fools.His sidekick Gooch is easily one of the most colorful cronies in print. Gooch's penchant for violence and inclination to work outside the law gets results.The crooks have committed a double murder in their search for treasure buried along the Texas coast by privateer Jean Laffite.One of the vics is the uncle of Whit's gal pal---turns out she is sole heir to his valuable waterfront property.The arrogance of the villains leads to their eventual undoing. They make lousy partners, as they do not trust one another and are busy double-crossing each other as they engage in hijacking, kidnapping and ransom.It is an exciting, suspenseful crime thriller---where it is impossible to tell the good guys from the bad guys and the bad guys from the really bad guys. Lots of wonderful misdirection.The finale is a total shocker.The research into Laffite and his escapades is extensive and an eye opener.

There are books that take time to read, books you make time for and books you steal time for. &quot;Spencerville&quot; is in the latter category...it never left my side from the minute I started it and kept me up late.Great characters, very deeply drawn...both the heroes and villains. I felt I got to know them all. The plot is straight forward, but the journey to its conclusion is fast paced, tense, filled with twists and turns and makes you turn the pages rapidly.There is enough wry humor, sarcasm and cynicism from the protagonist (Keith Landry) and his allies to allow the reader a chance to relax from the nonstop action...refreshing and almost necessary in a book this lengthy.The major bad guy (Cliff Baxter) is truly despicable, but devious, dangerous, deadly and cunning (and he wears a badge). It is quite easy hoping he gets what's due him.I have now read all the novels of Nelson DeMille. Only &quot;Cathedral&quot; was a disappointment. Every other one I highly recommend and still think &quot;The Charm School&quot; is my favorite.

A Michael Connelly endorsement led me to this one.I simply either didn't get it or didn't like it...probably a combination of both.I found it too dark, depressing, bleak, unfun and almost hopeless. I love the LA crime novels of Michael Connelly, Raymond Chandler and Robert Crais, but this was &quot;too out there&quot; for me.Seeing all the five star reviews made me wonder if I was missing something. But, most of them are from California folks. So maybe it wasn't meant for me in the first place. Perhaps one needs to have the California experience to appreciate this. In any event this Florida reader didn't enjoy it.

Vince Flynn's "Executive Power" could easily become the lead story on tomorrow's news. This tale is prescient in its take on the tangled politics of today's Middle East, terrorism and counter-terrorism.The CIA's most efficient field agent (assassin) Mitch Rapp has been called in from the cold and is supposed to become a desk jockey.Situations change, and Mitch takes hands on leadership of a SEAL op to rescue an American family taken hostage in the Philippines by radical Islamic terrorists.The first attempt was blown by leaks traced to the State Department and the Filipino embassy.In a parallel plot we follow Palestinian assassin, David's, crafty strategy to eliminate the heads of numerous Islamic terrorist organizations, the Saudi Ambassador to the U.N. and a Palestinian Ambassador...to throw the blame on the Israelis in order to establish sympathy for establishment of a Palestine state.David and Rapp's paths eventually converge and collide.Mitch is resolute, ruthless, self-assured, indifferent to politics, interested only in getting the mission accomplished.He is fully supported his boss (a strong CIA head) and a heroic POTUS. Rapp's inability to suffer the methodical bureaucrats gets the job done...forget PC.An incredibly accurate portrayal of the politics of retribution filled with intense suspense.A political thriller on the cutting edge that you will be unable to put down.

A solid A for "Garden of Beasts" by Jeffery Deaver. Set against the backdrop of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, it seamlessly combines factual and fictional characters.A US government agency promises mobster hitman Paul Schumann forgiveness if he will eliminate Hitler's architect of rearmament.A cover set up and the chase is on.The feeling of 1936 Germany is an important character as is Schumann's antagonist turned accomplice, German policeman Willi Kohl.Red herrings abound and the twists and turns are addictively tantalizing.

In his fortieth novel Elmore Leonard takes us back to 1930's-era Oklahoma in "The Hot Kid."The kid is Carl (Carlos) Webster, who became a US Deputy Marshall at age twenty-one...his goal is be "America's most famous lawman.""If I have to pull my weapon, I shoot to kill," is his trademark calling card. And, he is quite the lady's man as well.The villain of the piece is millionaire's son, Jack Belmont...as bad as they come...but not a candidate for The Mensa Society. As a teenager he tried to blackmail his father about his mistress---when that failed, he kidnapped the mistress and was surprised when she recognized him. His goal is to be Public Enemy Number 1.True Detective Magazine writer Tony Antonelli is the chronicler of the events that aid Webster's rise to fame. Carl Webster always makes certain to get credit when he shoots someone in the line of duty.Like many of Mr. Leonard's works, a stunning ensemble cast vividly emerges to propel the story along with the inevitable showdowns, gunfights and hair-raising turns. Sardonic, witty and sharp dialogue enlivens the narrative.The so-called heroes are not that much different from the criminals...there are not a lot of noble ambitions on either side of the law. Moral ambiguity and hard-boiled cynicism rule the day.Nonstop action, sly humor, and the cinematic portraits of the women whose desire is to be a "gun moll" of a famous criminal are other high points in this rousing tale.Elmore Leonard, one of our most acclaimed crime writers has hit the bull's-eye once again.

James W. Hall's "Off the Chart" is a suspenseful, complex tale populated with three-dimensional characters in a vibrant setting.A modern day high seas pirate with a Mafia background, a violent psycho pirate wannabe, a former Secretary of Navy working covertly for a black helicopter organization converge to alter the life of confirmed loner Thorn's newly idyllic life.Via deceit and deception the villains coerce and convince Thorn's best friend Sugarman and girl friend Alexandra to abandon him---leaving Thorn to fend for himself versus the land-grabbing pirates.In the attempt to seize Thorn's valuable five acres of waterfront property, the pirates abduct Sugarman's nine-year-old daughter---introducing a ticking clock subplot that leads to a nightmare confrontation.The crisply written high octane pacing never slows as the action moves from the Keys to the middle of the ocean to the Central American jungles.Jim Hall never disappoints---superior in every way.

"Deception Point" is another fast paced Dan Brown cliffhanger that I could not put down.Parallel plots of pro-NASA incumbent POTUS vs opponent who wants NASA to become a private, for profit agency (with many aerospace dollars in his campaign war chest)---and the discovery of scientific proof of life beyond Earth make the pages fly by.While under fire for lack of achievement and overspending, a NASA satellite detects a meteor buried in the arctic...It is said to contain fossils verifying life existed elsewhere.President Herney wants certainty---sends a team of independent specialists to authenticate before announcing the find.One expert is Rachel Sexton, intelligence community liaison to POTUS. She questions the Ph.D. specialists with "what ifs"---and it appears that a scientific hoax has been executed.Whoever is behind the subterfuge is willing to wipe out the entire team of specialists to protect the lie with a Delta Force squad.Tension, suspense, action and good old-fashioned skullduggery propel the flight to elude the assassins and uncover the mastermind behind the conspiracy.With the findings of the latest (August, 2003) NASA investigations, it is remarkable how prophetic Dan Brown's fictional NASA is to the real thing.

Peter Robinson's "Close to Home" is a gem...one sensational read. Reading it is like watching an exquisite ballplayer at work...he makes the writing look so easy that only a thoughtful examination will clue you in as to how ingenious the writing is.Chief Inspector Alan Banks is called home from vacation when a body dumped in 1965 is unearthed. Turns out the body is that of Graham Marshall, a boyhood pal of CI Banks.In his own district, Banks is investigating a missing person, turned kidnapping, turned homicide. The victim is a teenager, about the same age as was Graham Marshall when he disappeared."They were linked in his mind in some odd way. Not technically, of course. But two very different boys from very different times had ended up dead before their time, and both had died violently."Banks has able assistants in both cases: Michelle Hart in the Marshall case and Annie Cabbot on the current case.The police procedural on both matters is detailed, captivating and all three detectives have an instinct for crime solving.Banks is a keen observer of humanity and a man of integrity...a marvelous protagonist. In each case the whydunit will uncover whodunit.I plan to go back and read the entire series. This is the first British mystery that has grabbed my attention in forever.The pages absolutely glided by.

The DNA of Ross Thomas' novels contains unpredictability, witty urbane dialogue, inventive plotting, intricate double (and triple) dealing and a rogue's gallery of quirky characters."Cast a Yellow Shadow" (1967) is the second in his Mac and Padillo series featuring two guys who just want to operate a nice bar and grill after their cold war time.Nevertheless, the saloon keepers are caught up in political skullduggery because of Padillo's enforced activities for the CIA.Mac's wife has been kidnapped to ensure that Padillo will assassinate a South African prime minister.The other side is offering cash for Padillo not to pull the trigger.For a couple of old soldiers of fortune, this mess should be no problem---except that whether Padillo does the shooting or not, Mac's wife is going to die.Padillo enlists the aid of a trio of foreign double agents he has tuned and Mac gets some helpers from the local criminal element.The scheme is hatched to free Mac's wife and the chase is on as clever devious people try to outfox one another. Who will pull the double cross, who will stay loyal?Like crossword puzzle fans, readers will delight at how neatly all the pieces fit.Ross Thomas: always surprising, always entertaining!

Met the author at book signing while on holiday in Scottsdale at Poisoned Pen. Very impressive background and charming speaker. No doubt it is a first novel, but it contains lots of strong moments. Mr. Oliver's discussion of where his protagonist is going (and growing) whet the appetite for more of Moody. Moody and his associates in Spokane can make you laugh and make you cry. You cannot help but care about them. Interesting plot that is fully resolved.

"The Ice Harvest" by Scott Phillips is an interesting first novel.It is light entertainment...a noirish dark mystery/comedy.Filled with irony, it is set on Christmas eve in Wichita in 1979. The major character is Charlie Arglist, a ill-fated lawyer for the owner of some local strip clubs.He has a big scam going, skimming off the top. But then, everyone is scamming everyone...and the need to eliminate some participants along the way seems only natural.Charlie gets in and out of many jams that night as he attempts to make his getaway. How he is rewarded at the conclusion is the ultimate irony.It is short, to the point and a snap to read. A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.

I have enjoyed RNP's legal thrillers and looked forward to this one. However, my disappointment matches that of the other reviewers.I had to assign myself fifty pages a day to complete this one. In a word it was a task. Confusing, way too dark, no sympathetic characters, boring and tedious.Mr. Patterson is capable of much better, so I kept reading hoping for the enjoyment to begin...it never happened for me. I was just relieved to finish.Someone once told me that &quot;life is too short for a bad book.&quot; I think he had this book in mind.

Ross Thomas wrote "The Procane Chronicle" and "Protocol for a Kidnapping" in 1971.Both are first class capers featuring "go-between" extraordinaire Philip St. Ives.Abner Procane is the "world's best thief" and shares the same lawyer as St. Ives.Procane has kept meticulous journals on every job he has pulled. The entire scheme is minutely detailed.When the journals are stolen, St. Ives is chosen as the go-between to recover them.The recovery is flawless...but the pages containing the particulars to Procane's next job are missing.What to do? The choices are many, and the chase is on.Amfred Killingsworth is the US Ambassador stationed in Belgrade.Some of his actions have made him an embarrassment and he has accrued some info that if made public could discomfit US interests in the region.The CIA pulls the snatch and shifts the blame to others.St. Ives is coerced by the State Department to be the go-between in the exchange. Midway into the escapade, St. Ives figures it is a ruse, but he is in too deeply to back out.Altering his already complex switch and escape, St. Ives working on the fly pulls it off...but not without major snags.From one tricky situation to another, the action is nonstop.Ross Thomas is a master at keeping the reader guessing.I consider it an important victory if I am only a page or two behind Mr. Thomas as I try to deduce the whodunit or whydunit in his novels.Ross Thomas keeps you off balance in a most enjoyable fashion.

Jack Higgins is a terrific storyteller. This was my first Higgins novel and the pages flew by. Reading this book was like eating peanuts...I could not stop and finished in two sessions.An absolute complete suspension of disbelief is the best way to approach this one as it stretches credulity to beyond the max...but it is great fun. And, what is fiction all about, if not for suspension of disbelief? Some of the situations the protagonists get out of would make James Bond proud.In the setup, the first quarter of the book is pretty credible and then the fun begins. The action switches between Washington, New York, London and Ireland...lots of Concorde flights, tony parties and champaign between the gun shots. The good guys are interesting characters and the bad guys seem a match for them due to their mole inside the White House. The reader is clued into the mole's identity early on, so we know whodunit...so we have to watch the clock to see if the good guys can figure it out in time.It was an enjoyable read all in all. The protagonists are continuing characters and it appears their ranks increased by one in &quot;The White House Connections.&quot; That's good news for Higgins' fans as he is a prolific writer.That said, it was &quot;too Brit&quot; and &quot;too IRA&quot; for me to become addicted to the series. It was a fun one-time interlude for someone who prefers the good old American hardboiled mystery. For those who like the British touch, this series is a keeper.

"Mr. Lucky," Jim Swain's fifth Tony Valentine novel serves up an insider's peek into the world of gambling's scams, grifts and cheats...both the casinos and the gamblers schemes and techniques.All the cons and rip-offs in his books have actually been pulled off. Casino cheating is a multi-billion dollar industry.Tony Valentine is a retired Atlantic City cop who now consults casinos who are being cheated from his Florida home.In the main plot, Tony investigates Ricky Smith, a seemingly ill fated average schmoo who cannot lose...wins $ 1 million from the casino, beats a World Series of Poker winner at his own game, hits a hometown lottery, a charity raffle and wins big at the off-track betting parlor.The casino is suspicious...they cannot tell how he did it...so they put Tony on the case and withhold the winnings until the investigation is concluded.Tony takes his investigation to Ricky's home town...the small town of Slippery Rock...and sends his son (and business partner) to question the losing poker player, Tex "All-in" Snyder in Gulfport.The hunt to decipher the methods of cheating is complicated by a myriad of dead ends, Dixie Mafia types and Ricky's own sly cleverness.The novel is packed with superb characters that inhabit the periphery connecting what is legal and what is not...the connection between good guys and bad guys (often affable) helps drive the plot.Tony Valentine is a fully-conceived, complex character who is easy to root for."Mr. Lucky" is a big winner.At a book signing Jim said he has already completed his next two books in the Tony Valentine series..."there are so many cons and cheating schemes out there, that I have an absolutely endless supply of material for many novels to come."

"McHally's Dare" by Vincent Lardo is yet another pleasant romp amongst the rich and infamous on the island of Palm Beach by Discrete Inquirer Archy McNally.The twelfth installment contains a more complex plot as Archy attempts to solve a murder and determine if an apparent heir to a fortune is an imposter, all the while lunching in fashionable bistros and attending parties and benefits.The eclectic supporting cast is terrific as usual...lending color, intrigue, witty dialog and interesting sidebars.Archy has no shortage of suspects and eventually brings the truth to light...but not before a couple of reversals, amusing detours and romantic interludes."McNally's Dare" is not hard boiled noir...rather a mystery in the wry...easy to enjoy...a weekend diversion...a book for the beach...a guilty pleasure.Big time fun!

I found "no there, there" in John Gilstrap's "Scott Free."Had I desired a soap opera I would choose Howard Fast or Harold Robbins and enjoy the ride with guilty pleasure.All I wanted to do was slap the mother, send the son to military school and have the father see a shrink.As if the central characters were not unsympathetic enough, the exploits of the son were beyond absurd.I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but this was ridiculous.On the plus side it is a fast read. Many of the secondary characters are worthy, especially the cops...and the villain is colorful, interesting and entertaining.Mr. Gilstrap's "Nathan's Run" remain a favorite---I expected much more.

Thought Jack Reacher was a wonderful protagonist. Plot offered great entertainment and allowed one to indulge in a well crafted conspiracy theory. Saw a review that compared Reacher to Stephen Hunter's Bob Lee Swagger. I cannot go that far, but I may upgrade Reacher when I read the rest of the series. I did not find the violence offputting, after a number of the reader reviews spoke negatively of those scenes. To me they were pretty much brief passages except for the Sam Peckinpahlike slow motion sequence of the final fight. While many bad guys were eliminated, their demises were pretty much, &quot;I was here, they were there, they had these weapons, I had these weapons, I had to accomplish this in this manner.&quot; Then he does it. The characters, the howdoneit and the intrigue occupy the great majority of the book...and they are first rate. I look forward to more Jack Reacher.

A wonderfully written and richly textured novel. Very well plotted and it makes sense thru-out.Some passages were so well written I found myself reading them three or four times just to appreciate their beauty.It is at least semi-dark and not the fastest read, but well worth the time and effort. It needs to be savored.The protagonists are well drawn and this should be a strong series. The supporting cast is most intriguing.

A cast of quirky characters as befits the Elmore Leonard tradition. Sort of &quot;crooks do the dumbest things.&quot; Some of the so called good guys aren't too bright either.With one crook whose goal is to rob a bank in every state, a girl friend who is certain Elvis is still alive and a partner who feared his grandmother could turn him into an owl, the stage is set for some laughs amongst the criminal hi-jinks.The snappy Elmore Leonard dialog is here with a well paced plot. The action has a nice sensible flow.While I prefer it when Mr. Leonard sets his novels in Florida, &quot;Killshot&quot; a most pleasant escapist read. Nothing deep...just good fun and reading enjoyment. It's in the Carl Hiaasen a/o Laurence Shames vein.

Stephen Hunter is simply a spectacular story teller. This is the latest in the Swagger saga and could be considered the prequel. &quot;Hot Springs&quot; presents the back story of Earl Swagger (Bob Lee a.k.a. &quot;Bob the Nailer's&quot; father.)Earl returns from the Pacific campaign a Medal of Honor winner...a true hero. He is tapped to ramrod a strike force whose agenda is to put an end to the illicit activities so pervasive in Hot Springs, mostly controlled by Owney Maddox. The head of the strike force has grand polical ambitions, so Earl's enemies and allies both work against him.Mr. Hunter brings the likes of Harry Truman, Bugsy Siegel, Virginia Hill, Mickey Rooney and Alan Ladd in for cameo appearances and sets the 1946 scene to perfection in many subtle ways.The book moves at warp speed. You are compelled to turn pages in an attempt to keep up with the action.The story is presented from the minds of four or five main characters in alternating chapters so when you want to learn the outcome of one situation you must enjoy three or four more chapters to get that particular resolution. Like eating peanuts, you cannot read just one chapter.Mr. Hunter delivers a nonstop action read laced with taut suspense and peopled with rich, well defined characters. No one (heroes especially) is perfect and this novel is hard boiled noir at its very best.

Laura Lippman's eighth Tess Monaghan novel, "By A Spider's Thread" is a provocative, savvy, challenging thriller.Precise plotting, an economical cast of realistic characters (some appealing, some detestable) and a plausible resolution make the pages disappear in a trice.Mark Rubin, a wealthy Jewish furrier whose wife (Natalie) and three children have vanished, hires Tess to locate them.Mark and Tess get off to a rocky beginning as Mark withholds information about his family and omits details about contacts that could illuminate Tess's search.Tess is resourceful and they gradually warm to one another. As Tess learns more about Mark's family, marriage and religious identity, the reasons for Natalie's disappearance start to materialize.Family secrets underlie the plot and provide the motive for the mastermind behind the disappearance.The story is told from multiple points of view...that of Tess and the parallel view from the observant and bright eldest child.This works and leaves enough blanks to fill in to keep you guessing and on your toes.Laura Lippman is masterful at filling in the pertinent background with the backwards and forwards story telling.Equally important is the way she builds the tension, suspense and impact with character development rather than gratuitous violence.The multilayered, absorbing narrative has enormous momentum and clever details.Easily the best in the Tess Monaghan series and a powerful follow-up to last year's spectacular "Every Secret Thing."

One does not simply read Laura Lippman's "To the Power of Three"...one becomes immersed in it.Told from multiple points of view, it is in fact a character driven novel. The secondary characters are just as vivid and infused with distinct personalities and back stories as those in the lead roles.Three suburban high school seniors (inseparable since third grade) are involved in a shooting in a locked girl's restroom...one dead, one in a coma and one shot in the foot.What precisely did go down in the restroom? Who in fact pulled the trigger?Homicide Sergeant Harold Lendardt and partner Kevin Infante come across inconsistencies between the crime scene and account given by the coherent survivor.The setting in the upscale development of Glendale is illusory, but the way the "event" affects the entire community is all too authentic.Everyone is so fully realized, it is effortless to picture the novel as nonfiction. They all resonate with authenticity.And, the plot is crisp, suspenseful, taut and moves along in a calculated rhythm. The reader is enticed to learn more about all the players...and care about them."To the Power of Three" hooks you from start to finish.

It took me a while to get on the George Pelecanos bandwagon, but with "Hell to Pay" I am in the fan club.He is a writer of substance in the Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Lee Child, James W. Hall category."Hell to Pay" is the second Derek Strange/Terry Quinn novel. It is set in the murkier regions of Washington. The malaise of the Washington the media does not cover is addressed and exposed.A terrific cat and mouse that produces surprising allies. Every guess you will make will turn out wrong.The soundtrack from WPGC reverberates throughout the book, and the pop culture references are everywhere.A spectacular series, not to be missed.

Consider the FIVR STAR rating for both of Mr. Liddy's techno thriller novels...this one and &quot;Out of Control.&quot;While they 1990 and 1980 copywrites they give the same high degree of thrills today. Both are tension filled, taunt plots.Certainly Mr. Liddy is well qualified to write of &quot;special ops&quot; and he pulls no punches. I could not put down either book. And, with his creditials suspension of disbelief is at at minimum.My hope is that he will do more and if he writes one every ten years, could 2000 be the date for another action packed page turner?Great stuff!

I usually have big fun reading LMcM's novels, but this one fell far short of the mark. I guess I really prefer his novels set in the old West and other action fare.Most of the characters just wore me out. Sort of wanted to slap them. Pretty silly in spots. And, how can a bunch of adults be bossed around by a five year of kid. The dog jumping off the Statue of Liberty and living was another aspect that was hard to accept. Thinking back, it's hard to come up with a character I could really care about.On the plus side, it was a fast read and the usual interesting McMurtry dialog was always present.Mr. McMurtry has given me so much reading pleasure in the past that I will still await his future offerings. No one bats 1.000, so he's entitled to a miss.

As a major fan of Michael Connelly, Robert Crais and Raymond Chandler and the LA they picture, I know I should enjoy James Ellroy. However, he just doesn't do it for me.I have now read three of his novels and doubt I will try any more.&quot;The Big Nowhere&quot; was too long, tedious and confusing for my tastes.A couple of the main characters were quite interesting and I looked forward to following their escapades. But overall the novel just was too &quot;over the top&quot; for me.While I finish the books of Messrs. Connelly, Crais and Chandler in a couple of days, Mr. Ellroy's take me over a week. I do not try to steal time for him as I do those other wonderful writers of crime mysteries set in LA.KVD

I have become a fan of John Leslie as well as his Gideon Lowry series.Set in Key West it is peopled with the quirky types found in the southern most piece of land in the USA. The native Key Westers (conchs) have a strong sense of place and are protective of their own and the town.What appears to be suicide doesn't seem so to PI Gideon Lowry and off he goes to find the real answer. Along the way robbery, double dealing, smoke screens and red herrings turn up. The confusion mounts to the point where Gideon even wonders if his distant cousin (Judge Just Watson) is involved.Many a twist and turn sprinkled amongst the picturesque Key West sunsets, ocean breezes and humid air. It's a fun read.I guess John Leslie and Laurence Shames are my favorite Key West mystery writers and &quot;Love For Sale&quot; was a fast read. The characters are clearly defined, the pace is quick without be frantic and all in all the action is believable.With Gideon's cousin getting married and sort of adopting his bride's twentysomething child it appears a couple of new continuing characters have been added and I look forward to their further adventures.

In "Partner in Crime" J.A. Jance brings the lead characters of her two series together.Seattle Special Investigator for the Washington Attorney General, J.P.

The murder "weapon" will truly make you stop and think.When a second body turns up the territorial feud ceases and the two protagonists work together to find whodunit.J.A. Jance writes in a fluid style that you glide thru. It is solid plot, well paced, with likeable characters. It's a complex, suspenseful story dominated by J.P. and Joanna. The scenes are beautifully set. The introspective subplots do not detract from the investigation.J.P.'s part is told in the first person, while Sheriff Brady's is third person narrative---quirky, but it works.After reading "Partner in Crime" you will be checking your artificial sweetener packets carefully.

I have only recently "discovered" Ed McBain's "87th Precinct" novels, and have been reading them in random order. Like all the others, "Nocturne" was a rapid paced page-turner.The two simultaneous plots are filled with characters with jaunty attitudes on both sides of the law---hookers, pushers. cops, wackos, pimps.The two cases crisscross and dovetail into the same place. The ride to that place is filled with suspense with lotsa twists and turns.Along the way, each cleared suspect leads to another and another until all the pieces meld into the solved puzzle. It is police procedural at its best.I was hooked in no time and could not put "Nocturne" down.

Protagonist, Gabriel Allon is an art restorer/Israeli secret agent in this thought provoking, intricately plotted, fast paced thriller.At the heart of the novel is the Swiss collaboration with the Nazis in the theft of priceless art during WWII.It is a tale filled with multi-dimensional complex characters---you feel you know everyone of the large cast of supporting characters.It is a story of secrets and betrayals that lures you in and hooks you in the prologue. The bona fide sounding historical detail and alluring foreign intrigue add to this crisply written and polished suspenseful story.Daniel Silva is a master of this genre. All five of his books have hooked me early and never let me go. An exquisite author.I read it in two sessions.If you have yet to discover Daniel Silva, now is not too soon.

This is well written account of a boy's journey thru high school in the rural South, in the early 1900's.By all means it is a rich accounting, peopled with some interesting characters and descriptive passages.I much prefer the mystery/action/thriller novels, so this moves rather slowly for me. However, it's a nice change of pace.Most realistic and contains great insight into the people, time and place.

James Patterson creates stories that make pages turn at a rapid pace.I thought the first half packed more punch as Alex Cross finally gets closure on the Gary Soneji case. Very intense and absolutely riveting.The second part where the hunt for &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; transpires up and down the East Coast is more oriented to the psychological aspects and gripping in its own right.I thought Gary Soneji to be a more loathsome villain than Mr. Smith. The other members of the police, FBI and Interpol that Alex Cross and his partner Sampson work with are believable and easy to cheer for.Putting the clues together that Mr. Smith has left after his crimes is great intellectual drama.The murders Mr. Smith commits are very gruesome. Their descriptions are very graphic and maybe a little over the top. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary.Overall a fine read. Another strong outing from Mr. Patterson.KVD

I have enjoyed previous Barbara Parker books as well her characters Gail and Anthony. I am also a major fan of the great collection of Florida mystery writers. This book misses for me for the same reasons other Sunshine State writers have. When they get into the Cuban exile politics my interest wanders. If I want political intrigue, I'll read a political intrigue novel. But, when I pick up a mystery novel by a familiar writer I have no patience for the exile story. Miami has more than enough murder, mystery and crime to draw upon (log on the Miami Herald)and keep readers turning pages without politicizing the Cuban migration. On the plus side, Ms.Parker draws wonderfully clear characters and paints outstanding word pictures of Dade County. When she keeps it to the courtroom procedure and amateur sleuthing I find her books far more compelling.

Harlan Coben is the only writer to win the Edgar, Shamus and Anthony for the same novel ("Fade Away").I thought he should have won the Edgar last year for "Tell No One." And, believe "Gone for Good" was one of 2002's best novels.They were sophisticated, believable and filled with sheer psychological terror.However, I was completely underwhelmed by "No Second Chance."I found the protagonist too sanctimonious, disingenuous and self-serving to cheer for. His continual self-analysis bogged down the plot pace and I found it difficult to care for any of the main characters.Overall it seemed hurriedly thrown together.There was some snappy dialog and a few colorful secondary characters.The cops were well drawn...and Verne, the redneck gun nut with the mail order bride stole the show for me.

J.A. Jance is a gifted story teller and I have become quite the Joanna Brady fan. &quot;Outlaw Mountain&quot; spends a bunch of time on Joanna's personal life, but has enough plot and subplots going on that the action outdistances the soap opera. Joanna and her immediate circle continue to grow as characters and are easy to care about. The setting is wonderful, the plots resolved in a believable manner and I look forward to the next installment. Also enjoy J.A.Jance's other series set in Seattle featuring J.P. Beaumont.

Iris Johansen's "Body of Lies" is a fairly entertaining novel.The cat and mouse aspect is well done, as the hunted do not use super human powers to keep on the move. As the story progresses, a ticking clock subplot propels the action.A secret society lends an almost credible conspiracy theory to the mix.Throw in a resourceful hardboiled British bodyguard with a dubious background, a corrupt Senator, a seemingly average reporter, a skillful assassin and a covert research project involving fuel cells and things move rapidly.Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan is terrific when doing her job recreating the face on the skull of an unknown murder victim. When fretting about her romance everything bogs down and becomes a pitiful soap opera.Colorful villains, some wolves in sheep's clothing and the nefarious secret organization keep Eve and Atlanta detective Joe Quinn hopping and the pages turning.The ending was too pat.

Ken Follett is among the best at writing thrillers that hook you and never let you go.In interviews, he acknowledged that "Eye of the Needle" was his breakthrough novel. It surely deserves all the praise it has received.In 1940, the The Abwehr, (German Intelligence), has planted their finest agent in Great Britain---code name "The Needle." Using the name Henry Faber, he works as a railway clerk and attempts to be invisible.Using his bicycle for transportation, he observes all the war preparations and anything that would be helpful for the German bombers.As the war progresses, Faber continues his adroit undercover work---radioing the info back to The Fatherland.Meanwhile the Allies are utilizing a disinformation campaign designed to convince the Germans that the European Invasion (D-Day) will take place at Pas de Calais. Ships and tanks that are merely rubber and timber, barracks that were a movie set, etc. were utilized to persuade the enemy that Patton had a huge Army ready to invade.Double agents that MI5 had turned churned out radio reports furthering the deception.If the Germans learn of the great ruse, thousands could be lost. The Needle chances upon the phony barracks and tanks and knows this info must be delivered in person to the Fuhrer.However, he has to eliminate some Allied soldiers who spot him as he leaves the fake army base. Their discovery leads to cat and mouse chase.His escape via U-Boat 505 off the North Sea coast is hampered by a violent squall grounding all sea and air transportation. Faber is shipwrecked on a remote rock island with four inhabitants. There he must perpetuate his counterfeit persona until the weather clears.Meanwhile, MI5 is closing in while working on the scant clues Faber leaves in his wake. They too are hampered by the weather.The novel moves at a measured pace that heightens the suspense with each turn of the page. Faber is great villain whose cunning keeps him a step ahead MI5. The crew from MI5 are dogged in their pursuit and thorough in the procedural methodology. It is a remarkable match up.Using an economical cast, all the characters are fully fleshed out. You know everyone quite well.While the last 48 hours before the weather clears are intensely gripping, the entire narrative is mesmerizing and attention grabbing. This is a breathtaking "what if" take on an important slice of history.Since we all know how WWII turned out, the outcome may never be in doubt...but how MI5 closes the trap is a superb ride.

Stephen J. Clark's "Dark Delivery" is the suspenseful sequel to the Edgar nominated "Southern Latitudes"---and just as intense.Written in alternate first person chapters, the reader knows only what the two protagonists do.Nelson Ingram, a ne'er do well newspaperman has returned to his small southern hometown---and is befriended by Dr. Seymore Hartley, a 75 year old cancer victim.As he uncovers the town's dark secrets, Nelson attracts trouble and mayhem, but finds causes and people worth fighting for.Cuban freedom fighters, Tampa Mafiosos and free lance opportunists all want a piece of the cash, notebooks and discs from the money laundering scheme Nelson uncovered.Since Nelson's relationship with the authorities is tenuous at best, Nelson and the doctor must resort to vigilante justice to survive.Nelson and Dr. Hartley are propelled from one disaster to another---unable to tell friend from foe, are forced to make life and death determinations with incomplete info.Burnt out Vietnam vet Clint McConnyhead is a memorable character whose LuRRP training helps Nelson and Seymore outwit their adversaries.Strong characters on both sides, high octane action and wonderful dialog make Stephen J. Clark a writer to pay attention to.

The lavish release party aboard the yacht was supposed to launch Bison Records' new pop artist, Tamar Valparaiso. Instead, the diva-to-be is kidnapped (while channel 4's cameras are rolling)---and the chase is on in Ed McBain's latest 87th Precinct novel, "The Frumious Bandersnatch."A joint task force in set up to solve the high profile case as Tamar's CD goes to #1. Representing the 87th is Detective Steve Carella.Put the FBI, the music industry types, the scoop seeking press, the usual assortment of the big bad city's criminal element and a dollop of misdirection in the mix and you have yet another highly entertaining 87th Precinct read.As usual in this series, the plot is fairly uncomplicated. It is the familiar galaxy of characters surrounding Carella, and Mr. McBain's deft implementation of the story line that makes this police procedural resonate. The interplay between the characters and crackling dialogue is priceless.The subplot features Ollie Weeks and his burgeoning relationship with fellow cop, Patricia Gomez.Carella's good old-fashioned police work cracks the case. The FBI and all their high tech toys fail to deliver.Big fun!!!

Having been disappointed in &quot;North of Havana&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Invented Florida&quot; I started &quot;Captiva&quot; apprehensively. It did not take long to find the Doc Ford adventure I had missed.Peopled with great quirky, colorful characters; both good and evil...a clear plot and a couple of red herrings, this one moved at a nice pace. The last one hundred pages truly went at warp speed.For me, this is Randy Wayne White at his best. As usual, Florida is a major character, as it should be. The feel for Florida is unmistakingly powerful and Doc Ford is just a great protagonist. The culture and community of those who live aboard boats is well documented. There are so many realistic touches, that it becomes easy to give credibility to the entire storyline.Pure enjoyment, satisfying resolution, interesting subplots, beautiful word pictures...a Doc Ford novel not to be missed.

I found Dan Brown's "Angels &amp; Demons" as exciting and suspenseful as his blockbuster "Da Vinci Code."At times it is hard to believe it is a work of fiction.This time the ancient secret society that is causing havoc today is the Illuminati, an underground order with a vendetta against the Catholic Church.It is both cat and mouse as well as ticking clock.The present day Illuminati has stolen enough antimatter to level the Vatican---set to go off during the Papal Conclave to elect a new Pope. If not located the church's symbolic property as well as its leadership will be destroyed.To uncover the location of the antimatter Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon must discover and discern hidden messages and symbols in Rome's ancient art. It seems his pursuer has the inside information to prevent Langdon from accomplishing his task.Who is the betrayer? The head of CERN (inventor of the antimatter), the Cardinal overseeing the election, the former Pope's Camerlengo, the Commander of the Swiss Guards or his second-in-command?High-octane adventure that never slows. Requires an occasional bit of suspension of disbelief a la James Bond.The brotherhood of the Illuminati is genuine.The connection between the USA's founding fathers and the Illuminati is an historical controversy to this day.Impossible to put down. Not to be missed.

Ken Follett's "Hornet Flight" is a fast paced page burner set at the start of WWII. With locales in Denmark and Great Britain, it blends fact and fiction. Mr. Follett is at his best when the setting is WWII.The plot shows how the heroic action of a few individuals behind the lines can alter the outcome of war. The Nazis are still the ultimate bad guys in fact and fiction and it is always fun to see them outwitted.The characters are quite strong, believable and they really come alive.There are enough twists and turns to make you wonder if the protagonists will triumph---as these Nazis are not portrayed as buffoons---they are worthy adversaries.While there are some predicable resolutions, overall it is a fascinating, irresistible read filled with plenty of tension.

"Chicago Confidential" is the twelfth Nathan Heller novel from Max Allan Collins.It is a deft blending of true crime and mystery fiction---an astonishing mix of fact and fiction. His theories and conclusions are most convincingIt is not a whodunit---rather it is about a famous time in crime. It is 1950 in Chicago as the initial congressional inquiry into organized crime is starting up.Heller runs the A-1 Detective Agency and is not mobbed up, but still has no desire to testify before Kefauver's committee.Heller's ability to work with the underworld figures as well as the law is what makes his agency successful.Ambitious politicos, rancorous gangsters and a couple of honest cops are the central figures Heller must deal with.Snappy dialog, menacing action sequences and scrupulous historical research make this hard-boiled thriller a treat.Among the real characters interacting with the concocted ones: Jayne Mansfield, Frank Sinatra, Drew Pearson, Sam Giancana, Senator Joe McCarthy.

J.A. Jance writes with such a fluid style that I glide right thru her novels. Her books are easy to read and comprehend. I particularly enjoy the Joanna Brady series.In &quot;Devil's Claw&quot; there are plenty of suspects to go around, a couple of running subplots and an ever growing cast of regulars.J.A. Jance does a great job of filling in the background of the continuing characters...enough info to set their place and position for first time readers of the series; but not so much that familiar readers are bored or insulted with the data.It's a pleasure to observe how the characters develop and grow as the series progresses. The scenic setting of Southern Arizona is always well done...you can almost see those great sunsets.Plotting, character evolvement, red herrings all give the reader plenty of times to solve things along with Sheriff Brady.J.A. Jance does a great job balancing the whodunit aspect with Sheriff Brady's personal life without detracting from the main plot. The reader also gets a good view of the &quot;unglamorous&quot; aspect of the sheriff's job...meetings, personel problems, budgets, civic speaking engagements and the like.This is just a wonderful series, and &quot;Devil's Claw&quot; is a welcome addition to the Joanna brady legacy.

Vincent Lardo's Archy McNally is feeling more and more comfortable to me. It's tough to take over for a writer as loved as Lawrence Sanders, but Mr. Lardo is up to the challenge.This time Archy's parents are away on a cruise and his female love interest is barely seen. That certainly keeps those characters fresh for future Mcnally exploits, and seems a good ploy to me.Even his crony in the Palm Beach Police Department has a lower than usual profile this time. Archy's pal Binky has the biggest part among the usual recurring characters, so we get to share his misadventures.It's the usual lighthearted romp among the rich and infamous on the island of Palm Beach. Lots of setup and many a red herring along the way, punctuated with a fair share of laughs.If you are looking for a deep and complicated hardboiled noirish mystery, look elsewhere...but if a little tongue in cheek and mystery-lite sounds like a good change of pace, then &quot;McNally's Chance&quot; is for you.It is fast read and an enjoyable book from start to finish.Enjoy this one.

"Double Play" by Robert Parker defies classification.It centers on the 1947 baseball season when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier...so there is baseball.The Dodgers feel Robinson requires a bodyguard and pick Joseph Burke. Burke is a physically and emotionally wounded Guadalcanal Marine sharp shooter. He has no feelings and nothing to lose, follows orders and shoots straight...in other words, the perfect choice to protect Robinson.The plot to kill Robinson originates with a New York mob boss. Burke's astute manipulations of the mob and the Harlem gangsters combine to save the day. So there is mystery and gunplay.Mr. Parker alternates the death threat story with recollections of his own childhood as a fan of the Dodgers.Nostalgic period detail paints the scene with atmospheric touches like vintage songs, network radio shows, Red Barber calling the games and 1947 box scores.But it is the relationship between Robinson and Burke that carries the story in this lean, taut, intricate, poignant novel.While it is Burke who thwarts the assassination of Jackie Robinson, it is Robinson who truly saves Burke.In the Parker tradition, Burke is "someone who plays the game, protecting those who follow the rules and punishing those who don't. We call him a hero."

Few crime novelists can hook you like George Pelecanos. His 1994 stand-alone "Shoedog" was out-of-print until last fall in paperback....great news!There are no good guys in this tale of violence, extreme betrayal and social realism. Every character is morally questionable. Like great film-noir, the cast is either anti-hero or villain.After drifting worldwide for seventeen years, Constantine decides to hitchhike back to DC. He accepts a ride from an older hood called Polk (everyone in "Shoedog" goes by one name).Outside DC, Polk needs to make a stop to "collect some dough."That stop sets a dreadfully dark caper in motion for Constantine.A dual liquor robbery in DC on payday...two inside men on both jobs and a driver. Well cased and set up...it looks okay...and no one has a chance to say no.In the great noir tradition a woman upsets loyalties and outsiders are after Polk.The d&eacute;nouement is stunning and will resound in your mind for an extensive period.Packed with remarkable dialogue, suspense, treachery, fanatical duplicity and filled with superb pop culture references, "Shoedog" is best read in black and white.

I could easily just say &quot;ditto&quot; to Mr. Gonnella's review. There was some clever writing and witty dialog in the fist quarter of the book. Then it bogged down. Too many characters, too many flashbacks, too many subplots...just confusion. I did manage to read the entire book and it got slower as it came to a conclusion...just the opposite of what I look for in a thriller.

It was a perfect setting for a magnificent read.Call &amp; McCrea, their adversaries and allies come to life in technicolor.Spent one day hiking the Canyon's South Rim, stopping to rest and read and what a way to enjoy this great portrayer of the American West.Don't think it would have mattered where I read it as it was quite a treat. Being in the Grand Canyon was just a bonus.I have yet to be disappointed in a McMurtry novel and these characters are full of life, color and verve.

While there is plenty of mystery, page-turning suspense and all the thriller aspects---more than anything, P.J. Parrish's "Island of Bones" is a marvelously intriguing tale peopled with powerfully motivated characters.A hurricane deposits a baby's scull at PI, Louis Kincaid's beach bungalow. Days later, a woman's body washes up nearby. Are these two related to the disappearances of seven young women from the area over a thirty-five year period?Ft. Myers Police Chief Al Horton feels Louis can be useful on the high profile case by "baby-sitting" his Chief of Detectives (Mel Landeta), who appears to be a serious burnout case.Louis's client fears her father (librarian Frank Woods) is somehow involved with the missing women. Newspaper clippings she finds in his possession and his flight appear to confirm her worries. Is he a serial killer, where are the bodies and where is Frank?Adroitly plotted, richly textured, a strong sense of place and smartly written, "Island of Bones" seizes the reader and keeps you immersed.The ending is a shocker as the past melds into the present. The journey is irresistible, compelling and rings true.Louis is a resourceful, self-reliant, persuasive lead character. As he doggedly follows the trail and clues, he learns not everyone is what they appear to be and surprising allegiances are formed."This place is built on skeletons, young man. Millions of humans, millions of sea animals, dead and gone. Florida is just one long island of bones."

The sisters Montee who write as P.J. Parrish have outdone themselves in an "Unquiet Grave."They have bumped up their writing and the character of Louis Kincaid to a higher plain in the seventh novel in this wonderful series.Louis is now a PI on Florida's Gulf Coast. His foster father (Phillip Lawrence) asks Louis to return home (Michigan) to help locate the remains of his first true love (Claudia De Foe).She was long considered dead, but when her casket was unearthed for relocation, it was filled with rocks.Claudia was confined at Hidden Lake, an insane asylum, and was buried in their cemetery.One employee (Nurse Alice) remains at Hidden Lake cleaning up the files and readying the place for demolition. She becomes the inside ally Louis needs to begin his investigation.Inquiries made by Louis attract enemies, antagonize the State Police & provoke further violence. There is no doubt that foul play was involved in Claudia's death as Hidden Lake holds many sinister, haunting and disturbing enigmas.Louis's hunt for Claudia's bones develops into part of a larger investigation to find a present day murderer as mutilated bodies turn up at Hidden Lake.A sleazy tabloid journalist who believes a serial killer (incarcerated at Hidden Lake, supposedly dead for eight years) is the current killer become a most unlikely ally.The journey to the finale is stylishly presented and intelligently resolved.While on the case, Louis confronts many of his childhood demons and resolves them enough for some peace with who he is. He truly grows as a character in this tale of suspense of the highest order.Just spectacular.

105 chapters, 104 cliffhangers that defy you to put down Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code."This book easily lives up to its hype and New York Times debut at #1."The Da Vinci Code" is a thinking man's thriller...a knowledgeable suspense novel.Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon and French cryptologist Sophie Neveu team up when Sophie's grandfather (curator of the Louvre), is murdered.A breathless chase at a breakneck pace deciphering a combination of coded clues, hidden treasure, fascinating historical figures with a secret society link push the plot with a relentless beat-the-clock pressure.Empirical evidence and religious faith conflict leading you to jaw dropping conjectures. You will challenge all you discovered in school.Conspiracy theory buffs will love this book. Just when you think you know who are Langdon and Neveu's allies and enemies, you doubt your logic, change your mind and still remain unsure.Making "The Da Vinci Code" all the more enthralling is the knowledge that Priory of Sion and Opus Dei are real organizations.Attempt the "challenge" at ... You need not be a Mensa Society member to solve it, but it would speed the process.

There are no lawyers, judges, juries or DA's in "Bleachers" by John Grisham.It is a simple, unpretentious story eloquently told.The high school football team put a small Southern town on the map after a new coach was hired. Eddie Rake, the coach for 34 years won numerous state championships and had an eighty-four game winning streak.More important than the stats was the influence, inspiration and affect he had on his players. They were considered the elite, not only of the school, but the town as well.The coach is dying and players return for the vigil and funeral of the man they both loved and hated, revered and feared, adored and abhorred.Generations of players mingle, stories are swapped and long held secrets are revealed.A powerful book that will make you laugh, cry and cheer---and in the end feel uplifted and reaffirmed.You cannot ask for more than that.

With a complete suspension of disbelief this can be a pretty fun read. Give the author a lot of latitude in credulity department and enjoy. The two villainesses are almost cartoonish and stretch the imagination.This was my first &quot;Prey&quot; series read and I will take the advice of an earlier reviewer and read the initial entry. I liked Lucas Davenport and would like to fill in the blanks on him.The first hundred pages flew by and then it sputtered and sped up a couple of times. There was some great cop dialog and some interesting characters on Davenport's side of the law. Interesting twist on the cat and mouse genre.It's fun, but not too likely.

I can understand why all the awards and nominations on this first novel. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are wonderful LA characters. Mr. Crais paints vivid word pictures of LA and gets the reader involved with the players. Lots of action and loathsome bad guys. Having read three others in the Elvis Cole series I was familiar with the backgrounds of Cole and Pike...and I feel that kept me better prepared for some of the twists. Michael Connelly remains the premier mystery novelist to me, but Robert Crais is certainly adding quality to the genre. Looking forward to more of this most enjoyable series.

I was drawn to this one because it won an Edgar for Best First Novel. As a James Patterson fan I went in ready to be bowled over. While not my favorite from Mr. Patterson, this is a satisfying read. Certainly worthwhile just to get the history of his writings.Like everything I have read from Mr. Patterson, this one read extremely fast. It took me a little while to put faces on the main characters, and I am not certain that I was 100% successful in that task. I got to know them pretty well, and found the plot set up most engaging...it kept me on my toes.Somehow &quot;The Thomas Berryman Number&quot; had a feel somewhat like &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot;---at least to me. It certainly had me turning pages.I have to recommend reading this one if you are a James Patterson fan. It takes little time due to his flowing writing style, and give you a sense of where he started. Surely I plan to get a hold of more of his earlier works. Mr. Patterson gets your attention and moves the story at a good pace.

Barry Levinson's "Sixty-Six" is a marvelous paean to friendship, male bonding and Baltimore---perhaps "Son of Diner."At least somewhat autobiographical, narrator Bobby Shine guides the reader thru the lives of a group that hangs at the Hilltop Diner. In their early twenties, they cling to their past as they move into adulthood and responsibility.Against a background of change, the crew segues from the fifties rituals to the uncertainty of the sixties. The cultural landscape is shifting and the friends are caught up in the unexpected changes.The story is replete with wonderful digressions to past events that forged their camaraderie. It is told in a relaxed conversational style with magnificent dialogue full of wit, irony, sarcasm and humor. You feel like you are sitting in the diner with them.Filled with elation and melancholy, laughter and tears, opportunities lost and found, "Sixty-Six" is both funny and sad---and always poignant.

"Beyond Recognition" by Ridley Pearson accelerates from the first page, and with the exception of a lull at the midway point moves at a nonstop pace.The lull is caused by a couple of scenes being too drawn out and what I felt a weaker subplot.The story is riveting when the action revolves around the investigation of the Seattle serial arsonist and the interaction between Lou Boldt, Daphne Matthews and their team. The characters (on both sides of the law) are well developed and most credible.Mr. Pearson did a couple of years of research on this one and it shows. It is based on an actual Seattle arson case and the procedural and technical aspects really ring true.Seattle comes to life on every page with wonderful descriptive passages.This is a terrific series and Mr. Pearson is masterful at forensic detail, without making it tedious. Highly recommended.

Steve Hamilton's "Cold Day in Paradise" won the Edgar as Best First Novel---I can see why. It completely captured me.It is a tightly written, unpredictable, chilling, quick paced plot. He has a fresh approach to the troubled excop turned detective genre and some witty writing.Mr. Hamilton has created an intriguing protagonist aided by some good supporting characters.The noirish plot kept me guessing all the way with plenty of tension. In fact I guessed who was behind the plot early on, only to reject my deduction. Good twists and turns.All in all a solid, involving debut novel. I will be catching up on this four book series in short order.

Floridian Florence Horvath's body washes ashore in the harbor of Paradise, Massachusetts to open up Robert B. Parker's fifth Jesse Stone novel, "Sea Change."The town is jammed with yacht and sailboat racing fans, partiers and participants.Paradise's Race Week, ironically lasts an entire month giving Police Chief Stone plenty of time to ferret out the person or persons responsible for Florence's death.The chief is a former burned out LA cop, highly qualified, extremely motivated and enjoying his new surroundings. His staff is experienced and competent...and he can count on the Captain of the State Police to supply what his office lacks.Florence liked kinky sex and video tapes and that revelation leads Stone to any number of suspects who are all "guilty of something." The two prime suspects are at least good for statutory rape. The strange combination of money and corruption is a key to the clarification of the murder.Florence's daffy twin sisters arrive on the scene and muddy the waters...but through an excellent Ft. Lauderdale detective Stone pieces the fragments of the puzzle into a complete picture.Fast paced, written in a simple and tight prose with a succinct plot, this could be the best entry thus far in the Jesse Stone series.A most entertaining weekend read!

Since this was my first Patricia Cornwell, I had neither any Kay Scarpetta history nor expectations. So I rather enjoyed this one.It has a sense of the Carl Hiaasen/Laurence Shames humor and is an entertaining read. It has a light hearted, ironic and quirky approach. There is also action and movement.Both the good and bad guys have comedic sides and all manage to have their stumbles...the bad guys more so.This novel is what it is, and if not taken too seriously it is a fast, fun, quick read...it's escapism.And for those disappointed not to have a Kay Scarpetta, just think how well refreshed her character will be with this interlude.

"Mystic River" is equally as haunting and intense on the second read, as it was the first time. Dennis Lehane places you right in the middle of the Boston working class neighborhood.It is a powerful, gritty, superior work of crime fiction---urban noir at its finest.Honor, violence, guilt, trauma of youth and revenge frame the story line---and the plot twists are revelations of character.Violence split three friends apart, and it is violence that reunites them over twenty years later. The violence is both physical and psychic. The violence and vengeance have unintended consequences.The characters are complex, enigmatic, ambiguous, perplexing and steeped in Catholic guilt. They come alive from page one with all their flaws, anguish, torment and personal demons.The whodunit is cleverly resolved, but "Mystic River" is much more than just a mystery story. Mr. Lehane takes you into the individual minds and souls of the players. You experience their pain, know their motivations as well as their flaws and choices."Mystic River" is unforgettable and is etched in my mind.

I do not know what I can add that has not already been said about the terrific work except: if you read only one book this year, make it &quot;Mystic River.&quot;It is noir and hardboiled with a touch of darkness. I was seduced from page one.It centers around three imperfect men in imperfect situations where each one tries to be less than imperfect in their individual approaches to a solution.The journey from the setup in their youth to the resolution thirty years later is enthralling.The story flows without pause. The characters, their environment and families are fully developed. The whodunit aspect is spectacular in its completeness and logic. Mr. Lehane keeps you changing your mind as you attempt to add up the clues to arrive at a solution.I admit that I came late to the Dennis Lehane party only last year with &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; and &quot;Sacred.&quot; He is a consistent writer, and the good news about my belated discovery is that I still have two Lehanes to read this year.&quot;Mystic River&quot; would make a great movie. I see Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the three principles.

I reread &quot;Hart's War&quot; prior to seeing the movie version. It is just as riveting, intense, dramatic and compelling as it was when I first read it in 1999.The characters truly come alive on the pages, and the pages absolutely fly by. The story unfolds in a logical and orderly fashion. The pacing is never forced.The reader can feel the frustration, boredom and exasperation experienced by the POW's in Stalag 13. The conditions they existed under and lack of qualified doctors were truly horrendous.The protagonist, Tommy Hart, is thrust into a situation he is unprepared for. His resourcefulness leads him to two allies in the British side of the POW camp. This trio gets some assistance from some unlikely sources.As the book progresses, Tommy Hart finds people working against him on both the German and American sides. Realizing all is not as it seems, he is forced to rely on his own ingenuity.In short, it is the triumph of an ordinary man acting in an extraordinary manner in an almost impossible situation.It is an extremely powerful book with a moving ending.This is a hard book for a movie to live up to.

Here's one that lives up to it's hype. I am not sure if this is the best book I have read this year, but I suspect it is. What I certain of, is that it is easily the most powerful book I have read thus far in 1999. Wonderfully deep characters, twists and turns that offer constant surprises, clear writing. After you live the lives of the main characters, the final chapter is especially moving. John Katzenbach is a marvelous writer. I know two of his novels have been made into movies. It would be great to see &quot;Hart's War&quot; make it to film.

"Soul Circus" is the darkest and most complicated in the Derek Strange series by George Pelecanos. There are fewer pop culture references as you experience the violence of the inner city."Soul Circus" is a western set in the part of D.C. "rarely seen by commuters and generally ignored by the press, out of sight and easily forgotten." PI's Derek Strange and Terry Quinn are lawmen in a lawless society.Dialogue driven, full of vivid cultural realism, it is an intense story of the urban battlefield...not a whodunit, but rather a haunting crime novel with all the collateral damage and unintended consequences.In the midst of a looming gang war between rival drug lords, Strange is driven by a complex moral anger, as he feels inadvertently responsible for a murder.The interconnection of the subplots is profound. Mr. Pelecanos does have an agenda, but he integrates it seamlessly into the story without preaching.The reality is truly disturbing, but it is skillfully written and a compelling read.Not for the sqeamish...highly recommended!

To me, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; was easily the best book I read in 1994. Since then my anticipation for the follow up was high. I was thrilled when I saw &quot;Day of Confession&quot; was out. Another complex plot filled with well defined characters. You can really loathe the evil doers, cheer unashamedly for the good guys and feel sad when a good guy dies. As with &quot;Tomorrow&quot; the reader has to suspend disbelief a number of times...but isn't that part of what fiction is all about? Things move rapidly and you can find yourself knocking off over 100 pages at a sitting. Mr. Folsom certainly helped the reader this time by providing a list of the characters with a one line descriptions. This is a welcome aid until the characters flesh out. It was a fine read, resolved well. It lacked the knockout punch delived at the end of his &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot;.

After reading the book I can understand the disparity in the customer reviews. &quot;State of Mind&quot; was a disappointment to me as I found Mr. Katzenbach's &quot;Hart's War&quot; &amp; &quot;Shadowman&quot; among the best books I have ever read. Parts of &quot;State of Mind&quot; just flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction. Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again.

Two years ago I plodded thru his &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; and it just did not electrify me. All the feedback put me in the vast minority.Now after reading &quot;Sacred&quot; in one day I understand why Mr. Lehane is getting raves.This is a momentum book...a bit slow developing, but about a third of the way thru it picks up speed and goes nonstop to the ending. The conclusion does require a major suspension of disbelief, but that does not diminish the chase. For me, the payoff was the chase rather than the finale.The red herrings and misdirections kept me guessing and turning the pages. The building action was such that Mr. Lehane left me hanging at the end of a chapter, forcing me to read &quot;just one more chapter&quot;...and then one more etc. Just three sittings to complete &quot;Sacred.&quot;As a Floridian I particularly enjoyed the scenes in the Tampa Bay area. That made me wonder if the Florida setting made the difference in my enjoyment of Mr. Lehane. I will sample another of his works shortly to see if it is the author or simply the book that won me over. I hope it's the former as it would be wonderful to have another writer whose books are impossible to put down.

"Dark Horse" was the first Tami Hoag novel I have read---and I will be back for more.It is deeply plotted and richly written. The characters are well defined. You get to know them all extremely well.It is written in the first person. That allows the reader to learn plot point before the protagonist (ex cop Elena Estes.)Elena was let go from the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office after her aggressive action on a bust got a fellow cop killed. So, she has her demons to wrestle and begins the healing process of personal redemption in a kidnapping case.There are enough twists and turns and false leads that at one time or another I was certain of whodunit and was wrong on all occasions. Great deceptions.It is a great thriller set in the world of competitive horse jumping and dressage. I have zero interest in those equestrian sports, but the book is so well written I could not put it down. A solid "Bee Plus."

Do not miss Nelson DeMille's "Night Fall" if fast-pacing, witty dialogue, surprising turns and sophisticated writing wrapped around a conspiracy theory is your cup of tea.Former NYPD detective John Cory returns. He is now a contract employee for the Anti Terrorism Task Force. Corey is cynical, sarcastic, politically incorrect, self-deprecating, street smart and anti-authority...my type of guy.Corey's wife, Kate Mayfield (FBI lawyer on the same task force) takes him to a memorial service for the fifth anniversary of the crash of TWA Flight 800.Corey and Kate are convinced the government arrived at their conclusion too quickly and too conveniently. Corey, always concerned with justice, sets off on his own renegade investigation.A particularly arrogant senior FBI agent warns Kate and Corey not to question the official version. That ensures that Corey will be relentless in his pursuit of the truth.Any more would give away too much of this muscular thriller.

A friend tipped me off to WEB Griffin and I started off with his &quot;Men At War&quot; series, but out of order. This being the kickoff to the series, it came up as my second read.Therefore, it was most interesting to get the complete back-story on the principle fictional characters. It certainly puts a more proper perspective on chapter two (&quot;Secret Warriorts&quot;).I particularly enjoyed the mixing of actual events and real people from the WWII era with the fictional characters. It gives a greater feeling of reality and you feel part of the action.The series revolves around the founding and early days of the OSS...and our quest to beat the Axis powers in the race to develop the Atomic Bomb. Here we experience the setup to covertly attain the uranium necessary to complete the task.The primary fictional characters are remarkably portrayed in a way that would make Errol Flynn, John Wayne and Tyrone Power proud. The action and plot flow smoothly and the book is great fun.The characters are truly well developed and you feel an intimacy with many of them. You want them to show up in the next book in the series. Mr. Griffin does a good job of getting you to care about the players and to cheer for them all the way.I am thankful to my friend for this recommendation and plan to read plenty more WEB Griffin.

I saw James Patterson at a symposium sponsored by the Broward County (Fla.) Public Library Foundation on 3/4/00. He shared a panel with Michael Connelly entitled &quot;Beyond Crime and Punishment.&quot; I started &quot;Midnight Club&quot; after the panel and finished it the next day. It gave new meaning to the term page turner. Great story and characters made me willingly suspend my disbelief.

At best, a Cee Minus for David Baldacci's "Hour Game."It starts out promising with the return of ex-Secret Service agents turned PIs, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell.They were terrific in "Split Second" and still have some savoir-faire.However they are placed in a bloated plot that is filled with one contrivance after another. Even I do not possess the ability to suspend my disbelief this much.Ludicrous situations and resolutions abound. When, in a shootout, the two bullets collide---well, you almost lose your sanity.If you like thrillers that offer sound reasoning, elan, plausibility or profoundness this is not for you.It wins this quarter's James Patterson Pathetic Thriller Sweepstake.He phoned it in.

While Joseph Finder's "Paranoia" is a formulaic thriller (complete with a hard to buy premise), populated with stock characters, needless cliches and many too many lucky coincidences, I could not help but enjoy it.It is pop culture eye candy...an easy reading Silicon Valley techno-espionage plot with built in momentum.Underachiever deluxe, Adam Cassidy is forced into going to work for his employer's biggest rival as a corporate mole.Adam is placed in the midst of a dangerous maze on his double-dealing mission filled with encrypted messages, blind drops and key tracking devices. Naturally his peculiar sense of justice kicks in as he finds "a home" at his new company."Paranoia" provides an interesting and wickedly amusing look at corporate culture from the cube farms to the executive conference rooms...and the high-tech shoptalk and buzzword lend credibility.In fact, Adam's voice, outlook and situation will captivate anyone who has been a wage slave.Like the John Grisham novels, Adam is a naive and ambitious young guy enticed by temptation...and we observe how he comes to terms with it.A harmless diversion...it is fun while it lasts, but leaves no lasting impression.

P.J. Parrish's "Dark of the Moon" is a captivating debut novel---the first in the Louis Kincaid series.It is 1983 and Louis returns to Black Pool, Mississippi from Detroit to care for his dying mother. He stays in law enforcement as an investigator for the BPSD.Louis discovers the thirty-year-old remains of a lynched black man. Much like Harry Bosch, Louis feels the need to speak for the dead---he wants to ID the body.The local white trash, insular policos with vested interests and powerful families want the past to remain in the past. There are obviously secrets to be protected in this small southern town.Louis has only two slim clues, an ally with the FBI in Jackson, and an unknown collaborator feeding him info bit by bit. A couple of murders suggest that the secrets will remained silent.Will these present day murders lead Louis to the solution of the lynching and the person(s) responsible for the cover-up?As the odds against Louis locating the answers mount he shows more resolve in getting to the truth. He refuses to back off---his deep sense of honor and integrity eventually winning over some in the Sheriff's Department.Intricately plotted, a strong cast, believable dialogue and creditable resolution combine to make this one a keeper. This is a wonderful series with a protagonist to cheer for.

"Stone Cold", the fourth Jesse Stone novel by Robert B. Parker is breezy, fun, fast and entertaining.Parallel plots have small town police chief Jesse Stone attempting to solve a high profile serial killer case as well as a high school gang rape.The killers are Mensa types---truly diabolical and contemptible. Good solid police work by the overtaxed police force is carefully utilized to uncover the killers. The plot thickens when Jesse is certain of their identity, but lacks the hard proof necessary for arrest.The rape case is trickier. They know whodunit, however the victim and her parents are reluctant to testify or accuse the preps. So, subtlety, finesse and undercover work are employed to dupe the suspects into turning on each other. Very cleverly done!The running subplot involves Jesse's ambiguous relationship with his ex-wife enhances the story line, as we learn more about Jesse the individual as well as the cop.The lean Parker writing style makes the pages disappear. Snappy dialogue, absorbing good guys and bad guys, spare prose create a highly pleasurable read.

Easy to read and most enjoyable. Robert Crais has created a most interesting PI with many wonderful quirks and a great sense of right and wrong. Love the wisecracks and asides that are a big part of the Elvis Cole persona.Colorful characters populate this one: a conterfeiter in the witness protection program, the Russian Mafia, Vietnamese revolutionaries, the Feds (some with dubious qualities) as Elvis and Pike attempt to reunite the counterfeiter with his three children.No problem to follow, good pacing, a good surprise at the end, a satisfying conclusion and just plain hard to put down.This is an extraordinary series with a certain noir quality that would translate well to film, especially if played like the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series.

In 1987's "Under Cover of Daylight" James W. Hall introduces Thorn, the nonconformist antihero, and reveals his troubled past.It is a believable suspenseful story of secrets, revenge, personal loss and an elaborate land grab scheme.A drunken driver who escaped conviction killed Thorn's parents.At age nineteen, Thorn avenges their death.Twenty years later, living in the Keys---life seems good for Thorn. His hand made bone fish flies are in huge demand---there is plenty of time for Thorn and his friend Sugarman to enjoy the Keys lifestyle---and prosecuting attorney Sarah Ryan has entered his life.And then---a psycho hired killer murders Thorn's adoptive mother (who actively opposes the condo developers). Once again Thorn is compelled to find justice on his terms.This is a dynamic debut novel. All the characters are richly drawn; the Keys come vividly to life, the plot races along and the resolution is most satisfying."Under Cover of Daylight" is a most worthy reread for all fans of James W. Hall and Thorn.

As an Edna Buchanan and Britt Montero fan I was filled with immense disappointment after reading this one. &quot;Garden of Evil&quot; required more suspension of disbelief than I am capable of. And, Britt's photographer friend at &quot;The News&quot; has become one very annoying character. James Lee Burke and Clive Cussler have proven that a continuing character can get stale and become a parody of itself. It may be time for Edna Buchanan to give Britt a rest and during the pause give us a new protagonist. Then Britt can return refreshed, much like James Robicheaux and Dirk Pitt have after interludes by their authors. Michale Connelly has broken up his Harry Bosch series three times, and that certainly looks like the right way to keep a character vibrant. Edna Buchanan has given us much much better about Miami (and Britt) and is capable of so much more. This is not up to the usual high Buchanan standard.

Harry Bosch has become one of crime fiction's most fleshed-out characters...and he keeps improving with each novel Michael Connelly writes. Mr. Connelly is a modern master.Harry has returned to the LAPD, repartnered with Kiz Rider in the recently created Open Unsolved Unit. He remains a relentless, smart, hard working, compassionate, fundamentally decent detective. He is a complicated character---still seeking justice.Harry and Kiz draw a case from 1988...the murder of an eighteen year biracial girl. DNA is available from the murder weapon...and they get an immediate match.They both feel there are enough inconsistencies in the match's history to question whether he is the perp.As they work the case they uncover the crime's heartbreaking effects for the victim's family. These unsolved mysteries can haunt a department...often defining the police force that cannot resolve them.Even with the tools unavailable in 1988, it still takes dogged legwork, cop's instinct and long grinding hours to decipher the case. This is where Michael Connelly excels...the calculated progress of Police Procedure 101.The suspense is constant; surprises appear at every turn, the entire cast vibrant in this taut crime thriller. "The Closers" is well executed and well envisioned.The plot builds in a deceptive manner...accelerating geometrically as the novel progresses. It ignites in a hushed manner...propelling you to the resolution.Mr. Connelly is most adept at setting the hook in a most subtle manner...he hides the clues in plain sight as well as any writer. He makes discovering the solution completely satisfying.It is easy to immerse oneself in "The Closers."

Two thumbs up for "Turning Angel" by Greg Iles.Prosecutor/novelist Penn Cage returns from my favorite Iles book, "The Quiet Game" as the protagonist.Penn has left the legal life to spend time with his daughter in his hometown of Natchez. And, he has renewed his boyhood friendship with Dr. Drew Elliot, a prominent member of the Natchez gentry.Both are attending a board meeting of the elite private school, St. Stephens Prep when the meeting is interrupted with news that star senior student on her way to Harvard (Kate Townsend) has been found murdered.Kate was the poster child for perfection. However, the investigation shows Kate was buying drugs from an infamous dealer, posing for kinky photos and having an affair with a married man (Dr. Drew Elliot).Dr. Elliot informs Penn of the affair, claim innocence in the murder and gets Penn back into the legal game to defend him. The price of defending his friend could affect Penn's run for mayor and makes him a target for the real killer.There is no shortage of homegrown suspects as well as a few outsiders and a particularly venal blackmailer.It is a fast moving plot with a rapid pulse. The reader is enveloped by the conspiracies and small town intrigue. There is ample action as we learn just who did what to whom, and why.

I will refrain from using lots of sports cliches to describe this book...but the temptation is there.This is very good collection of mystery writers and (for reasons I fail to grasp) Mike Lupica. I have read the works of over half the authors and a big fan of some of them.The book was a pleasant diversion from the normal selection of mysteries and thrillers I read...especially as the major league season winds down.Most of the stories were quick reads with a couple of surprise endings. Short stories are a different way to enjoy a writer when you are used to the whole novel. It was amazing to see how well some of these novelists could develop characters and plot in such a short format.I found the stories by Michael Connelly, Laura Lippman, Elmore Leonard, Henry Slesar, Troy Soos and Robert Parker the best. Other than the Lupica the only other one that I found lacking was the one by K.C. Constantine.

James W. Hall has set the bar very high for mystery/thrillers coming out this year with "Forests of the Night."It is sophisticated suspense at the highest level...distinguished writing...powerful prose.The first rate story line is concise and examines corruption, wantonness and depravity in man. The villains are beyond salvation and vicious in the way they go about their hideous acts. The last time the criminal element was so chilling was in "Dirty White Boys" by Stephen Hunter. These thugs make your skin crawl and sleep with the light on...because you know they truly exist.The past and present collide...going back 160 years to a deathly pact made between the government and a Cherokee patriot over "The Trail of Tears."A present day descendent (Jacob Panther) swoops down upon a dedicated Coral Gables cop (Charlotte Monroe), her high profile lawyer husband and their schizophrenic teenaged daughter, altering the lives of all as the startling revelations unfold.Panther has assassinated a businessman in Miami and when he takes off for North Carolina, the daughter follows and aids his flight.The Monroes head to North Carolina and are confronted by evil incarnate in the form of a stonewalling sheriff; his father, a corrupt congressman and the congressman's reclusive brother.Their attempts to locate and rescue their daughter are challenged at every level.To say anymore would give away too much.The twists are magnificent and lead to a breath-taking finish.The villain's identity is divulged with about a hundred pages to go...and that only makes you turn the pages faster.

In Michael Crichton's "State of Fear" the narrative punch is derived from reality.His comprehensively thorough and meticulous bibliography and appendices back up the theories proposed in the novel.Dr. Crichton has done his homework.The extensive research (fastidiously footnoted) contradicts environmental concerns most people believe and fear, and casts those preoccupied about global warming as gullible pawns of Hollywood and environmentalists.While the bad guys in the novel are particularly odious, it is the PLM (politico-legal-media complex) that is the true villain. The PLM is the new military-industrial complex. The PLM promotes fear in the population under the appearance of promoting safety.Rouge members of a high profile environmental activist group (NERF) are set to manipulate and amplify a series of natural disasters to occur simultaneously with their massive media conference---allowing their prophesies to appear authentic.It is up to a ragtag band of scientists, a billionaire philanthropist and lawyers using a multitude of high tech toys to uncover the scheme. The brilliantly conceived ticking clock scenario bristles with clarity and plausibility.The articulate cast of protagonists leaps to life as the puzzle pieces lock into place and the chase is on."State of Fear" is a consistently exciting and suspenseful tale, as well as a serious thriller.After you finish "State of Fear" it becomes difficult to accept on faith much of what you will hear or read about global warming and other environmental catastrophes.

Steve Hamilton's third Alex McKnight novel, "The Hunting Wind" held me hostage from the opening paragraph. I could not put it down and finished it less than twenty-four hours later.Truly an absorbing mystery/thriller filled with intriguing characters, intricate subplots and riveting suspense.What starts out as a trackdown for an old friend turns into a sinister, tension filled adventure filled with deceit. Former cop (and reluctant P.I.) McKnight gets caught in the middle and learns to trust no one.Steve Hamilton is a fresh and refreshing voice who wastes no words and gives readers a believable protagonist surrounded by eccentric and engaging supporting characters.This is an phenomenal series...not to be missed.

Along with Hammett, Cain and Chandler, Ross Macdonald is a pioneer of the literate mystery novel.In "The Chill" (written in 1963), Lew Archer has a missing persons case that leads to three murders committed over a twenty year period that he must tie together.There is plenty of action, twists, reversals and suspense throughout...adultery, cons, frame-ups, blackmail.The plot is complicated and complex; filled with plentiful characters (many with aliases). You have to pay attention and keep score.The ending is a major surprise.It is easy to see why it is among the IMBA's "100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century."Well worth a second read.

The first 80% of Kam Majd's debut novel "High Wire" is nearly impossible to put down. The final 20% needs a suspension of disbelief equal to that of a James Bond movie. No matter, it is an entertaining ride.Essentially a techo-thriller featuring a ticking clock with a cat and mouse chase (the hunted hunting the hunters). Creatively written, filled with nonstop tension and shifting loyalties, it is easy to get hooked."High Wire" truly deserves its Edgar nomination.I liked the way Mr. Majd developed his characters. The protagonists are resourceful, the villains especially devious and their crime quite ingenious.Looking forward to more in this series.

Having plodded thru the past couple of Mr. Grisham's novel, it was jusst wonderful to once again get a page turner that took less two days to read. No way could I put this one downIt is hard to find what one would call the definitive all American good guy protagonist. It's a nice change of pace to cheer for the &quot;good guys&quot; who are in reality flawed neer-do-wells.While not quite noir characters, they have an occasional burst of a Damon Runyanesquelike charm. You cannot totally despise them as they attempt to beat the system.I found a high entertainment value throughout the book. It may have been short on the courtroom drama, but it was full of the type of action that grabbed me in &quot;The Client.&quot;This one was a treat.KVD

Andea Camilleri's Silvio Montalbano series has been best seller material in Europe for years----just recently translated for the U.S. market.Camilleri's reserved and nimble writing style loses nothing in translation.Montalbano is a highly respected, cultivated Sicilian police inspector.In "The Shape of Water," the body of a local, well-connected politico is discovered with his pants around his ankles in a rough area populated by hookers and drug dealers. Cause of death appears to be heart failure---the vic had a history of heart ailments.Montalbano's supervisors pressure him to do a swift signed, sealed and delivered natural causes ruling. Many little things bother the inspector---so he pursues the case.A generous amount of eccentric, off-center and droll characters abound----even the garbage men possess Ph.D.s.Montalbano is a heady, witty, subtle, cynical investigator; not the pistol packing, bare-knuckles type.It is an inventive, clever, smart police procedural with three follow-ups. I am glad I discovered them and look forward to the entire series.

"The Runaway Jury" is the thinking man's John Grisham. Like his "The Pelican Brief" and "A Time to Kill," it is complex and densely plotted.Both sides in a multimillion-dollar tobacco suit have monitored all the potential jurors and chosen what they think are the most favorable twelve. But, you can never be 100% certain.With stakes this high neither side is against manipulating the jury---pressure, cajoling, and bribery all appear to be fair game. Every jury finds a leader---on this jury the leader (Nicholas Easter) has schemed to get on and has a cunning accomplice (Marlee) on the outside. They have an agenda, are well financed and very motivated---and are characters shrouded in mystery.The unfolding story line is how the plaintiff, defense and the inside man attempt to exploit the jury to their end. The characters are positively three-dimensional. The jurors' backgrounds, motivations, failings and vulnerabilities are brought to life without tedious detail.There are no absolutely good guys---the members of the defense are particularly despicable. Their venture to unearth the background on Nicholas and Marlee is terrific cat and mouse and a substantial subplot.The jury tampering, background chase and trial meld into a riveting conclusion.A terrific ride and satisfying finale.

T. Jefferson Parker is a member of the LA crime writer's elite. Like Michael Connelly and Robert Crais, he advances the mystery genre. In addition, he has won a pair of Edgars for Best Novel."The Fallen" is the equal of anything he has written.San Diego PD officer Robbie Brownlaw races into a burning building to rescue people. He runs into a crazed arsonist, who tosses Robbie out the window.An awning breaks his fall, he survives---but the trauma leaves him with synesthesia, a neurological condition that jumbles the senses.In Robbie's case he can see people's emotions when they speak...red squares means they are lying. Pretty handy for a cop.Rather than use this affliction as a gimmick for the novel, T. Jefferson gives us a timeless police procedural and a tough-minded portrait of big city crime and corruption.Robbie and his hard-edged partner McKenzie Cortez catch the case of ex-cop Garrett Asplundh who had transferred to the San Diego Ethics Authority.Garrett was clean as a whistle and in the middle of an inquiry into a prostitution ring with political connections. Is his murder linked to the sex videos provided to Garrett by a disgruntled call girl, municipal bond ratings and corrupt city and law enforcement officials?There is no shortage of people who would benefit if Garrett's investigation was halted. Brownlaw and Cortez must also consider the possibility that Garrett was killed because of something in his complex personal life.T. Jeff keeps us guessing who killed the man and why with a bundle of narrative thread twists."The Fallen" shows the never-ending clashes between different types of power and the corruption and financial shenanigans in "America's Finest City." Lovers, cops, whores, politicians are all fighting for power.Serious crime fiction...intelligent, stylish and insightful. First rate in every way.

"I'm learning more and more about less and less. Pretty soon, I'll know everything about nothing." So says Spenser about midway through "School Days" by Roberts B. Parker.This is a thoroughly enjoyable entry in the prolific Mr. Parker's long running series featuring the wisecracking, sardonic and resourceful Boston PI.The tedious, whiney, monotonous Susan is away at a shrink confab at Duke, so we are spared her overbearing, insufferable scenes.Hawk is also missing, so Spenser is flying solo when he is hired by the wealthy grandmother of one of two accused private school student shooters.The crime left seven dead and others wounded.Spenser feels something is amiss when it seems everyone from the boy's parents, the local cops, the school officials to the kid's lawyer all want to rubber stamp the allegations and see the boy (Jared Clark) behind bars. It appears someone wants something hidden.The more they stonewall him the more he snoops around.He upsets a myriad of people as he endeavors to learn how two seventeen year kids could acquire four new semiautomatic pistols and learn to shoot so efficiently.The journey to find the cause and those responsible for igniting the teens to such violence is imaginative and always interesting.Spenser's laconic banter is always dry and filled with irony...and the New England atmosphere comes electrically to life.This one is lotsa fun.

It is easy to see why Stephen J. Clark&#65533;s &#65533;Southern Latitudes&#65533; is nominated for a Best First Novel Edgar. It is a most compelling novel that I finished in less than a day.Ne&#65533;er do well burn out Nelson Ingram returns to his small-town Alabama home, finding work at the local paper covering rotary meetings and the like.The autopsy of an apparent KKK lynching shows the vic was shot in the head at close range, leading Nelson on a quest to find out why the entire town is looking the other way. Three related murders are uncovered and by putting the pieces together, Nelson&#65533;s life is endangered.Finally finding something he cares about, Nelson exposes the true villains and gains his redemption in the Southern Gothic tradition&#65533;where not everyone lives happily ever after.First class writing and major league plotting in this spellbinding debut. Hope it is the start of a series.

"Gone For Good" by Harlan Coben is spectacular. An ingenuous fast-paced plot full of numerous deceptions, double identities, misplaced faith and countless twists and turns.There are surprises every chapter, making it almost impossible to put down until you've read "just one more chapter."Mr. Coben does not just throw the reader an occasional curve---he throws sliders and change-ups as well, misdirecting the reader in a myriad of ways.Protagonist Will Klein's life is unraveling after he learns his brother (thought dead for eleven years) is alive and part of a sinister conspiracy.No one, from family, friends and enemies is who they appear to be."Gone For Gone" is engrossing suspense that is unpredictable. You may sleep with the light on after reading this one. A Plus.

This one flew as I finished it in only three sittings.The action never stopped. The players were most realistic and it was easy to get involved with all of them.Cat and mouse kept me on edge of my seat. The twists and turns and red herrings made it impossible to put down.The characters were well drawn and I will go back and read his earlier books. The ending was spectacular and what a surprise. The resolution leaves plenty of room for continuation of these characters and I look forward to a follow up.This is a thriller drama at its best.

Most authors express the belief that the short story is the most difficult format to execute. Developing characters and advancing plot(s) in the space limitations can tax the most gifted of writers.Leave it to Robert Randisi to assemble a collection of fascinating short mysteries with a jazz theme that belie the conventional wisdom.His "Murder and All That Jazz" boasts a roster filled with Edgar, Shamus and Agatha winners.The baker's dozen tales all sparkle...my particular favorites were penned by Laura Lippman, Les Roberts, Michael Connelly, Julie Smith and Mr. Randisi.A pleasure from start to finish. Enjoy this one and get an introduction to some writers you may not have known.

In "Dirty Work", the ninth in the cop turned lawyer Stone Barrington series by Stuart Woods, Stone stays close to home...no gallivanting to jet set hot spots.Stone is assigned by the Woodman & Weld law firm (where he is of counsel) to get proof of an unfaithful husband. Seemingly routine, this assignment leads Stone into the murky world espionage going back to murders (assassinations)at least a decade old.In this domain, the "good guys" are treacherous and the "bad guys" earn your compassion...and a deadly female assassin bent on revenge appears far more sympathetic than the MI-5 agent hunting her.Mr. Woods has crafted another entertaining Stone Barrington installment with lots of sex appeal, intriguing plot and subplots with not a word wasted. The story moves at a lightning pace.Stone's former cop partner Dino is prominent throughout and remains one of fiction's strongest supporting characters.As always, Stone is a captivating, engaging, witty bon vivant with enough panache for a dozen men. Easy to enjoy without requiring a lot of time.

In Steve Hamilton's fourth novel, "North of Nowhere", reluctant PI Alex McKnight continues to become entangled in problems not of his making that compel him back into the detective game. Fate leads Alex to a poker game that ends up in a robbery.While robbery, Canadian organized crime, loan sharking and smuggling engulf Michigan's UP, the ultimate story is about McKnight helping his pal Jackie...human frailties and passions are central to the story.Mr. Hamilton's poetic hard-edged prose rings true as lead after lead never add up for McKnight.The intricate plot has plenty of twists to keep you guessing...nothing is straight forward as events spin out of control.The cast that supports McKnight is powerful and grows in each installment.So whether you prefer plot over characters, or vice versa, this series will hook you.

Daniel Silva has yet to disappoint me. The action revolves around the Arab/PLO/Jewish conflict. As novels about that political situation are of little interest to me (my preference is the USA hardboiled detective), it takes an extraordinary tale to captivate me the way &quot;The Kill Artist&quot; did.As with Mr. Silva's other novels, I could not put it down. It's one of those books you steal time for. The pages fly by.The characters are richly portrayed and fairly complex. You get to know all of them. On both sides, the major players are flawed, and the reader must decide who truly wears the white hat. So much evil has been perpetuated on both sides...there is plenty of blame to spread around.Excellent cat and mouse plotting. Great attention to detail in the spy versus spy aspect and the physical settings.While it gets a bit muddy at the very end, I applaud this one and highly endorse it to those readers who are fascinated by thrillers that do not stretch credulity and place you as a reader in the middle of the action.Mr. Silva is an excellent story teller, who does his homework.

"Over Tumbled Graves" by Jess Walter is an exquisite, thought-provoking first novel.It is a story of conflict, contrast and choice set amidst a serial killer investigation in Spokane.A drug bust gone awry leads to the discovery of a string of hooker killings, all with an identical signature.Spokane's Major Crime Unit's initial suspect is linked to two brutal non-serial murders as well. The more they learn about him, the more intangible he becomes.The characters are complicated, believable, motivated---their internal dialogue and tensions fueling the plot. Alan Dupree's cynical, sarcastic, acidic wit is a highlight.Competing "celebrity" profilers, the attendant media circus, condescending FBI "assistance" and a mid-investigation change of lead detectives distract and surround the investigation.In the end, it is the Spokane MCU's detailed, tedious, credible investigative work ethic that corners the perp. That final answer is unexpected and complex.A lack of cardboard stereotypes, superb misdirection and smoothly flowing action earn "Over Tumbled Graves" highly recommended status.

Everything that occurs in "The Night Gardener" by George Pelecanos has a consequence and affects the perspective of the novel's multitude of characters.Washington D.C. is a major character...not the city seen by tourists, politicos and lobbyists...rather the city where the murder of a drug dealer is known as a "society cleanse." Mr. Pelecanos transports the reader to this authentic and shocking kingdom of street crime.At the core of the story are three D.C. cops and the cases that trigger their lives to intersect.In 1985, T.C. Cook was a legend in the homicide division, while Gus Ramone and Dan "Doc" Holiday were rookie beat cops.Cook was lead detective on a serial murder case involving three teens who were murdered in various city community gardens. The cases were never closed...the killings stopped.In 2005, Cook has retired and had a stroke...Doc Holiday has a limo service (he left the force just before an internal affairs investigation)...Gus Ramone is a solid family man and homicide Detective Sgt.The three are reunited while trying to solve a present day killing with possible links to the three unsolved from 1985 that continue to haunt them.The three have separate motives. Solving the case would mean redemption for the alcoholic Holiday. For Cook, apprehending the killer will end his obsession so he can rest in peace. For Ramone, it is all part of the job...and it is personal, as his fourteen-year-old son knew the 2005 victim.This is a panoramic novel, with a sizeable cast amid a tangle of subplots. The reader immediately becomes caught up in the sequence of events and Mr. Pelecanos challenges you to pay attention. And, the rewards are great.More a novel about crime than a crime novel per se, you will become more interested in learning how the case will alter the lives of the trio of cops than how they will solve the crime."The Night Gardener" is a compelling and powerful novel whose characters come alive via revealing details. The absorbing plot of parallel stories of working cops and career criminals will lead you in unexpected directions.To detail any more of the story line would deprive readers of the shock of discovery.At the conclusion, you may feel the need for a standing ovation.

I like Ed McBain's Mathew Hope series. While not as complicated, noir or hardboiled as the 87th Precinct novels, they are great fun and witty.This one was almost a short story. Good workable plot, a couple interesting sidebars, enjoyable characters and a resolution you can accept.The Florida scene is well set in the fictitious city of Calussa with a couple of Miami excursions. Mathew Hope is an interesting protagonist...a lawyer with a heart of gold willing to be a private eye for his client as well.It's fast, easy and entertaining.

This one was a struggle for me. I never felt like I got to know any of the characters, and thought there were too many of them. The whodoneit was never clearly defined for me. I could not assuredly decide what crime was being solved. It just failed to explode for me. Since it won both an Anthony and Shamus award in 1997 I will give his &quot;Widower's Two Step&quot; a shot later this summer. It got nominated for an Anthony and Shamus and won an Edgar. The setting of the scenes and the Texas atmosphere were well done, but the dialog and characters escaped me. I would rather read James Lee Burke or Robert Crais.

&quot;Dirty White Boys&quot; was my initial Stephen Hunter read. I then went back and started chronologically. By the time I got to &quot;Point of Impact&quot; I trusted Mr. Hunter. Therefore I did not get distressed with the arcane and detailed info on rifles, ballistics, shooting etc. that began &quot;Point of Impact&quot;. I was rewarded with a wonderfully rich character in Bob Lee Swagger. &quot;Time to Hunt&quot; completes the Swagger trilogy. Again, rich characters whose flaws make them oh so real and compassionate. It is a thriller of the nth degree. As in the previous Swagger stories the true villan is in doubt until the final pages. Then you have to go back and reread the last half dozen or so pages, just to make certain you read it correctly. Mr. Hunter writes with conviction and makes you find time to drop what you should be doing and get back to his book

It's easy to understand why it has an Edgar nomination. This is a most suspensful novel with strong characters. Easily the longest and deepest Elvis Cole novel to date. This time it's Elvis who is the archangel, as he looks to clear his partner Joe Pike. We also get the backstory on Pike, a welcome treat. This is one great series and Mr. Crais has truly made Elvis Cole and Joe Pike richer characters as the series extends.

With "The Camel Club," David Baldacci keeps the plots churning with his tale of four elderly, unconventional gentlemen of assorted backgrounds whose Camel Club is a "conspiracy watchdog group."They hold no power...their objective is to learn the "truth" behind the exploits of the US government.Their leader has no acknowledged past and calls himself (with a touch of irony) Oliver Stone.The four witness a gruesome murder and their hunt for the perps leads them on a path where the truth gets hazier with each clue and each new double cross...and could lead right to the Oval Office.A Secret Service agent who is three years shy of retirement becomes an unexpected ally after being warned off by his superiors.The amount of suspension of disbelief needed depends on how effortlessly you embrace conspiracy theories. Myself, I have yet to meet a conspiracy theory I couldn't buy."The Camel Club" demands your attention and captures your imagination. It is certain to keep you engaged.

Not being able to put down a Robert Crais novel is becoming a habit with me. This is a most intriguing &quot;stand alone&quot; from man who has given us the wonderful PI, Elvis Cole. This break in the Elvis Cole action is certain to bring us a refreshed Elvis.Meanwhile &quot;Demolition Angel&quot; grabbed me from page one and did not let go. It was difficult to work up a liking for the protagonist (Carol Starky) at first, but she seemed to become less abrasive (without losing her edginess) as the book moved along. By the end I was cheering her every inch of the way.Surrounded by her own demons, a rogue ATF agent, a skeptical boss, a cop gone bad, a serial bomber and assorted other allies and enemies, Mr. Crais has given the reader a wonderful supporting cast.Intricate plot twists, a believable chain of events and a satisfying resolution all combine to make a most enjoyable read.

Vince Flynn is as fine a thriller writer as there is today. His prescient "Memorial Day" is an incredibly detailed and persuasive novel on the CIA's counter-terrorism war.CIA counter-terrorism agent/assassin Mitch Rapp leads a highly successful lightning raid into Pakistan that uncovers an al Qaeda nuclear plot.Using a combination of non-politically correct methods on the captured, Rapp extracts info stating that within seven days attacks will be launched against the president, his cabinet, armed forces leaders and foreign dignitaries.Rapp is the CIA's "Dirty Harry" with no time for due process. However he must overcome colliding egos, agendas, political philosophies in high places while leading the effort to thwart the attacks.Vacillating politicos, obstructionist presidential sycophants and an ambitious liberal civil rights lawyer are just as bothersome to Rapp's undertaking as are the al Qaeda.Rapp is a fascinating character full of contradictions; capable of non-emotional violence and possessing admirable patriotism.The plot packs a real kick, is full of surprises and populated with well-drawn characters.Mr. Flynn distinguishes between the murderous terrorists and the peaceful, devout Muslims."Memorial Day" draws on today's hot-button issues: citizen's rights, captured prisoners' treatment, government secrecy and homeland security...all in a believable manner.Two guarantees: you will not be able to put this book down...and when you finish this cliffhanger, you will pray we have guys like Mitch Rapp on the front lines.

James Lee Burke's "White Doves at Morning" is richly written, peopled with well-drawn characters and beautifully atmospheric.It is an historical novel set in the Louisiana bayou country during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Fictional characters mingle with true-life figures---abolitionists, slaves, overseers, white trash, secessionists, madams and war profiteers. And. we see the origin of Angola Prison.The dialogue is magnificent, the moods created extraordinary and the pace is rhythmic.I found it compelling reading that engaged me from start to finish.The white trash villains are particularly despicable. The central protagonists, while flawed, are easy to cheer for.JLB maintains his high standards.

James Patterson phoned in "Four Blind Mice"---if, in fact, he actually bothered to write any of this uninspired, preposterous, formulaic, cookie-cutter thriller.The villains in this Alex Cross novel are unrealistic cartoonish parodies---the plot predictable, simplistic, unbelievable and all too pat.The love interest for Dr. Cross a painfully embarrassing distraction that fails to move the plot along and is nearly unreadable.Loose ends abounded.It is hard to believe this is the same author who gave us such absorbing, compelling and rousing fiction as: "The Midnight Club," "Black Market", "Pop Goes the Weasel", "Cat and Mouse" and the Edgar winning "Thomas Berryman Number."On the plus side, John Sampson is a spectacular supporting character. And, Mr. Patterson's short chapter, fast-paced writing style makes for a fast read.Too many trees died for this book.

The Old West. If you want to learn the real history, watch The History Channel---but if you want a crackling, fast paced and highly entertaining yarn about the mythic west, then "Appaloosa" by Robert Parker is the perfect way to spend a day.Marshall Virgil Cole and his deputy Everett Hitch are itinerant lawmen (town-tamers) who are hired by the aldermen in Appaloosa, where rouge rancher Randall Bragg and his hired guns have terrorized the town and killed the previous Marshall and deputy.Cole is a born killer who justifies himself by sticking to the letter of the law and the town must agree to let him make the laws.Mr. Parker's spare, terse prose sets perfect scenes with a handful of words and explores characters and motivations with intensity.Gunfighters, storekeepers, bar tenders, painted ladies, hostile Kiowas and people without a past come to life as members of the secondary cast.Cole's duplicitous and two-faced girlfriend is the wildcard that helps set situations akimbo.The narrative gallops along to a classic western ending with a twist...while throughout Mr. Parker has something to say about the nature of men and women in the Old West.With themes reminiscent of "The Magnificent Seven," "Gunfight at the OK Corral" and "My Darling Clementine" the story of Appaloosa is elegant western escapism.

I have become a John Leslie fan via his Key West PI Gideon Lowry series. I stumbled upon &quot;Bounty Hunter Blues&quot; in a used book store and glad I picked it up. Written in 1990 it is now out of print, but a most worthwhile read. A nifty collection of characters, some of whom are most Runyonesque. A twisty plot where the bad guys get their due. The good guys get their rewards, some rather unique. The plot is resolved in a believable way.Really glad I found this one. John Leslie's Gideon Lowry series is still in print and it is an enjoyable read.

This is a good read if you are a baseball fan. It becomes a very good read if one is a Baltimore Oriole fan. And, if one is an Oriole fan old enough to remember the early days it is simply excellent.The oral history told by those who made that history is just wonderful. Mr. Eisenberg has captured some great stories as the history of a once great franchise unfolds.The memories are spectacular as we hear from the franchise superstars and the lesser known role players over 46 years. This is story telling at its best. One is reminded of so many players that were part of O's story...and they truly come to life.The human side comes out as well and we are reminded of just how great a franchise it was and how it got that way. It should be required reading for every member of the current Oriole organization...they could learn something.I too was amazed that Chuck Thomson and Jon Miller were not interviewed and that Bill O'Donnell not mentioned...they were the voices that we all knew.

Shady characters, brilliant dialogue, irony, masterful writing and a lively and humorous story line are what we expect from Elmore Leonard. "Mr. Paradise," a Runyonesque tale, has all this and more...it does not disappoint.Eighty-four year old retired mob lawyer Tony Paradisio's favorite pastime is watching tapes of classic Michigan football victories with an escort or two cheering topless in ways not athletically encouraging.After learning that he has been eliminated from Mr. Paradise's will, Montez (Mr. P's main man) arranges a hit that is supposed to look like a home invasion gone wrong.The perps and Montez are members of the criminal mindless.Throw in two corpses, a Victoria Secret model witness, an identity switch, assorted lowlifes, a safe deposit box full of loot, the hitmen's "agent" and Frank Delsa (a resourceful Detroit homicide detective)---and the chase is on.The bad guys feel a sense of entitlement---leading to their demise. Getting caught being the real crime. Double-crosses, scams and deceptions propel the plot.The tight prose is filled with accurate conversation in the colorful vernacular of the urban scene."Mr. Paradise" is a stylistic, unforgettable, witty, fast-paced read. Elmore Leonard is a consistently entertaining writer---do not under rate him just because you like him.

Having read James Hall from the beginning I rank &quot;Rough Draft&quot; as his finest yet. Those other reviewers, for whom this is their first James Hall, have a lot of treats waiting for them.&quot;Rough Draft&quot; is a complex thriller, taking the cat and mouse game to new heights. Mr Hall's easy to read flowing writing style allows the reader to keep up with the twists, turns and red herrings without confusion.The chacters are deeply drawn and we get good insight into their professional and personal sides.Full of drama, suspense and tension this tale almost turns the pages for you. It took me a bit of willing suspension of disbelief concerning the villain's homicide method (but that's why they call it fiction). The conclusion was satisfying and whodunit a worthy surprise.I feel Mr. Hall could have another successful series if Frank and Hannah started their own PI firm.Count me among those puzzled by Mr. Hall's lack of recognition. He writes the Florida crime/mystery novel as well as anyone, and better than most.

Society bandleader Peter Duchin and Edgar Award winning author John Morgan Wilson team up and give us a smoothly written little mystery in "Blue Moon."Set in the San Francisco of 1963, they blend history with fiction in an action packed noirish plot.Celebrities and pop icons of the day from Joe DiMaggio to Andy Warhol---Jackie Kennedy to Jack Kerouac---Truman Capote to Willie Mays pop up along with a major part for Herb Caen.It has the feel of Archy McNally meeting up with The Thin Man---snappy dialogue, complex plot, lotsa characters with agendas, many cocktails, dead bodies and an alto sax playing San Francisco Inspector who sits in with the protagonist's (Philip Damon) band.It is an excellent amateur sleuth whodunit peopled with intriguing characters. The atmosphere of sixties San Francisco is truly captured.There are many laughs along the way. "Blue Moon" is big fun.

Jonathon King's fifth novel (first stand-alone), "Eye of Vengeance" is a riveting read and ought to be an Edgar nominee...it is that good.Mr. King maintains his high standards.Employing an economical cast of characters and utilizing lean prose, this hard-boiled narrative is compelling reading from cover to cover.Nick Mullins is a veteran reporter who covers the South Florida crime beat.Nick is searching for clues to what he suspects are connections between a serial sniper and some of his in depth profile stories.About halfway thru the book Nick and the readers learn who the sniper is---"Eye of Vengeance" is more about the why, rather than the usual whodunit.Nick has ghosts from his past that haunt him as he attempts to connect all the dots.Throughout the book, bad things happen to bad men---and you find yourself cheering for the lesser of the evil doers. There is no shortage of action and no dull moments.A very absorbing novel.

Joseph Finder's new thriller, "Company Man" is an elegantly engineered novel of corporate suspense.From the start the reader knows whodunit...but no idea where it will go or how it will get there.Stratton Corporation is a huge company that has supported its small Michigan town home base for generations. After being bought by a Boston holding company, the local hero/CEO (Nick Conover) is assigned the distasteful task of eliminating half the workforce.Immediately his status as the favorite son dissolves and he becomes the least popular man in town...it appears everyone has a grudge against him.Repeated home break-ins and graffitied messages escalate to the killing of the family dog.Nick fears for his children's lives...but who to trust? The police have no sympathy for the man who slashed all the jobs...and within the company; it looks as if everyone is out to betray him.Then, one act by Nick sets in motion the chain of unintended consequences. Events rapidly spiral utterly out of control."Company Man" is not the run of the mill, in your face thriller.It evolves as the adroit plot escalates and the characters develop. You get to know the individual players, but are fooled more than a few times by the illusive nature of much of the supporting cast.The Machiavellian conniving of so many keep you guessing and provide many "ah ha" moments.It is a wonderfully deceptive novel. It hooks you early and keeps you there.It is the prospect of disaster that creates the enormous apprehension, anxiety and tension in "Company Man."It is effortless reading.

Mr. Cramer absolutely makes him come alive.This is short, sweet, swift and pleasant read. It gets right to the point of this larger than life character.A must for any Ted Williams or Red Sox fan, and a delightful treat for any baseball fan.

Laura Lippman's complex thriller, "Every Secret Thing" is a haunting story about the loss of innocence and search for justice, told with extraordinary clarity.Two eleven-year-old girls abduct and eventually murder a three-year-old child. After seven years in separate juvenile detention centers they return to their lives and the outside world---without a clue how to adjust to it.When another child goes missing, suspicion again falls on the two now eighteen year olds.The point of view shifts seamlessly among several female characters---each with her version of the truth. Most are misled by what they feel or know to be false, but need to believe is true. No one truly confronts the full consequences of their fallibilities.While the initial crime is a given, and central to the story---it is the catalyst that defines the lives of all associated with the tragedy. How one act can affect so many---how one lie can do the same.All the characters are incredibly well developed and 100% believable.Ms. Lippman deftly illuminates them by keeping the plot moving backward and forward at the same time.This dark exploration of identity (among other themes) is timely, innovative, provocative and daring---but not depressing.The novel is so well crafted; the reader must get involved and become a participant.A wonderfully unpredictable book that captures your complete attention until you learn "Every Secret Thing." Its impact lasts long after the final page is turned.A masterpiece.

T. Jefferson Parker's "Cold Pursuit" is a classic crime story...a complicated tale that unfolds effortlessly. He is a most visual writer.Unanswered questions from the past frame the narrative. No one is quite what he or she appears as Detective Tom McMichael and his partner Hector Paz endeavor to unravel the truth about the murder of eighty-four year old San Diego patriarch Pete Braga.There are three generations of bad blood between the Portuguese Bragas and the Irish McMichaels. McMichael's basic decency and personal code eliminate any chance of a clouded judgement.There is no shortage of suspects: City Council members, the Catholic Diocese, a smuggling ring, the police force, members of either family---any of them could have done it.As McMichael exhumes the past to explain the current crime, you can never anticipate what is coming next.Each and every clue seems conflicting...altering newfound clarity into opaqueness in the turn of a page.Wonderful misdirection. To paraphrase Inspector Clouseau: "I suspected everyone and I suspected no one."A powerful ending. Do not miss this one.

I saw the movie prior to reading the book, and I am certain that made me appreciate the book all the moreSo much was happening simoulaneously in the Mog on October 3rd, 1993 and the book really clarified the sequence of events.The book was infomative, riveting, illuminating, disturbing and fast paced.Mark Bowden wrote with a deep passion and what seems like a true appreciation of what those men went thru. He puts the reader right into the action.You can feel the anguish, terror, grief and feeling of camarderie these men experienced.It is deeply moving book.

Is there another writer whose word pictures are more picturesque than those of James Lee Burke?The Robicheaux series keeps improving. This one fills in the back story on the detective's mother's death (murder).Her death intersects with current crimes and leads Robicheaux down a twisting path filled with wonderfully colorful chaacters (both good and bad.)Much is not as it first appears. The fine line between hero and villain is often murky as some of the rogues seem to possess some redeeming qualities. Naturally each of the &quot;white hats&quot; is flawed, having their own demons to overcome. It's a magnificent cross section of humanity and great slice of life.The various subplots dovetail nicely into a roaring finale. The story proceeds at an excellent even pace, never forced.&quot;Purple Cane Road&quot; is a well told tale that keeps you turning pages and guessing up to the final page.

While Lawrence Sanders was writing, the McNally books were always meant to be light hearted capers. A few laughs, a lot of grins, wry dialog and a host of quirky characters (rich and infamous). We still have the basics and it's always a treat to follow Archy's romps thru the Palm Beaches.At times Mr. Lardo seems to be trying too hard, but overall it is a fun read. I never seem to get enough of Al Rogoff and that didn't change.The characters were a wonderful rogues gallary, the loose ends neatly tied up and whodunit and how it was done were nifty surprises.I appreciate Mr. Lardo keeping Archy and the gang alive and will seek out his &quot;Hampton Affair&quot; novel.

Suspend your disbelief, open the book and take another great ride by Clive Cussler. Mr. Cussler is a master at tying together a myriad of subplots and weaving them into one great plot and resolution.This new NUMA pair is exciting and just as compelling as Dirk and Al. The situations are just close enough to the edge that you can imagine that, &quot;yes, maybe this really could happen.&quot;Expect a fast pace, clearly defined characters, contemptible villains and a satisfying ending. The multiple locations, NUMA resources and manpower are all here. It's a treat to have appearances from Admiral Sandecker, Rudy Gunn and Hiram Yeager.I look forward to additional adventures from Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. This is another series winner for Clive Cussler.Great fun.

I don't know that I read the Reacher novels as much as I am propelled thru them. "Without Fail" is no exception.Lee Child does more with a small cast than just about any writer I can think of. "Without Fail" has that austere, sparse feel that enables the reader to know all the principle characters quite well.Reacher is just a magnificent lead character...a loner, a superbly self-confident avenging arch angel, an idealist with an incorruptible set of ethics...more a presence than a character.With no fixed address and traveling lightly, he becomes a Lone Ranger transplanted in to the 21st century...riding off into the sunset when his mission is accomplished. In "Without Fail" he does (at least temporarily) acquire a couple of Tontos.Impossible to put down, a nifty insider's glimpse of the Secret Service, crisp action, high intensity plot...do not miss "Without Fail." It is Lee Child's best until the next one.

There's a lot to like in Robert Parker's "Perish Twice"---his second Sunny Randall novel.It keeps you guessing with a briskly paced plot. There is dialog that snaps, crackles and pops ("Tony would have you shot for stepping on his shadow if he were feeling grumpy.")Sunny is supported by a terrific and quirky ensemble. She's a capable, brainy, witty, tough, independent former cop, turned private eye. There are lots of curves as you try to solve this enigmatic puzzle.The book was better while Sunny was detecting, rather than playing relationship counselor.While I found the ending weak, the journey was fulfilling. I have found the others in the series more satisfying.

G.M. Ford's "Fury" is an attention getting noirish ticking clock mystery---from page one I was hooked.Newspaperman/true crime author Frank Corso is the protagonist in Mr. Ford's second series. He's a hard boiled, cynical anti-hero who prefers his solitude.He is a clever, resourceful and relentless archangel type---undaunted in his quest for justice as defined by his sense of right and wrong. Fiercely loyal to his friends, he is a commanding presence.Mr. Ford's atmospheric writing places the reader right in Seattle as Corso and his allies have six days to clear a venal death row inmate.It is a riveting plot that moves at a breakneck pace, told from multiple points of view.Mr. Ford has created another series peopled with characters you care about. "Fury" is the initial entry---highly recommended.

Robert Ferrigno's "Scavenger Hunt" is a subtle, darkly mesmerizing Hollywood tale of murder, ambition, frame-ups, set-ups, double-crosses and clever sleuthing.After serving seven years, Oscar winning producer Garrett Walsh is determined to prove his innocence. His vehicle is what he terms, the "most dangerous screenplay in Hollywood." Walsh wants SLAP magazine's cynical, skeptical, irreverent, high profile reporter Jimmy Gage to publicize the screenplay, before someone attempts to silence him permanently.Jimmy fails to buy in. But, when Walsh is found floating in his koi pond and the screenplay missing, Jimmy doubts it was the accidental death the police claim.No one shares Jimmy's thesis except his nefarious pal Rollo. Together they work their way thru a colorful cast of quirky Hollywood types, and around the cops who consider the case closed.The plot is superb: sophisticated, solid, circuitous and overflowing with scintillating dialogue.Mr. Ferrigno withholds enough info to keep surprises coming and the pages turning. The pace never slackens, and the accelerating danger of the killer keeps the tenseness at a high pitch.A delightful read. Hooray for Hollywood!

Peter Duchin's "Good Morning Heartache" is a most entertaining mystery-lite set in 1965 LA.A gig at the Cocoanut Grove brings Philip Damon and his orchestra to the West Coast.Recovering junkie Buddy Bixby subs for the ailing trumpet player and is working out well when he turns up dead with a needle in his arm. His is the second suspicious death since the band's arrival.Damon and his ex homicide detective/sax player know foul play they encounter it.Who stands to benefit from these deaths---a financially stressed "B" movie studio head, an embittered former child actor, a surfing legend/stunt man, a despised paparazzo, Buddy's sister, a highly regarded publicity agent, a remarkably beautiful ingenue or her mother?It is a great cast interspersed with real life pop icons of the time. Toots Shore, Joe DiMaggio, Gloria DeHaven, Rock Hudson, Art Pepper and the like share the pages with the fictional players.Accurate attention to details of the mid 1960's layout and life styles of LA and environs add to the pleasure of the novel.The plot moves seamlessly. Told in the first person, the reader has the same insight and frustration as Philip Damon as to whodunit.I had strong suspicions (correct) as to the culprit, but was never 100% certain and kept bewildered as to why until the end---always a positive sign.

The author e-mailed me from a review I had done in amazon.com, saying he thought I would enjoy his debut if I liked the Stephen Hunter novel. I figured that kind of door to door marketing and belief in one's product was just novel enough to warrent a looksee. The guy invented the start buttom for the PC, and that is way more than most accomplish in a lifetime. His writing career can be just as bright. He makes you care about the characters and the action really moves. I also liked the way everyone at Megasoft is known by their e-mail name. This was a fun read and the pages flew by.

John Katzenbach has assembled an authentic &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; of characters inside Western State Mental Hospital in his chilling thriller, &quot;The Madman's Tale.&quot;Narrator (C-Bird), both witness and schizophrenic whose hold on mental normalcy and self-preservation is tenuous, revisits the nightmare that took place twenty years ago.His narrative rotates between present day in first person and his third person memories.In 1979 a rape/murder inside the asylum brings in prosecuting attorney Lucy Jones (who has three unsolveds with similar profiles) to investigate. Lucy herself is a victim of a similar malicious crime.Her initial act is unorthodox; enlisting two inmates (C-Bird and Peter the Fireman) to aid her as &quot;they are the only ones I am certain are not guilty.&quot; Creating additional tension is a minimally cooperative and reluctant hospital management.Uncovering the killer hiding inside the institution is a most intriguing premise. There are no rules for pursuing a murderer in a mental institution where &quot;the mad know the truth and the sane cannot comprehend it.&quot;The serial killer circles around them, committing two additional murders during the investigation.Mr. Katzenbach creates an uneasy atmosphere filled with evil, darkness and an engrossing sense of foreboding.The unfortunate, unlikely heroes are sympathetic characters that you worry and care about. You cannot anticipate what will happen next.This tale will linger in your mind long after the final page. It commands your attention and has a terrific conclusion.

The plot accelerates from the cover to the conclusion at a furious pace.Protagonist Henry Pierce is a Stanford educated computer genius, whose company is ready to patent a revolutionary molecular delivery system that could transform the medical profession. But if Henry can't get the multimillion-dollar funding shortly, his rivals will prevail. Henry's maniacal focus on perfecting the system has destroyed his personal life.He has moved to an apartment. His new phone number previously belonged to an escort and is still posted on her web site.

Henry is an ordinary man suddenly caught up in something with which he has no experience. The law of unintended consequences takes over and Henry learns that even paranoids have real enemies.Mr. Connelly is the master of the sly plot twist. I fell for every red herring, misdirection and false lead---and did not figure out whodunit until it was painfully obvious. I was glued to the book from the compelling beginning to the action-packed finale. Do not miss this high concept thriller.

Michael McGarrity has a wonderful writing style. The pages just fly by. He sets scenes in the beautiful New Mexico landscape that place you there. His books have all lived up to the high standard set with his initial novel, &quot;Tularosa&quot;...no easy trick. His pacing really works...it was like eating peanuts...I had to read &quot;just one more&quot; passage before putting it down.The characters are realistic, well defined and simply a great mix. The protagonist, Kevin Kerney, is unique in the cop/mystery genre in that he is pretty normal. He is not the prototypical flawed man who must ovcercome a myriad of personal demons. A limp resulting from a bullet to the kneecap is his only eccentricity. Kerney is a top cop, but also an excellent manager of people. His staff responds not only to his abilities, but also to the respect he shows all with whom he works. With all his field experience, he has seen it all and is hard to fool. He gets the job the right way and is easy to cheer for.His romantic interest returns, but her sidebar does nothing to detract from the whodunit aspect. She is a strong character, a good addition and we will see more of her.Mr. McGarrity has crafted a strong series with characters that stand out, all placed in a most atmospheric setting. I think he and the Kevin Kerney series are understated and underappreciated gems. He deserves more acclaim and recognition. He was suggested to me with these words: &quot;if you enjoy Michael Connelly, McGarrity is for you.&quot; I do and he is.Do not miss this sereis.

I have read CH from the beginning and this one falls far short of his wonderfully funny previous novels. It seems this vein has been mined too many times. It's the same type of characters in slightly different sourroundings. This time they appear tired, trite and ready for a change. I recall only two out loud laughs, whereas his prior books never failed to elicit many many hearty laughs.Carl Hiaasen is capable of so much more. It is time for a change of pace and a fresh approach from one of the finest writers Florida has produced. Being based in Miami he certainly has no shortage of material upon which to draw.

Characters are well developed and one can easily care about them. I certainly am interested in the continuing relationships. Well resolved and has me ready to pick up the next one in the Ariel series ASAP.

So, the Final Four is coming up the first weekend in April---and you say your brackets are in shambles.Well, you can find great solace and enjoyment in John Feinstein's paean to March Madness, "Last Dance, Behind the Scenes at the Final Four."Since he has been going to the Final Four since 1978 (before it went to 64 teams), he has plenty of wonderful tales to tell.The focal point is 2005's North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan State and Louisville tournament.However, he strays and presents a lot of magnificent history in the form of back-stories. Therefore, it not a play-by-play type of book---rather it reads like a novel.He presents insights into the teams, the selection committee, players past and present, coaches, the officials, the fans and the legends.It is all told in a relaxed, lyrical anecdotal fashion that is so easy to read that you never realize how much you learning.Totally absorbing, and perfect for this time of year---or any time of year

Told in the first person, Lee Child's &quot;The Enemy&quot; is the prequel in his electrifying Jack Reacher series. The pace of this intricate tale crackles from page one and accelerates from there.It is New Year's Eve, 1990 and the Berlin Wall is crumbling and Reacher is still a rising star in the Military Police.Reacher gets the call to &quot;control the situation&quot; of the death of a two star general found in a fleabag motel. Soon the general's wife is found murdered, his briefcase (containing the agenda to a high level meeting) missing, and a Delta Force soldier murdered,. The convoluted clues point to Reacher!A deceitful CO, a Psy-Ops officer and meddling civilians complicate Reacher's progress.Laconic loner Reacher is joined by the ambitious, resourceful, aggressive Lt. Summer in the quest for the truth.&quot;The Enemy&quot; is the least violent Reacher novel...relying on mystery and astute police procedural techniques to move the plot with speed and strength.This is the career crunching case that infuses cynicism into Reacher's psyche and transforms him into a dangerous man.The cover-ups and political conspiracies compel him to perform a surreptitious investigation with no patience for rules.The investigation ends in a staggering, unexpected showdown.While the bad guys get their comeuppance, the degenerates who actually are in charge still rule the roost. It is no wonder Reacher eventually leaves the military for his lone wolf existence.&quot;The Enemy&quot; is an intelligent, thoughtful, suspenseful, hard charging narrative that will enthrall you from page one.Perhaps Lee Child's finest effort.

It is a fast read that captivated me immediately. A great whodunit where the unexpected is par for the course.There is a bit of Travis McGee in McKnight, a fiercely loyal non-PI surrounded by an outstanding supporting cast (especially Leon Prudell).There is plenty of fear in WOTWM as Russian mobsters, DEA types and a psychotic villain may or may not be what they appear to be. Full of action and wonderful descriptive passages that place you right in Michigan's UP.Steve Hamilton has a bright future.

This is the real Magic Kingdom."

The second Billy Bob Holland story is a wonderful read. This is a series to look forward to.It is a complex plot, fully resolved containing the atmospheric writing that JLB does as well as any writer. You are transported to Deaf Smith and are made to feel a part of the area.It is peopled with flawed characters, both good and bad. No one is perfect, and you are certain you've known or observed most of them. The players are a rogue's gallery, many of whom are lovable...some forgivable, others unrepentant and unsympathetic. A few have redeeming characteristics beneath a questionable exterior. It's a remarkable cast.It is always a treat to read JLB. He never fails to entertain and brings great emotion to his words. It's quite delightful that he is giving readers two series to savor. Don't miss &quot;Heartwood.&quot;

Harry Bosch is asked by a friend's widow to investigate her husband's death. She suspects that it was murder, not a heart attack.Concurrently, tarnished FBI agent Rachel Walling (on a "hardship posting" in South Dakota) receives a late night phone call from Quantico indicating that a demonic serial killer, assumed dead, is back in business.The simultaneous plots converge at the Zzyzx Road exit on Highway 15 between Las Vegas and LA.Harry's quest and Rachel's investigation eventually lead to a partnership that adds tension to the story.The characters are well drawn and believable; their strengths and weaknesses probed.Mr. Connelly is a master at quietly producing continuous action that explodes exponentially into a white-knuckle ride.His ability to hide clues in plain sight is extraordinaryTaut suspense, intricate plotting and the captivating premise propel Harry and Rachel in their pursuit of the diabolical villain.It is "cat and mouse" at the highest level.The overriding struggles and characters are potent and persuasive, the plot labyrinthine, the twists logical yet unforeseen.Michael Connelly is the magical virtuoso of present day crime fiction. He defines and refines the genre---never playing it safe."The Narrows" is the most peerless example of contemporary noir writing imaginable.I am certain one can enjoy "The Narrows" without having read "The Poet"---but if one does, it will spoil one's reading of "The Poet."

Michael Connelly's ninth Harry Bosch novel, "Lost Light" is told in the first person, giving nice insights into Harry's mind and the demons he fights. In the first person, Michael Connelly feels: "the writer cannot hold anything back without being dishonest.""Lost Light" is hardboiled with quick pacing, ingenious plot twists, intrigue and strong character development. The prose is lean and powerful, with a few overt homages to Raymond Chandler.Michael Connelly has said that: "Harry Bosch is the prism I see LA thru," and LA remains a viable character in "Lost Light."Harry Bosch has left the LAPD, making "Lost Light" Michael Connelly's initial PI novel. Harry revisits an unsolved murder case. Add to this inner mystery, the outer mysteries of a $2 million heist at a movie location and a missing FBI agent. LAPD, FBI and an Anti-Terrorist unit all warn Harry to keep out, making his quest all the more intense.The presumably straightforward plot builds to a sequence of surprises, both in the investigation and Harry's personal life.Harry Bosch never disappoints. Do not wait for the paperback.

Took me three Lehane books to catch on to what all the raving was about. &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; was too depressing for me. While I enjoyed &quot;Sacred&quot;, I thought that was due to the Florida locations.But with &quot;Prayers For Rain&quot; I am converted and will now read his entire repertoire. It's Mr. Lehane's writing that's the winner, not just the Florida settings of &quot;Sacred.&quot;The lead characters and their network are quite colorful and the action is first rate. It's truly a fast read and the resolution is satisfying.The small backstory on Bubba was a big help for me in accepting and understanding this off center character.This series could easily have screen possibilities with Ben Affleck my choice to play the lead.

A Plus for T. Jefferson Parker's incredible "California Girl."Stylish and engaging, it transports you back to 1968 in Orange County (and up to present day)...again mixing real life characters (Dick Nixon, Tim Leary, Charles Manson) with a fictional cast of vividly sketched characters.The three Becker brothers (a cop, a crime reporter and a minister) have an intense commitment to finding the truth about a decapitated friend from their teenage years.Their search for the facts leads to compromise, concessions and exposure of the brothers' secrets.It is a subtle, sophisticated, cerebral novel with justice the overruling topic...no matter how long it may take.A well-crafted look back at a period of time that fashioned a generation told in a most intriguing manner.As good as any book I have read this year.

Quite simply I rate &quot;The Poet&quot; as the best mystery/crime thriller I have ever read starting with The Hardy Boys as a youngster in the 1950's. I cannot count the number of times I have given this book as a gift to introduce friends to Miacael Connelly. It never fails to hook them and make them Michael Connelly fans as well. In my opinion Mr. Connelly is the finest in the genre currently writing. The Poet was impossible to put down. In fact I was sorely tempted to cheat and read some of the ending chapters early in the read. Resisted the temptation, but few books have enticed that behavior in me.

It had been about five years since I first read &quot;The Poet.&quot; At that time I thought it was the finest mystery novel I had read. That judgement still stands. I was compelled to reread it after reading Mr. Connelly's &quot;A Darkness More Than Night,&quot; as protagonist Jack McEvoy appears in both novels.My only regret is that I did not reread &quot;The Poet&quot; prior to reading &quot;ADMTN&quot;, as I had forgotten how the McEvoy character had changed and evolved as &quot;The Poet&quot; progressed, and was surprised to find him so cynical in &quot;ADMTN.&quot;In any event, &quot;The Poet&quot; can stand stand on its own.It was impossible to relax as the plot unfolded. Trying to deduce who's the villain, is quite an exercise and keeps you guessing and constantly changing your mind. Just as challenging is figuring out who among those who appearto be allies are truly foes. It is complex, but not Byzantine.Pretty amazing that five years later I was just as hooked rereading it as I was on my initial read. Do not miss this one.

Winning an Edgar gets my attention...especially when the competition includes Robert Crais' &quot;L.A. Requiem.&quot;I can easily come up with another half dozen 1999 releases in the mystery/thriller genres that I read that did much more for me.Michael Connelly's &quot;Void Moon&quot;, Lee Child's &quot;Tripwire&quot;, Vince Flynn's &quot;Transfer of Power&quot;, Michael McGarrity's &quot;Hermit's Peak&quot;, &quot;Hart's War&quot; by John Katzenbach and Daniel Silva's &quot;The Marching Season&quot; all rate much higher on my enjoyment scale than &quot;Bones.&quot;And, &quot;L.A. Requiem&quot; was certainly the most compelling read for me of the '99 issues I read.Jan Burke is surely a fine writer. &quot;Bones&quot; is well crafted and carefully plotted. For my money, Stephen Hunter has given us far more loathsome killers, Michael Connelly more diabolical villains and Nelson DeMille characters more ruthless.I liked and cared about Irene and her husband as well as some of the minor players such as Leonard (the security guard) and will read more of her body of work.As &quot;Hocus&quot; shows up as Terry McCaleb's friend Buddy's book of choice in Michael Connelly's &quot;Bloodwork&quot; I will be reading that one shortly. Its subject matter is more in my ballpark.It seems I am missing something that grabbed others in &quot;Bones&quot;, but I enjoyed the writing etc.; however the characters didn't do it for me. Just seems there were lots more impressive reads debuting in 1999.

Robert B. Parker is a master at putting together the character, plot and dialogue combo.His fourth Sunny Randall novel, "Melancholy Baby" is no exception. What's not to like?Sunny is a dynamic, thirty-seven year old Boston PI from a law enforcement family. She has plenty of baggage and a dog that gets much too much attention...but is resourceful and is surrounded by a marvelously drawn, frequently eccentric supporting cast.The dialogue is sizzling and witty---the chatter scintillates. The colloquy is magic, snappy, cadenced and crisp.The characters sparkle, especially Eugene Corsetti, a NY cop. He is a classic---arrogant, astute and full of attitude. I hope he reappears in future Parker novels.The solution to the puzzle is no shocker...but the journey is such a fun ride you are addicted all the way to the final page.

T. Jefferson Parker's "Black Water" is the third in the Merci Rayborn series.She is an Orange County (CA) Sheriff Department detective. She is a flawed, difficult, complex woman filled with contradictions and self-doubt---just a great character.Even as we know the suspect is innocent, T. Jeff holds your interest with a suspenseful, intricate plot whose pace accelerates as new clues appear and the pieces of the puzzle start to fit.His extensive research into human memory loss adds authenticity to the story. He weaves in the character-developing subplot without interfering with the main plot.Merci must deal not only with finding the bad guys, but with headline seeking media types, skeptical colleagues, her boss and a DA looking for an easy case. Her procedural moves are convincing and lead both her and the wrongly accused suspect to Russian Organized Crime (ROC) in Southern California.There is more character interplay in this than the preceding two, especially between Merci and her new partner, Paul Zamora.T. Jeff is an articulate, fluid and descriptive writer with another winner.

Chose this as part of vacation reading while on holiday in Scottsdale and was not disappointed. Very fast read and one of those situations you can believe really happens. Sets the scene in the Phoenix area beautifully and you get to know all the characters quite well. Action is fast paced and found it successfully resolved. Will go for more in this series. Thought Joanna Brady to be a worthy protagonist.

Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus, two sharp street detectives, comprise the newly formed, Mobile, Alabama Psychological and Sociopathological Investigative team in Jack Kerley's astounding debut novel, "The Hundredth Man." Nautilus is the wizened veteran on the "psycho-crimes" pair.When two headless corpses, inked with puzzling and bizarre messages turn up, the chase is on. The beheadings are clean and precise, indicating a pro. The crimes are at once reprehensible as well as cool, calm and deliberate.Carson and Harry's investigation is undermined by the police department political circus and the secrets that abound in the Medical Examiner's office.In fact, most everyone has a secret and a past to protect. The back-stories make for fascinating characters thrown together with startling results.The action is fast paced, moving between crime scenes to the autopsies in the morgue...with sidebars where Harry and Carson outwit the police brass and the perp.Snappy dialogue and intriguing characters help propel the unpredictable plot. It is a spectacular ride---a journey so gripping, it is easy to overlook the way over-the-top finale.A captivating debut...I look forward to more from Jack Kerley.

T.J. MacGregor won this year's Edgar for best Paperback Original with "Out of Sight."More of a SciFi/X-Files type, rather than a mystery read to me...but quite entertaining none the less.Being a sucker for all government conspiracy theories, I was hooked from the start.A shadow national security organization is funding a "mad scientist" type who has perfected a process that can render people invisible.One invisible subject escapes and three more are zapped by accident. Their quest to bring down the covert project while being hunted by the shadow organization's thugs is classic cat and mouse.Some great characters on both sides...extremely fast paced...superb South Florida settings. A bit too long, but with a suspension of disbelief, this is big fun.

Paul Brenner is a wonderful protagonist. He is a glib, sarcastic, cynical realist. His retorts and thoughts bring grins, smiles and laughs to the reader. He has strong supporting cast in &quot;Up Country.&quot;&quot;Up Country&quot; is part travelogue, part spy games, part fox and hounds chase. It is also a lengthy novel, so the characters are fully developed. The reader learns a lot about Paul Brenner and Viet Nam thru flashbacks as he tours many of the places where he served in the war. The scenes are brilliantly set.His advesaries are in his own camp as well as the enemy's. Never is there a moment when he knows exactly who he can trust on his mission.&quot;Up Country&quot; works on many levels, and the journey is better than the destination. However, once at the destination, just enough loose ends are left to suggest the possibility of a sequel.For Paul Brenner fans, that is good news indeed.Nelson Demille is just a wonderful writer who does his homework. A lot of research went into &quot;Up Country&quot; and that preparation is evident in every page. I could not put this one down.

... I found it to be a nice treat.It was an interestinglook at the workings of the repoman and an enlightning look at the gypsy lifestyle.The members of the DKA agency were wonderfully drawn characters...very Runyon-esque. The gypsy characters could not have been more colorful. The plots and sidebars were neatly tied together.There is a lot of humor mixed in with the crime, trackdowns, deceptions, double dealings and repo procedural. This would make a great movie. The action never stops and Mr. Gores does a great job of putting the reader inside the mind of the players.&quot;32 Cadillacs&quot; was very entertaining and my initial Joe Gores book. I feel like I have discovered a new writer and look forward to more fun reads by Joe Gores.

Superbly crafted with many fully developed characters (good and bad) filled with tense drama and unending suspense...and an ending with a satisfying resolution as not every good guy remains standing.Some suspension of disbelief may be necessary, but not a ton.In times of extreme duress against impossible odds (especially in battle) many times men have risen to incredible heights. It is this aspect of the human spirit that is central to &quot;By The Rivers Of Babylon&quot; and makes it so credible. It is the story peopled with unlikely heroes who surprise even themselves as they rise to the occasion.I was drawn to the protagonists and their indomital vitality under pressure. It was refreshing that all were flawed, but none beyond redemption.The villians were exceedingly well drawn and particularly abhorrent.A most exciting and fulfilling reading experience.EOM

Jack Reacher is a good protagonist, and no less believable than Dirk Pitt, James Bond, etc. Any action adventure takes some willing suspension of disbelief as well the ability to accept coincidences. That said, I have become a Reacher fan. As in &quot;Killing Floor&quot; he gets in the wrong place at the wrong time and is considered a bad guy by other good guys. Using whatever resources are at hand he presses on and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I did think &quot;Killing Floor&quot; a stronger read, but look forward to this series continuing.

"The Bone Orchard" by D. Daniel Judson is a classic hard-boiled PI novel.Declan MacManus is a sometime PI, full time boozer and guilt ridden by his past. He is on unfriendly terms with the local cops and trouble seems to gravitate toward him.Reluctantly accepting an assignment from big time PI Frank Gannon, Declan witnesses a single car accident while on stakeout. He is convinced the "accident" was staged and is murder. Was he set up as a witness to insure a speedy inquest?Declan cannot let it go and upsets powerful people as he and his partner (ex DEA) Augie investigate.When Augie gets ambushed Declan puts himself in harm's way to save his friend. While moody, boozy, reclusive and paranoid---Declan is a renegade with a powerful sense of justice, a true anti-hero.The dark and mysterious plot moves in nonstop fashion, full of vivid scenes, with sufficient murder and turmoil. Uncovering the manipulator of the conspiracy is the whodunit and the twists and turns are impossible to predict."The Bone Orchard" is an excellent debut novel and worthy Shamus nominee. Mr. Judson gets the maximum from a minimum number of characters and spare prose. A bright star on the mystery horizon

Shamus nominated (PBO), "The Poisoned Rose by D. Daniel Judson is a dark, hard-boiled, noir novel of what could have been, what is, regret, guilt and mayhem.Part time PI Declan MacManus is morose, somber, troubled---his world is bleak and fueled by alcohol and vegetarian fare. At his core he is a decent guy who abhors injustice and is fiercely loyal to his limited number of friends.A killer, the police chief and the past are after him---and who is the mastermind manipulating all this?The whodunit turns on the past haunting the present---but more than a superb whodunit, the story is the mystery of MacManus.Flowing with action, fast paced, a multi-colored cast of lawbreakers, "The Poisoned Rose" is perpetual motion. Mr. Judson's prose is lean and economical and the plot is completely unpredictable.I finished it in less than twenty-four hours---could not put it down.

This was a disappointment and not at all what I expected from a book that won an Edgar. If the soap opera dialog and interaction between the protagonist (Grace Rossi) and her daughter, mother, father, exhusband, best friend were eliminated there would be a wonderfully compact legal whodoneit. The characters involved in the legal action are believable, the plot interesting and is nicely resolved. This is not the only award winner for Lisa Scottoline, so I am tempted to try another, hoping for less soap and more thrills.

&quot;In Big Trouble&quot; is very well written, carefully plotted and full of good characters.As I am reading the Tess Monaghan series in order, this is my 4th Laura Lippman read. This is easily her best mystery in the whodunit and plotting categories. Lots of red herrings and plenty of possible suspects.It is her first one that takes place outside of Baltimore, and that was a minus for me. Having lived in Baltimore, I find her a great voice for that great city. Her books give me my Baltimore fix...so with 95% of the action Texas I was disappointed.That said, this is a strong work and well worth reading. It truly shows how the author has grown as a mystery writer.So, if Texas locations are what you like, this is a spectacular read.I look forward her &quot;The Sugar House&quot; shortly.

Usually I avoid the British mystery genre. While "A Place of Execution" by Val McDermid was nominated for the 2001 Best Novel Edgar, it was the high praise from Michael Connelly and Steve Hamilton that compelled me to read it.It is an excellent police procedural, albeit quite Dickensian. The two protagonists are skillfully drawn as are the secondary cast members.And you are realistically transported to the English country villages of the early sixties---with some great pop culture references as well.The plot proceeds at a deliberate pace due to much backtracking. That is very helpful due to the number of important bit players.The book requires effort on the part of the reader, and it does pay off.Overall I thought it could have been shorter and am not driven to read more of her books.Back to Michael Connelly and Steve Hamilton.

Michael Crichton's "Timeline" is a most entertaining mix of adventure, believable science fact and fiction, time travel and historical fiction.Suspend your disbelief and you are transported to the 14th century in Medieval France (the Hundred Year War)---the era is beautifully brought to life amidst the knights, damsels and castles.A most unlikable billionaire high-tech genius entrepreneur wants to make the past his theme park. Using believable science, Mr. Crichton convinces you that time travel is possible. That time travel is how the billionaire will create his parks.Something goes awry and three historians must be sent back to rescue a colleague---with a 37 hour ticking clock.Many surprises and twists keep you guessing and wondering about the outcome.Memorable characters, sparkling dialogue laced with wry humor and clever subplots weave an imaginative story line.I found it just as fascinating and engaging on this second read as when it came out four years ago.A most refreshing tale well told.

C.J. Box's third Joe Pickett novel, "Winterkill" is simply magnificent.Joe, a Wyoming game warden is good at his job, a loyal family man, a good guy with flaws and doubts who does not suffer incompetents.The murder of a Forest Service supervisor brings in federal bureaucrats led by the spiteful, psychotic and underhanded Melinda Strickland.She immediately and incorrectly railroads Nate Romanowski, a local loner with a mysterious past.When the government hating survivalists, the Sovereign Citizens camp on nearby federal land, Strickland recognizes a high profile opportunity. She is willing to orchestrate a bloody conflict to further her career.Pickett understands the potential disaster, and with Nate attempts to uncover the true murderer before the showdown commences.In the end, Joe must bend the law to insure justice---an act that deepens the character.Filled with bright characters, the severe beauty of a Wyoming winter and incredible suspense, "Winterkill" is a present-day take on the old fashioned western.Outstanding!

Another fast read from Mr. Meltzer. Certainly fiction that requires a complete suspension of disbelief.However, all this ground was covered in his most enjoyable &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; with a far more interesting cast of characters and a more subtle plot. This is merely a variation on that theme, and not as well done as the original. Some of the characters are simply cartoonish in their incredulity.I found nothing original here and was underwhelmed.

Ariel Gold is a strong protagonist. One I have grown to like after two books. I enjoyed &quot;Fast Forward&quot; more. This one was too heavy in the romance department for my taste. Would have prefered more suspense. Ariel finds trouble coming at her head on and obliquely as she works towards solving a two year old murder. Ms. Mercer makes it easy to like the good guys in Ariel's circle, and I hope to hear more from her grandfather (B.F.) and his pal Sarge. I had a hard time accepting Ariel's new love interest and hope that coworker Henry again will become the object of her affection.

Robert Crais is a member of the LA mystery writer's varsity.His latest, "The Two Minute Rule," is as good as anything he has written.The two-minute rule is the bank robber's truism: get in, get the money and get out in less than two minutes.Max Holman had succeeded heeding this axiom until he stopped to give CPR to a bank customer having a heart attack. That sent him away for ten years.After finishing his stretch, his only real goal is to reconcile with his estranged son---now a family man and rookie cop (everything Max was not).Hours prior to his release, Max is informed his son and three other LA cops were gunned down while having a mysterious meeting in the middle of the night.Now Max wants to learn how his son died, and how he lived.LAPD stonewalls Max. They allege the shooter was a gang member out for revenge, who conveniently committed suicide. The story does not ring true.The only person Max trusts to help him find the truth is Katherine Pollard, the FBI agent who arrested him.Against her better judgment, now ex-agent Pollard, agrees to assist. Once in, her "thrill of the hunt" juices kick in...she is hooked.Skirting the law at every turn, they uncover a police conspiracy---or is it an investigation within the official investigation. Are Max's son and the other cops dirty?This odd couple pairing rings true as each responds to the core of integrity they see in the other.The plotting is superior and the characters grip you early and hold you close right to the phenomenal conclusion. With each twist, you will pick someone else as your chief suspect.To tell more would be a crime and ruin an exceptionally intriguing plot.There is truly nothing as righteous as a good mystery.Like Michael Connelly, Robert Crais elevates crime fiction.

Steve Hamilton's fifth Alex McKnight novel, "Blood Is the Sky" is attention getting and packed with tension.It begins metaphorically as Alex rebuilds his friendship with neighbor Vinnie Red Sky LeBlanc as they reconstruct a cabin lost to arson.Soon they learn that Vinnie's parolee brother Tom is overdue from a hunting trip to Canada. Tom used Vinnie's ID to cross the border for a lucrative guide's fee...a parole violation and not a bright idea.The ensuing search for the party has the visceral fear of "Deliverance."The unspoiled beauty of the Canadian wilds turns into a horrifying crime scene. McKnight and Vinnie's relentless pursuit of the perps leads to many disquieting questions...with no easy answers.Full of twists and turns, the plot flow is captivating. McKnight is a remarkable noir hero whose fervent loyalty to his friends always gets him involved in their problems...an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances.Steve Hamilton gets better and better. "Blood Is the Sky" both resolves and raises issues for McKnight...maybe even romance.Put this on your most wanted list.

This is extremely well written and carefully crafted. A novel that is both a thriller and a whodunit. I have thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Standiford's John Deal series, and this departure showcases his depth as a writer.There are enough twists and turns in this cat and mouse plot to keep your interest from start to finish. The characters are a bit larger than life, so there is a need to suspend your disbelief. It is ordinary people performing extraordinary feats.There is a great deal of attention paid to details and for this reason I feel this book will provide even greater pleasure to those who hike or climb mountains.

Daniel Silva's "The Confessor" is tightly written with an intricate plot and subplots...a thinking man's international espionage thriller. Full of subtle touches that invigorate the plot...it is a sophisticated novel.Protagonist Gabriel Allon, an art restorer/sleeper Mossad agent is chosen to investigate the murder of an author (and former Israeli agent) whose research unearths the Vatican's dirty secret. The Vatican's silence during WWII shows complicity between the Vatican and the Nazis that furthered the Holocaust.While searching for the murderer Gabriel is hunted by both the assassin and a shadow organization within the Vatican. That organization (Vera Crux) will stop at nothing to keep the secret hidden.Connecting the dots, Mossad uncovers a plot to assassinate the current Pope who desires to make the Vatican's covert files public.The intrigue is intense with a multitude of richly drawn characters. The characters are introduced gradually and are well developed, eliminating the confusion often found in complicated plots. Gabriel's recapping his progress to various contacts is a skillful device that keeps the reader on track with the protagonist.The author's notes at the conclusion, where facts take over from fiction, make the story all the more chilling.

"Ice Run" is Steve Hamilton's sixth Alex McKnight novel...and the first that failed to electrify me.Just as the first major blizzard of winter pelts Michigan's UP, Alex is off for a romantic weekend with his newly found love, Ontario Provincial Police officer, Natalie Renaud.Things get weird as soon as Alex arrives. An immaculately dressed elderly man approaches Alex and joins him in the elevator. The man shows Alex his out-of-date homberg, asking Alex to guess how old it is. Trying to ignore him, Alex remains silent.Later that evening, the old man is found frozen to death...and the hat placed in front of Alex's hotel room filled with ice, snow and a note that says, "I KNOW WHO YOU ARE."This incident restarts a generations old blood feud...Natalie's past being as scarred as Alex's. As usual, Alex will go to the mat for a friend in jeopardy.He gets beaten within an inch of his life...and remains far from any answers. I felt Alex pulled so many stupid moves, that all credulity was stretched...and found his girl friend totally unsympathetic---slowing the plot.On the plus side, we see quite a bit of Leon Prudell (Alex's former PI partner) as well as Vinnie LeBlanc, Alex's Ojibway comrade. These two are outstanding and well defined supporting characters.The usual wonderful sense of place that is a Steve Hamilton hallmark transports you into the middle of the frozen landscape.A C+.

Stuart Woods is such a good story teller that he can even make a Goldwater Republican like me cheer for the very liberal Democrat Will Lee as he runs for President.This is the third book featuring Will Lee, so his character is fully developed, and those surrounding him (family, friends and professional associates) are equally well defined. Of the three books I liked &quot;Grassroots&quot; the best.In &quot;The Run&quot;, those trying to prevent Will Lee from being elected come from within his own party, the Republicans and an ultra right wing paramilitary organization attempting to assassinate him. An unlikely ally resides in a maximum security prison for treason-like activities.Mr. Woods' novels all move at a speedy pace and &quot;The Run&quot; is no exception. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary, but that does nothing to detract from the book's enjoyment. I guess that's why they call it fiction.Will Lee is that rare politico with no skeletons that can lead to his downfall. But, you do get to experience the backroom deals, the ugly back stabbing of Washington politics and the D.C. intrigue.&quot;The Run&quot; is a fun, quick and timely weekend read that is sure to keep you turning pages, caring for the characters and cheering for Will Lee.

Dave Barry's "Tricky Business" is an amusing, satirical South Florida romp. An assortment of losers, bad dudes, seniors and a bad rock band are mixed together on a gambling ship amid Hurricane Hector.Naturally the ship in a mob owned drug exchange vessel that must make a rendezvous. Of course a nefarious double-cross is afoot.And so, the games begin.When one of the central characters started as a crooked airbag replacement king---moved up to cut-rate LASIK centers---founded Happy Conch fast fooderies (no conch, just fried batter to lower costs)---you know irony, humor and derision will keep you rapidly turning pages.The sardonically embellished vignettes of Miami life alone are worth the price of admission."Tricky Business" is funny business.

Found initial 2/3 a bit slow and at times a little tedious. When the setting shifted to Florida the action picked up and pages started turning. Don't know if it was a worthwhile payoff. Solid writing as usual and a couple of characters who would be interesting to see again if set in Florida. Eagerly await the next installment in the Jake Lassiter series. Much more fun than these folks.

For my money John Lutz ranks high among the crop of Florida mystery writers. He does not have the high profile of the likes of Carl Hiaasen, James Hall, Edna Buchanan, Dave Barry, Elmore Leonard, Randy Wayne White, etc., but he captures the essence of Florida in wonderfully spare novels.Consider this word picture of the Central Florida heat: &quot;On his left, the ocean rolled blue-green and too sluggish for whitecaps, as if it felt the burden of the heat and was lulled to lethergy.&quot; Anyone who spent time in Central Florida between May and October has experienced that feeling.&quot;Kiss&quot; is a Fred Carver, PI entry. Carver, retired due to disability from the Orlando PD (shot in kneecap and needs a cane), now resides along the mid Florida East Coast. While his supporting cast is excellent, he prefers to work alone and maintain self reliance.The plot is believable, the crime feasable, the crooks a fine mixture of brains, brawn and corrupted innocents. Throw in a couple of red herrings, dogged detective work, menace from a psycho, all under the hot Florida sun and you are rewarded with an enjoyable read.

No sophomore slump for Jonathon King. His debut ("Blue Edge of Midnight") was nominated for an Edgar and "A Visible Darkness" is equally as strong.The characters are realistic...you have seen or met all of them...the villains you have avoided and averted eye contact.Protagonist Max Freeman has taken disability from the Philadelphia PD and moved to the Florida Everglades. A Fort Lauderdale lawyer he grew up with is his civilized world contact and anchor. He is serious, smart, studious and careful.Max has not lost his investigative instincts and is compelled to avenge wrongs in an almost vigilante way. The crimes are particularly despicable...more a how and why dunit, as we know the perp from the start. Working with his lawyer and the FLPD, the investigation takes Max into Fort Lauderdale's drug market. There he forms a most unusual alliance.The plotting is swift. The romantic subplot and flashbacks to his Philly days add depth and fill in a few blanks.Mr. King writes like a veteran. This is a most provocative series.Highest possible recommendation.

I was mildly entertained by Lawrence Block's "Even the Wicked." "A Walk Among the Tombstones" was gritty enough to get me to try my third Matthew Scudder: "A Ticket to the Boneyard."Now I am hooked, and will read the entire series.Scudder is an ex-NYPD cop...a flawed, complex, likeable, pragmatic character. Now an unlicensed PI, he investigates for his friends.The plot in "Boneyard" roars along from page one with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing all the way. Not predictable. The villain is one of the most realistic, despicable and depraved I have run across.Great hard-edged writing that leaps off the pages.I am making Lawrence Block a priority.

In "Paint It Black" Florida author P.J. Parrish brings protagonist Louis Kincaid to Soreno Key in the Sunshine State.Louis Kincaid's former cop boss has hooked Louis up with a local lawyer for some investigative work.His attempt to clear his client of murder leads to a search for a serial killer.Louis and the Soreno Key PD work well together and are joined by a feisty, rookie FBI profiler. This alliance is further strengthened as they attempt to prevent an incompetent county sheriff from botching the investigation.This is an efficient police procedural filled with nifty twists and turns. I bit on enough of the subtle red herrings to remain in doubt until the conclusion."Paint It Black" is nominated for this year's Anthony Award in the Paper Back Original category. Well deserved!This is a smart series with a strong lead character; solid secondary characters and now set in Southwest Florida.I look forward to the further adventures of Louis Kincaid.
