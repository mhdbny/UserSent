This book details what John Kenneth Galbraith views as a "good society" with what can be achieved and admitting there are goals that can't realistically be reached.Mr. Galbraith observed that the percentage of the poor that don't vote is mirrored by the high percentage of rich that do vote.His view on wealth and power was insightful- "Power serves the acquisition of income; income accords power over the pecuniary reward of others." Page 65.His assessment of corporate greed was almost prophetic-"Personal profit maximization, that universally acclaimed motivation, can and does extend to those who effectively head the firm." Page 17.The downside with this book from one of my favorite authors on the subject of economics is the age of it.A lot has transpired in the world of politics, global business, and economics since this book was published in 1997.The book does serve very well as a primer on liberal economics.

Most of the cases detailed in this book are old cases that are either unsolved or with convictions that have some degree of doubt attached to them.The insights from John Douglas as a profiler are very interesting.The "Jack the Ripper" case is one of the most notorious of all time.Mr.Douglas explains why he would eliminate some the known,hypothetical suspects and settles on a probable suspect.He argues for the guilt of Lizzie Borden and I think that he's correct on that case.His assessment of the Lindbergh kidnapping is intriguing. "More than one individual took part in the crime that night"-page 180. Hauptmann was no doubt heavily involved but the case for the "dual intruder theory" makes sense.The "Black Dahlia" case was another savage murder and he lists two very strong possible suspects.I can understand how he arrived at his conclusion in the JonBenet Ramsey case. That case was hamstrung from the start with crime scene contamination and the well-known animosity between the police and DA's office. The presence of foreign DNA enforces the theory of an intruder.John Douglas will get slammed for his supporting of the Ramseys. Considering the victim and the unsolved status of that case,it's going to be an infamous topic for years to come.As a fan of true crime genre books I liked this book.

There is a lot of information in this book.The nature of Freemasonry makes proving or disproving the authors ideas impossible.I am not a Freemason.My interest in the subject relates to the "Jewish Mysteries" and ties to King Solomon and other Hebrew people.Afer reading this book Ifeel that King Solomon was influential on Freemasonry.I strongly disagree that Yehusha(Christ)participated in these secret societies.Some of the rites do mimic the crucifixion and resurrection.Which I find interesting.Mr.Leadbetter puts forth an interesting theory of who Hiram Abiff was.Was he in the Bible?He states that the death of Hiram Abiff was not as portrayed in masonic legend.He was a decorator rather than an architect.The masonic concept of the "trinity" of Osiris,Isis,and Horus parallels other sun worship cults.I disagree with the author's opinion on the Four Beasts found in Revelation and Ezekiel.He felt that those beasts correlate to four elements/four brothers of Horus.The problem with that is that there is no ape listed in the Four Biblical Beasts.I personally am convinced that the four beasts are related directly to the four brigade emblems of the Israelite tribes.Mr.Leadbetter discussed the double meaning of words,especially regarding "The Book of the Dead".The date of the "mourning the death of Osiris" in winter or the "slaying of the sun" by dark forces are close to those of Christmas celebrations today.Some of the most surprising ideas in this book are:*King Solomon built a temple for Astarte.*In Red Masonry there was a search for a hidden vault buried deep in the Earth in which was hidden the Name of God.*Festivals of two well-known patron saints-St.John the Baptist and St.John the Evangelist were celebrated.*Mention of Jachin and Boaz,the two pillars from Solomon's Temple.*The history and origin of the Knights Templar and their role as financiers.*Mr.Leadbetter wrote about some of the beliefs of early church fathers that if true,are disturbing.This is the second book I have read that makes similar claims of participation in the hidden mysteries.*His theory on the loss of the pronunciation of the sacred Name was wrong in my opinion.He believes that loss was accidental due to memory loss as a result of captivity.I don't believe that the scribes or High Priests ever lost memory of the Name.They hid it.While I don't agree with some of C.W.Leadbetter's theories,this book really does have a lot of history and general information on Freemasonry and related societies.This book provided me with some potential answers that I was looking for.I give it 4 stars for relevant content and readability.

The edition of "The Life and Times of Jesus Christ the Messiah" that I am reviewing is the third edition printed in 1995. It is a burgundy hard cover with gold lettering.This may be the most thorough,comprehensive book about the land and times of Jesus. It covers religious thought and politics of the day.What the Messianic expectations were.This is a very detailed and well-documented chronicle of the Messiah's life.The Appendices in the back of the book are the best I have read.Mr.Edersheim also covers such topics as:Pseudigraphic Writings-Enoch,Jubilees,Apocalypse of Baruch are some.Rabbinic views,theology,and literature.Lists of the Maccabees,Family of Herod,and Roman govt leaders.The Law in Messianic times.Jewish Angelology and demonology.The Jewish history of exorcisms was interesting.The Fall of Angels.Some very helpful tools also found in the back of this book are the Subject Index,Scripture Index,and maps.I have read "the Complete Works of Josephus". This book is much better in my opinion! It covers a lot more ground and would make a great reference tool.

The book reviewed here is a reprint of "the Apocalypse of Baruch" or "Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch". It's a smaller hard cover edition that is still available and reasonably priced if you look hard enough.Mr. Hoffman did an extensive review that is quite accurate.I would only add the following observations:The Index I in the back of the book is valuable in that it lists parallel passages from Scripture with the Apocalypse of Baruch,Ethiopic Enoch,Slavonic Enoch, and the books of 4 and 5 Ezra(Esdras?).One interesting passage in the book reads "Nevertheless,they hid all the vessels of the Sanctuary,lest the enemy should get possession of them." This gives some credence to the theory that Jeremiah hid these items.Also mentioned are "Leviathan" and "Behemoth".The footnotes are plentiful and informative.With the passage of time this book has been taken more seriously. Particular after the two World Wars and fulfillment of prophecies in the book.

The edition that I read was copyrighted 2007.This book subscribes to the historicist view of prophecy and Revelation.The author does an excellent job documenting the origin of Sunday worship.The Catholic church in it's own literature admits to changing the Sabbath to the veneral day of the Sun.This is explained in detail in this booklet.There is no scriptural basis for changing the Sabbath! On this point the book is correct.Dan.7:25 contains that prophecy.The book re-hashes some dubious history of the Catholic church;the Waldenses,strict penalties for owning a Bible,the Inquisition,etc...The definition and identification of the "Seal of God" and "Mark of the Beast" are interesting.The theory that the "Seal" is linked to the Sabbath makes sense when reading the Scriptures.The identification of the mother of harlots is not new,the identification of the "image of the beast" is a new one for me.Some of the points in this book are debatable however.Sacrificial law was indeed fulfilled by Yahusha's sacrifice. But that doesn't neccessarily translate into the seven Biblical festivals "no longer being required of us now". Zech.14:16 is an interesting passage regarding the Festival of Booths.The 666 math with the pope is highly questionable also.This book has a lot of Scriptural references and heavy quotations from Catholic literature. It is sure to upset many christians,Catholic and Protestant alike. There is a lot of truth in the pages,but some speculation also. The material on the Sabbath alone make this a book worth reading for anyone seeking the truth.

This is the author's first book. It's a good book to start with on the subject of customs/traditions of the Church.He really covers a lot of topics that most of us probbably never think about. Like the origins of the names of weekdays and months.Lew White gives us some history about Easter,Christmas,and Halloween.He compares Passover to the Last Supper.The Nephilim are discussed briefly.The quote from Epiphanius regarding the Nazarenes was enlightening.I was a little surprised when I read the excerpts from the denominational sources confirming Saturday as the Sabbath!The only complaint I have about this book is the small size of the print.I recommend this book as well as Mr. White's two other books.

George McGovern offers some solutions to restore America to greatness in areas such as; addressing terrorism, Israeli- Palestinian peace, relations with other nations, and restoring the image of our country after invading Iraq.The book included a great quote from Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson- "Wisconsin can get a new Senator, I can't get a new conscience." You aren't likely to read about any of today's Senators making that comment.One of Mr. McGovern's poignant questions was "where is the peace dividend?"After the cold war ended there was an expectation that defense spending would be reduced. As he states, it's not the burden of the military to export or spread democracy.His highlighting of the farewell addresses of both Washington and Eisenhower was used effectively to show a point.He questions why we don't trade with Cuba but we trade with China? Good question. It really makes no sense.I don't agree with Mr.McGovern on more than a few issues. Seperation of church and state is but one of them. His view of Woodrow Wilson is another.But McGovern explains his viewpoints eloquently, stating that he is a "straightforward patriot and a strong advocate of constitutional democracy."His concern with hunger is admirable as well as his concern for the American worker and family farmer.He proposes protecting the American worker from corporations that exploit cheap labor and bad working conditions with a possible closing of the American markets to those corporations."The Essential America" is well worth the read for it's common sense observations and ideas whether the reader is a Democrat or Republican.

Ann Rule has masterfully written about Ted Bundy, her friend who also lays claim to being one of the worst serial killers in history.She elaborates on her background in law enforcement as a former police officer with family in law enforcement. Another aspect that sets her apart from most true crime authors is her training in crime scene investigations and her participation in crime expert seminars.In a strange twist of irony the author had signed a contract to write a book about the murders with no hint that the killer was someone that she knew."The Stranger Beside Me" shows the contrasts in Ted Bundy- a very intelligent, politically connected seemingly charming man with a bright future and caring personality. Beneath all of that was a master conman and brutal murder fixated on a still unknown number of victims that fit a specific physical appearance. He was manipulative, thrived on media attention, and ultimately seemed to fear the end result that he meted out to his victims: death. He sure tried everything he could to avoid or postpone the death sentence he earned.What makes this book a true crime classic is the personal connection and insight that Ann Rule had with Ted Bundy. She tells the story not just as a writer, but an author that knew members of both sides of the investigation; the killer and many of the law enforcement members that worked the cases. An excellent book!

"Misbegotten Son" is the true story of Arthur Shawcross, a serial killer in New York state.Jack Olsen researched Shawcross from childhood to his incarceration for his serial murders. He included excerpts of the psychological/psychiatric interviews and the confessions.He was diagnosed as "mentally ill" at a young age. He tortured animals and exhibited other behavior believed to be indicators for potential serial killers. He was also diagnosed as "borderline retarded" and never seemed to have a conscience, sought attention frequently, had a violent temper, and was troubled in general.His first two murders were ghastly with children as his victims. He largely got off easily. Jack Olsen describes the circumstances that led to Shawcross not being charged for both murders. The D.A. rightfully lost his job over it.Mr. Olsen follows Shawcross's trail after parole where he eventually settled in Rochester,N.Y. That trail is an easy one to follow strewn with female corpses of his 11 victims. Shawcross brags that he cannibalized some of the bodies. He is a psycho-sexual sociopath that always had an excuse for something that triggered his murderous rage. The author readily disbunks the many mythical excuses upon investigation.Jack Olsen covered all of the angles from the killer, his family, wives and girlfriends, the victims and their survivors. Not least of the characters are some law enforcement personnel from Watertown and Rochester who worked hard pursuing justice in their cases."Misbegotten Son" is a very good true crime book that will probably leave the reader scratching his or her head and asking the unanswered question-Why?

"The I-5 Killer" is the story of Randall Woodfield, a multi-sport high school star who was drafted into the NFL after a successful college football career as a Wide Receiver.He had the same problem as Lance Rentzel of the Dallas Cowboys, a severe problem with exposing himself to young women. Unlike Rentzel, Randall Woodfield's behavior escalated to more serious activities like armed robbery and sexual assault. It's difficult to understand how that led ultimately to murder. The final number of murder victims may never be known.Woodfield has suggested that steroid use was a factor in his becoming aggressive.Ann Rule details the jurisdictional battles of law enforcement entities that were involved in the investigation. That battle may have been responsible for Woodfield's destruction of incriminating evidence in the interim.She also explains the evidence that originally tied him to the multiple crimes around the I-5 freeway in multiple states.The thinking behind California deciding not to prosecute the double-murder charges was explained.Randall Woodfield is a narcissist, totally wrapped up in himself and his "image". What's so puzzling is how someone with a popular social life and apparently normal family background could become a serial killer.Ann Rule tells the story of the I-5 killer in gripping style!

Edgar Goodspeed's translation of the Apocrypha is easy to read.These books were canonised at some point in history but later they were removed.The Apocrypha is not the same as "apocryphal" books that are of a dubious nature.The Introduction is very informational and the Preface was also helpful.Of the 14 books in this translation I appreciate the following books the most:*1st and 2nd Maccabees are Jewish history books covering the Maccabbean revolt.They are written by two authors and overlapping in time.The date for these books is around 312 B.C.*II Esdras is an apocalyptic book that has wisdom for everyday life. It also has Messianic prophecies and angelic visions.This book apparently has additions making it difficult to date.An example: 6:49 "Then you preserved two living creatures;one you named Behemoth;and the other you named Leviathan..."*The Wisdom of Sirach(Ecclesiasticus)is similar to Proverbs.Date is 180 B.C according to Mr. Goodspeed.A passage-8:7 "Do not exult over a man who is dead;Remember that we are all going to die."*The Wisdom of Solomon is another book similar to Proverbs.This book is dated roughly the first century B.C.An Example- 2:5 "For life is a fleeting shadow,And there is no way to recall our end,For it is sealed up and no one can bring it back."I recommend this book for extra-biblical and historical study.

WHAT THE BIBLE REALLY SAYS has an accurate assessment on the Bible being a "best seller that no one reads.""This curious state of affairs has inspired a whole series of new translations, all trying their best to make the venerable, familiar words of the Gospels keep pace with the 'living language.' This may not be the right way to go about it though; as new revisions and translations multiply, more and more questions are being raised about the linguistic accuracy of Scriptural verses that we have been familiar, if not always comfortable, with since childhood." Page 12.Another interesting quote was on page 305 regarding Messiah's birth-"The traditional date of December 25 was fixed by Pope Liberius in the fourth century. The date was a shrewd choice, because the Romans celebrated the ancient pagan festival of the winter solstice on the same day, which allowed the pagan celebration of the unconquerable sun to be absorbed by the Christian celebration of the triumphant Son of God."Mr. Barthel addressed some interesting Bible topics and offered some ideas on obscure items. Among them:-- A definition for "slime" used as mortar in Gen. 11:3.-- A corrected definition for the name Abraham.-- Identity of the "burning bush" seen by Moses.Some of the most pertinient information in this book in my opinion was the translational shortcomings of the King James Version.He demonstrates how a simple translational slip resulted in Moses having "two horns" in both the early latin Vulgate and the German Bible.He also dedicated some pages to explaining how the scribes approached the Sacred Name when they were transcribing texts.This book is outdated in one respect. As Mr.Barthel stated, the translation and publishing of the Dead Sea Scrolls was and continues to be, a work in progess. So there are more current books on that subject.Overall this book really falls somewhere between a 3 and 4 star rating in my opinion. Not a bad book.

The Modern Language Bible is a revision of the Berkeley Bible that Gerrit Verkuyl originally did.This Bible reads easily.The chronological dates are printed over some of the books and chapters.That is helpful as well as the modern equivalents of weights,distance,and money value.Two examples are Deut.3:11"Og king of Bashan was the last survivor remaining of the Rephaim,his bedstead was a couch made of iron 13 1/2 feet long and 6 feet wide."And a footnote on MT 26:15 "these pieces of silver were probably silver shekels equal in mid-twentieth century US currency to a little more than one dollar per shekel.Judas' price for betraying Christ was from thirty to thirty five dollars."That kind of puts things in a different perspective,a modern perspective.It is a lot easier to understand terms like feet rather than cubits or dollars as opposed to shekels.Another important aspect of this version is that it stays true to the Messianic promise and prophecies of the Old Testament.Subject Descriptions and Chapter numbers at the top of pages are nice for navigating this book.The footnotes are extensive and they are some of the better Bible footnotes that I have come across to date.This would make an excellent study Bible for anyone interested in a modern version of the Bible.As far as accuracy goes,the Modern Language Bible-New Berkeley Version is an accurate translation.

The Jerusalem Bible I am reviewing is the burgundy cloth,hard covered edition from 1966 edited by Alexander Jones.J.R.R. Tolkien was on the committee that worked on this version.This is the original edition and it's becoming harder to find.This is not to be confused with the "reader's edition" or New Jerusalem Bible.A few negatives on this Bible:it is cumbersome to carry.It is thick!Approximately 2 3/4 inches thick.And heavy.Now a review of what's inside the covers.My understanding of this version is that it was commissioned by the Catholic Church and it was the first departure from the Latin Vulgate or another words; there was a lot of investigating/studying the Greek and Hebrew texts.This Bible uses the name "Yahweh" instead of titles like "God" or "Lord" in the OT.There are educational Introductions to each book in this Bible.The Jerusalem Bible has 7 more books than the KJV has.They are:1 Maccabees, 2Maccabees, Judith, Tobit, Baruch, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus.The footnotes are exhaustive and very helpful for study.For example a footnote on Isaiah 7:14 describes the subtle difference between Greek and Hebrew for the description of Immanuel's mother as a virgin(Greek) or maiden,young girl,or recently married woman(Hebrew).The JB uses "maiden" in that verse where I would argue that it was a prophecy of the "virgin" birth.Matthew 6:13 uses the wording "put us not to the test" rather than "lead us not into temptation"in the Lord's Prayer. This wording is more in line with James 1:13 "Never, when you have been tempted, say,'God sent the temptation';God cannot be tempted to do anything wrong,and he does not tempt anybody."Another curious difference in text wording can be found in Rev.22:19.The KJV and older versions use the words "book of life".The Jerusalem Bible(and most modern Bibles) has "..God will cut off his share of the tree of life and the holy city..."There is a Chronological Table and Index of Biblical Themes at the end of this book.They are very helpful.The biggest value of the Jerusalem Bible is as a study Bible.The footnotes are excellent!I have found no doctrinal slant or bias in this Bible.It's a classic Bible and getting more difficult to find.It's a keeper in my library!

THE GUNFIGHTER MAN OR MYTH is a surprisingly complete look at the wild west. He goes beyond a study of gunfighters to the various bodies of lawmakers, the vices, guns and much more.On the subject of lawmen he covered the history and some adventures of the Texas Rangers, the Pinkertons, and the U.S. Marshals.The cowboys, cattle drives and the Texas Longhorn cattle were examined.Mr. Rosa had short essays on some of the prominent gunfighters from both sides of the law. Among those were the Earps, Wild Bill Hickok, John Wesley Hardin, Ben Thompson, and "Mysterious Dave" Mather.Another fascinating subject was the handguns that were so instrumental in the life and death of a gunfighter. He explored the manufacturers and the models they sold. What was even more interesting was the individual modifications some of the shootists used for safety or to enhance the use of their gun. He also addresses the reasoning for some of carrying more than one pistol.Among the myths that the author dispelled was the quick draw. It wasn't a normal part of a gunfight. Situational preparation and "deliberation" were under-rated factors. On page 180 Mr. Rose wrote; "Legend has made all the shootists appear much better shots than they were. But there can be no doubt that some of them were great pistol men."This book not only accomplishes the goal of separating the gunman from the myth, it educates the reader on other relevant topics in the life of the gunfighter. Also helpful are the footnotes to sources and the Index.I recommend this book.

Philip Carlo has written a very exhaustive book about the Night Stalker. It's hard to imagine a more complete book on the serial killer.The first portion of the book dealt with the horrible crimes of the Night Stalker.Following that was a section dealing with Richard Ramirez from birth all the way to his arrival in L.A. from El Paso. His temporal lobe epilepsy of childhood and the influence his cousin Miguel had on Ramirez when he was a pre-teen.The next section of the book was about his attempts to avoid arrest and his eventual apprehension by citizens.The last part gave a detailed summary of Ramirez's trial.What made the Night Stalker so dangerous was that he was a different breed of serial killer, he didn't victimize a certain type of person. He really didn't stalk his victims, he chose his targets at random from an ever-expanding area.Philip Carlo effectively connected the combinations of influences that fueled Ramirez's criminal drive;sex,drugs,pornography,heavy metal music,and satanism.He was a dedicated satanist reading books authored by Anton LaVey and even meeting him once.The strange,surreal actions by the Night Stalker "groupies" and Ramirez himself are reminiscent of the Charles Manson trial from "Helter Skelter".If you want to learn why the Night Stalker was arguably the most feared killer this is the book to read!

This quote is from the book-"If the truth be told,we Christians never seem to ask why we do what we do. Instead, we bithely carry out our religious traditions,never asking where they come from."One of the lessons taken from this book is that traditions can be blinding.Mark 7:8 has Messiah saying "Disregarding the command of God,you keep the tradition of men." That statement is still applicable today.Frank Viola does an exceptional job in detailing the history of various denominations. Two examples are: Protestant denominations reformed or revised the theology of Catholicism without returning to the practices of the first century believers.Anabaptists believed in every-member functioning in the body.That was more in line with the "early church."He also casts some light on the origins of:sermons,pile carpets and chairs in the building,the church building itself,stained glass windows.What I also found very interesting is the origin of the Bishopry and Apostolic succession.The "Sermon on the Mount" was not known as such untill Augustine called it that in AD 395.Mr. Viola has researched this subject well and there are extensive footnotes throughout this book.He exposes the un-Biblical practices of most churches.To understand this subject well,a reader has to understand who and what Constantine was. I found the information on the "early Church fathers" very educational.Two topics that I appreciate in this book that few authors will deal with are tithing(what it really was in the OT)and the art of "proof-texting". The latter is the common practice of using a verse to prove a point with no regard for the context of that particular verse.Chapter 11 was my favorite in the book. "Re-approaching the NT:the Bible is not a jig-saw puzzle" is reminiscient of another of his books that I recently read and reviewed.I wish that he would have dealt with the topic of Sunday worship vs the Sabbath.This book is well-written and very detailed. This is the 2nd book by Frank Viola I have read. Based on what I have read so far,I will be reading the other two shortly. This book can be an "eye opener" and I recommend it!

This book can be summed up with this true statement:"Consequently,if the Spirit of God were to leave an institutional church,His absence would go un-noticed."Mr. Viola makes some insightful points about the modern church."The early believers understood that God sanctifies people,not objects."Objects such as church buildings for instance.His points are good and backed up Scripturally. In James 5:14 the sick are told to call on the Elders for prayer. Not a Pastor or Priest.Note also that most of the Pauline epistles are addressed to communities.The author made a good point about the Lord's Supper's origin. What it really was originally is far from the Communion of today!He really makes a lot of good points in favor of house churches.

This is an early Ann Rule true crime story about Harvey Carignan who used the want ads to lure unsuspecting, young female victims.Ann Rule goes back to the cases in Alaska where Carignan beat a hanging sentence on a technicality.Carignan is a sociopath,but far from insane. He is intelligent and knows criminal law and constitutional rights well enough to have written papers on the subjects during an earlier stretch in prison.The author defines the difference between a sociopath and a psychotic.She mentions the possibility that Carignan may have been involved in the Piper kidnapping, although the evidence is weak.The maps with the interesting markings showing some known burial sites gives rise to the concern that he vented his hatred of women far more times than has been known. The numerous unexplained markings loosely match some unsolved murders with similar M.O. in areas that Carignan passed through. He may have been an earlier version of a roaming killer much like Tommy Lynn Sells. One difference between Carignan and other notorious serial killers is the physical nature of Carignan, he was large,muscular and didn't shy away from fights with men."The Want-Ad Killer" may not be Ann Rule's best book, but it is fast-paced and an interesting choice of subject in Harvey Carignan.

This book is an expose' into the Nugan Hand international bank and it's connections to the CIA.Jonathan Kwitny is a top-notch investigative journalist and he doesn't disappoint with "The Crimes of Patriots".Among the topics in the book:The origin of the "French Connection".Fraudulent enterprises such as Ocean Shores.The CIA's involvement in the overthrow of Australian Prime Minister Whitlam.A shared office building and secretary used by both Nugan Hand and the D.E.A.The work C.I.A. agents did for Muammar Qaddafi.Mr. Kwitny cites the work of Alfred McCoy on the "the Golden Triangle" and international heroin trade.He also covers money laundering operations, particularly for drug traffickers. Nugan Hand had to ba a C.I.A. asset!The author has frequent footnotes documenting the sources for specific information.The cast of characters includes some famous intelligence operatives, high ranking military officers, con artists, Air America pilots, and just about any other type of people you would expect in a best seller spy novel. But "The Crimes of Patriots" is nonfiction and very well done at that!

In "Shooting Straight" Wayne LaPierre analyzes the "buzz words" used by the gun control lobby.The most telling abuse of these words is "Assault Weapons".Mr. LaPierre quotes Josh Sugarman of the Violence Policy Center to reveal how the gun control lobby really works."Assault weapons are a new topic. The weapon's menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine-guns versus semi-automtic assault weapons. Anything that looks like a machine-gun can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons." - page 44.Deception and confusion are standard operating procedure.The author cites numerous statistics proving that crime rates increase with a disarmed population. That contrasts with lower crime rates in conceal-and-carry states. Crimonologists Gary Kleck and John R. Lott,jr are sources for that data."The point is clear, crime is irrelevant to the gun control lobby, control is the issue." The author quoted on page 66.The media bias in reporting on the conclusion of the shooting at Appalachian School of Law in 2002 is addressed. What the media widely ignored or censored was the fact that two armed students disarmed the shooter.John McCain's Campaign Finance Reform bill is analyzed as well as McCains' relationship with Americans for Gun Safety(AGS). AGS has no relationship to gun safety, it's a stealth approach at gun control.The myth that the government or police force must protect you is shattered by a D.C. Court of Appeals ruling in 1981 which reads in part, "a government and it's agents are under no general duty to provide public services such as police protection, to any particular citizen".As Mr. LaPierre accurately points out, the problem is not with laws. The problem lies in woefully inadequate enforcement and prosecution of federal laws! The common sense solution is enforcement of current laws and responsible gun ownership!One point of contention I have is one that was brought up by an earlier reviewer, that is the seemingly high number quoted for existing laws by the author."Shooting Straight-Telling the Truth About Guns in America" is just what the title implies, a straight forward book about the inalienable right of self-protection, responsible gun ownership, and the tactics used by the gun control lobby.

This book gives a lot of information about the worship of the sun/false gods in the Chaldean,Assyrian,Babylonian,Greco-Roman,and Medo-Persian cultures.Mr.Rives lists the names that these false gods were called by the various people that worshipped them.He explores where some of the modern church traditions came from. The holidays such as Easter and Christmas are examined.This book is literally "packed" with Bible quotes.The chapter on the Sabbath and it's history was excellent! Mr.Rives writes about his personal study and experiences regarding observing the Sabbath.The short chapter on early church history was concise and well-written.The chapter about Paul's letters and greek word meanings in the New Testament was well-done also.If you are looking for a detailed,Bible-based book about church traditions,I recommend this book!

This is Gary Moore's blues debut originally released in 1990.The most notable song is the title track.The blues lead on the song is easily recognized and this could be Moore's signature song. The vocals are as passionate as the guitar performance. It sounds like a barely perceptible sax and string section in the background. But make no mistake, this song is all about an inspired blues lead! The best song on this cd."Oh Pretty Woman" is an Albert King song with King also playing on this track.The twin leads are exceptional on a song that I favor out of Albert King's catalog.Moore's screaming,hard rock-inspired lead stands out while you can still here King's Flying V lead. An excellent performance all the way around."Walking By Myself" features a terrific harmonica in addition to more hard rock/blues licks.Gary Moore does another cover song justice with "Too Tired" accompanied by Albert King again. Another excellent lesson in blues guitar!"As The Years Go Passing By" is the forerunner to future blues ballads that would become a staple on later albums.This one is a cover originally written by either Don Robey or Peppermint Harris, depending on the source accepted. The most widely known version was that of Albert King.This track has a sad horn section and beautiful piano in addition to a lead guitar that is pure blues right down to the quivering bend of the strings."Midnight Blues" is another slow blues ballad with sorrowful lyrics and a guitar lead that conveys that sentiment."That Kind Of Woman" offers a horn section and a load of string-bending on the guitar before launching into a hard rock lead.As a Gary Moore blues fan I am biased to some extent but some of the songs that I don't personally view that highly are "All Your Love" and "Moving On". They just don't connect with me like most of his blues songs do.Debut albums often are seen as the pinnacle for an artist. Gary Moore is different in that his blues material got better through the years.I would argue thatBad for You Baby, his last studio album, is a stronger cd.After Hoursis another cd in my collection that I would rate higher.While this cd has a few songs that I would call "weak" it offers some excellent blues in the title track,"Oh Pretty Woman","Walking By Myself", "Too Tired","As The Years Go Passing By", and "That Kind Of Woman".True. This may not be popular with blues purists and some songs would not meet a strict definition of "blues", they are excellent anyway. And as artists like Joe Bonamassa are doing today by "pushing boundaries" for what is the blues, Gary Moore attempts that with this debut.The six songs that I listed favorably make this cd more than worth the purchase price which is quite reasonable on Amazon.

I normally don't care for fiction,but this book is an exception.It may be fiction,but it is based on fact and real people.This book offers a view of the politics of Disraeli's time and where political power really exists.Well written and recommended book!One caveat:I have the Penguin Classic paperback and I don't recommend this edition as the print is very small.Thomas Braun edited it with notes for each chapter.It would have been great if not for the print.

"Reformation and Society" begins as a study of the leaders and the reformation movements in countries like Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Britain to name a few.The Hussites, Thomas Cromwell, Stephen Gardiner, and William Tyndale are some of the notable sceptics of the papacy. Of course A.G. Dickens devotes more time to covering the better known trio of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin.The book examines some of the causes of the Reformation and the importance of universities and the printing press in fueling the reformation.A look at the societies of Luther's Germany and other countries involved in varying degrees to the movement.The influence that Thomas Wyttenbach had on Zwingli was interesting as was the failed attempt by Philip of Hesse to reconcile Luther and Zwingli. While the leaders of the Reformation had a common opponent in the Catholic church, their views were anything but universal.The author descibed the different beliefs of various sects of Anabaptism and their suffering at the hands of both Catholics and Protestants."Reformation and Society" was a useful read on the Reformation and it's effects on a number of countries and societies. The squabbles over different viewpoints such as the view of communion in relation to Christ's physical body. Various views on spiritualism were also examined.Overall an educational book well worth reading.

Having vivid memories of Jesse "the Body" Ventura ,professional wrestler, I expected a brash, highly opinionated book. I was surprised by the sensible,well-thought-out political positions and ideas in this book.I believe that he was 100% accurate in his 2000 assessment of George W. Bush as well as his statement that elected officials all too often serve the party instead of the people.The advantage for incumbents and the never ending campaign cycle for reelection are also valid observations.Jesse Ventura did provide some interesting ideas-unicameral state legislature,national sales tax(looks a lot like the Fair Tax of this current Presidential election season), 4 year term for Senators and Congressmen, tort reform, trade with Cuba, repealing the 16th Amendment.I don't agree with all of Ventura's positions, but he has a thoughtful, no-nonsense attitude about tackling the political problems that have only gotten worse since the printing of this book! A lot of his ideas are bold and worth a long look.

This book is very well researched.Mr.Hersh used the Freedom of Information Act and a lot of sources.Some of the info that was new to me was the serious,juvenile health problems that Jack Kennedy had.I hadn't read about his personal physician or the trouble that his Dr. had in the future.Mr.Hersh detailed Joe Kennedy's business ventures and lack of ethics.Especially his boot-legging.Startling events at the Democratic convention explain the strange choice of Lyndon Johnson as VP.There are a lot of assassination "players" mentioned in this book.He covered the corruption in the 1960 Presidential election.The chapter on Judith Exner and the suitcases highlighted John Kennedy's connection to Sam Giancana.JFK,like his father was a risk-taker and his womanising was a case in point.After reading this book,one has to wonder if his re-election would have been a success.The scandals likely would have been his downfall.If you want to read about the political intrigue of the Kennedy presidency this is the book to read!

"Forever a Chief" is the only book dedicated to the life and career of Kansas City Chief Linebacker Derrick Thomas that I am aware of.This book consists of quotes from Mr. Thomas and NFL players and coaches, some full page action photos,(there are a few photos of D.T. in uniform for his last game) and career achievements from both on and off the field."On the field accolades are great, but in order to reach your full potential, you have to overstep the boundaries of football and go out into the community and be an All-Pro there too." -Derrick Thomas.A large part of his legacy is his involvement in the community and especially with the youth.In an NFL career that was too short, the late Derrick Thomas achieved the single-game sack record, impacted the outcome of games with his K.C. Strip (sack and chop)technique, and put up fantastic sack totals at Alabama.Derrick Thomas set up the Third and Long Foundation and some of the proceeds from the sale of this book go to that foundation.It's difficult to fully cover the player and more importantly, the man that Derrick Thomas was. This book as a pictorial tribute is a very good one.

In Sands of Empire Robert Merry begins the book with information about various political philosophy such as "the idea of progress" and "cycles of history" and related how that has affected American foreign policy.He also looks at the role of the media elite on war decisions.Some of the history between Henry Kissinger and the neoconservatives was quite interesting.On page 167 Mr. Merry observes about the neoconservative support of both sides of a policy-"The answer once again is that these restless intellectuals have a tendency to make their way to whatever watering hole they can find to quench their need for a rhetorical argument of the moment."The author also brings up the point that among the colossal mistakes made by Bush II in his foreign policy was that the decision makes didn't understand the enemy or the culture factor.A good book on modern American wars and where Bush made his biggest errors. Mr. Merry also discusses the ideological sources for those who led the way.

This book was written after Deacon Jones ninth season with the Rams.Bill Libby starts the book with the Rams-Colts game of December,1967.He follows that up with the chidhood of David "Deacon" Jones in Eatonville,Florida during a time before racial integration.The author explains the improbable circumstance of Deacon's draft selection in the 14th round by the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams looked at more potential rookies than most pro teams did in those days and they accidentally discovered Deacon Jones while viewing film of an opposing player.Deacon shares with the author his experiences as a rookie and an unquenchable desire to succeed, even playing offensive tackle for a brief time in his rookie campaign.Some of the best parts of this book are the quotes.Deacon shares some thoughts on his play-"Second effort is a lot of it. And my speed which enabled me to get back in plays which had gone by me, or to catch up to plays that had gone the other way. Pressure is the secret.""I play for money, but I also play for pride. It's a challenge being the best. I don't mind being an example. I dig being a hero."Some of the statements about Deacon as an opponent were highly respectful."No man I've ever faced had his quickness, his speed, or his moves. He could outrun any back we had." - Forrest Gregg, Packers Hall-of-Famer.Another enjoyable insight was what Mr. Jones thought of some of his contemporaries; especially stars like Gale Sayers, Dick Butkus, Mike Ditka, Johnny Unitas, Bart Starr, and Ray Nitschke.His teammates also held him in high regard. Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier, George Allen are a few who contributed statements for the book.Deacon described his support of Bobby Kennedy's candidacy and another off-the-field topic was his career as an entertainer.I really enjoyed "Life in the Pit". It's a very well done biography of one of the most colorful players who also revolutionized his position in the game of pro football.

"Reclaiming the American Right" is an investigation into the evolution of the conservative movement. What went wrong in the movement can best be answered by reexamining the movement's past.WWII and the Viet Nam wars introduced a different kind of "conservative" into the conservative movement. The original conservatives were non-interventionists. This era found some of these new "conservatives" were internationalists or globalists. That's where the change became very evident. Even today the branding of some conservatives as isolationists is disingenuous. A point Mr. Raimondo effectively makes clear is that this tag is used rather than a more accurate word- nationalist.In the Introduction the author addresses the changes resulting from the "co-optation" and "corruption" of what today could be called the Old Right. Rather than favoring nationalism or "America First" like the Old Right of Taft, Garrett, Flynn, and today's Pat Buchanan; neoconservatives favor a global empire with as much defense spending as they can get.On page 30 Mr. Raimondo addressed globalism and the neocon buzzphrase "exporting democracy"."This is the new myth in the name of which the world-savers and world planners empty our wallets and fill their coffers; the new rationale for the existence of countless think-tanks and the cushy jobs that go with them; the latest code word for a frankly imperial policy, unrestrained by either modesty or common sense."He contrasts the priorites that have changed. The Old Right emphasized individual rights and property rights where today the key word is "democracy."This edition was published in 1993. I am surprised by how vividly some of the Old Right quotes from more than 50 years ago have summed up the politics of today."The Washington of the nineties is ruled, not by Congress, or even the President, but by the lobbyists of every group aspiring to victimhood, competing to rob the taxpayers blind."- page 240. Sound accurate for today? I think so.A Samuel Francis quote addresses what needs to be done to reclaim the original conservative movement(there was a conservative movement before Bill Buckley,jr. and National Review). "In short, what is needed, says Francis, is a populist revolt. Not a movement of intellectuals directed at the elite, not an attempt to preserve what has already been destroyed, but a grassroots movement against the welfare-warfare state."Some more topics that the author covers in the book are:*He identifies the first neoconservative.*The origin of the New World Order concept.*The European influence on American domestic policy.*Chronicles the evolution of the left-wing anticommunists of the fifties and sixties to the neoconservatives of the seventies and eighties.*He devotes a lot of pages to Garet Garrett and his books. The "Rise of Empire", published in 1952 was way ahead of it's time! The material on Garet Garrett alone make this book indispensable.*Garrett's view that the federal income tax was nothing less than power to redistribute wealth and assume power over money. That is an important component of imperialism.*Why the word "isolationist" is a straw man argument and always was.One motivating factor for my interest in this book was the short recommendation of the book by Ron Paul on this Amazon page.I wasn't disappointed. The author has written an honest, unbiased book about the old conservative movement and some of it's prominent figures.I would rate this book higher than 5 stars if that was possible!

Mr. Bacchiocchi shares how his father discovered the seventh day Sabbath. Both the author's and his father's background are not what one would expect.The first chapter of DIVINE REST FOR HUMAN RESTLESSNESS is an in-depth study of the various theories regarding the origin of the Sabbath.Mr. Bacchiocchi also takes a look at church history and some of the conflicts and contradictions revolving around the Sabbath.On page 101 he states what should be a fundamental point- "The believer who accepts God as his Creator must accept also what God has created and not change it into something else."His assessments of the Sabbath as a unique symbol were particularly full of insight. "It is unique because it is not an object or a place accessible only to a few, but a day(time)available to all. Five times in the Scripture the Sabbath is designated as a 'perpetual covenant' or a 'sign' between Yahweh and his people."-page 109.The author analyzes the seven day Sabbath and Sunday worship from a number of intelligent angles.Among some questions answered as a result are;Was attending a regular religious assembly explicitly part of the Fourth Commandment?Where did Sunday worship originate?The one subject that I find debatable is the actual day of Yahushua's (Jesus) death.Another statement from the author that struck me as invaluable was this on page 183- "The story of the Bible is the story of the struggle between true worship and false worship."DIVINE REST FOR HUMAN RESTLESSNESS is a deep, comprehensive study of the Sabbath with numerous notes for documentation.The dissertation FROM SABBATH TO SUNDAY which serves as an Appendix near the back of the book was my favorite part.If you are looking for a deep study of the Sabbath, I recommend this book.

While some of Newton's theories regarding Daniel and Revelation were very good, the inclusion of Latin text was a major disappointment for me!If you are a layperson like myself,the Latin serves no purpose.Now if a reader can read Latin, that may be a plus for them.There were however, some highlights in the book that I gleaned.Mr. Newton connects the four living creatures(in Newton's day they were referred to as "beasts")of Ezekiel and Revelation to the 12 tribes of Israel. He recognizes the faces of the creatures as symbols employed by the tribes in their encampment standards.Judah- a Lion, Ephraim- a Bull or ox, Dan- an Eagle, Reuben- a Man. On page 132 he wrote,"Whence were framed the heiroglyphicks of cherubims and seraphims to represent the people of Israel."He defines the differences between cherubim and seraphim.The author also provides a thoughtful argument against Antiochus Epiphanes being the horn in Daniel.Like Uriah Smith and others, he identifies the little book in Revelation as the sealed book from Daniel.For any reader looking to study a historicist view of Daniel and the Revelation of John, I would recommend "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation" by Uriah Smith as a much better choice.

Mark green draws on his experience as a mayoral candidate in New York city to expose what's wrong with elections at many levels of government.Enron is used as a prime example of money buying policy. Ken Lay was a large contributor to G.W. Bush in elections as Texas Governor and President. These contributions opened the door for Lay's participation on Cheney's energy task force. The author also traces the connection between Bush and Ken Lay evident in the crossover between Enron and presidential appointments.Along those same lines, Mr. Green cites California's experiences as an example of why energy deregulation was ill-advised. Monopolistic prices resulted.In a quote from page 181 the author describes some of the benefits reaped by corporate contributions. "The return on it's investment that the energy industry was seeking in the mid-1990's was deregulation."The battles over campaign finance reform and various court decisions were highlighted. Soft money often becomes addictive for incumbents. It provides a built-in advantage that challengers normally can't overcome.The Gramm-St.Germain bank deregulation bill was mentioned. That's more than relevant for today with the Wall Street bailout!Mr. Green details how lobbyists for big oil, energy, and pharmaceutical companies pay for beneficial legislation.While the author spends a lot of time on what is wrong with our government, he does offer some promising ideas that states are pursuing. One state is Rhode Island where free airtime has been mandated on public television and community cable for all candidates that participate in the public funding program. Britain has some interesting ideas also. In 2001 the British gave free airtime on public and commercial television for political parties. They also banned political commercials.On the subject of free airtime he has this quote from Warren Buffett- "We should require broadcast stations- the benficiaries of incredibly valuable licenses, courtesy of your federal governement- to make available, prior to every election, modest amounts of time for political discourse. Let's add an ability to be heard to a right to speak.""Selling Out" is an eye-opening book about what's wrong with national politics and to some extent, state and local politics as well. It's well-written and has sensible solutions to open up Amercian politics to every potential candidate instead of protecting the incumbents and special interest groups that have overtaken/bought our republic.

James Kugel states that the purpose of this book is " to offer a detailed look at how the Bible was interpreted in antiquity, to show what the Bible essentially was in that period."The period in question was the closing century B.C. to the first few centuries A.D.Most of the material in THE BIBLE AS IT WAS relates to the Pentateuch or Torah. He covers some of the mysterious aspects of those books. Some of those subjects were:When were angels created? Where was the garden of Eden located?What was Nimrod? Who buried Moses?These are some of examples of the many subjects the reader will find in the book.I found this book to be fascinating and the author did a fantastic job of examining more than one perspective. He used both Jewish and Christian sources to look at various different interpretations of Scripture. He showed some subtle differences between the Septuagint and Hebrew.Terms and Sources is a helpful resource tool. You can read a description of some interesting, ancient literature.The 35 page Index of Scripture passages and other literature was another feature that I appreciate.This is the best Scripture-related book that I have read in a long time. I bought two copies so I could pass one around. I definitely will read it again at some point.

This review is for the book authored by George Jowett,pictured in this listing.Mr.Jowett gives some interesting information about Joseph of Arimethea.He tells who he was,beyond being Mary's uncle.The "Bethany Group" was with Joseph of Arimethea when he went to Britain.This book covers the Disciples as well as Mary,James the just,Paul,and Peter. Where they traveled and their martyrdom.Aristobulus and after him,Paul traveled to Britain.This is also a detailed history of Britain and the subject of the "Lost Sheep".There is also a helpful index in the back of the book.This is a good book on the subject of the Disciples and what became of them.

This wireless desktop has some nice features.The keyboard is great.Not big,but it's not too small either and the keys are responsive and fairly quiet.The mouse fit nicely in my hand and was one of the better mice that I have used.It's also light in weight.The mouse recharging dock doubles as a reciever.Installation was easy.Turn off the pc,plug in the reciever,start up,and wait for Windows XP to recognise the new hardware.The biggest flaw that I found is the lack of an AC adapter for the rechargeable mouse dock.This would work great on a computer that's always on.If you are on dialup and shut your computer off between uses,this recharging system without the AC adapter will not charge your mouse enough.

I have been reading some primers on Kabbalah and most of those books are difficult to understand for a reader that is not well versed in Judaism.This book has been the exception.The best attribute of this book is that the author explains the sefirot in understandable terms. The connections and combinations of the sefirot are discussed effectively also.The Tree of Life diagrams were very helpful.The meditative visualizations have been an aid in calming the mind.The Glossary is excellent for explaining terms on the subject and the notes for each chapter are also very helpful.While this book is easy to understand its also one of those books that you need to keep handy and re-read it to fully appreciate the material in it.I wouldn't categorize this book as a "primer", its more detailed.I also recommend this book for a reader of any persuasion that wants to know what Kabbalah is and how it applies to everyday life in this age.

This book is dated,but I'm not so sure that any other book on the subject is better.Mr. Davis exposes the numerous links the Marcello family had to other key conspirators in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.Lee Harvey Oswald,Jack Ruby,and David Ferrie all knew each other and had Marcello family connections.Another highlight of this book is the contrast of the New Orleans mafia and other families.They operated quite differently than say,the New York or Chicago mob.The culture of that area was much like Sicily.Mr. Davis gives details on the extent of the corruption and political power enjoyed by Carlos Marcello.The transcripts of recorded conversations from the sting by the FBI reveal a lot regarding who was bought.Some major political figures are mentioned.The details of Carlos Marcello's deportation clarify the animosity between the mafia and the Kennedy brothers.The egos on both sides of the law were factors in the eventual assassination.The monumental part that J. Edgar Hoover played in the coverup and possible motivation for doing that are explained very well in this book.In the end of the book Mr. Davis briefly covers some of the books that were contemporary with his.The only thing he doesn't do is name the actual trigger men.This book is available and inexpensive.It's a book I highly recommend for anyone wanting to study the assassination of JFK.

In "The Murkin Conspiracy" Philip Melanson makes a lot of valid points about the weakness of the government's case against James Earl Ray as the murderer of Martin Luther King,Jr."The fingerprint evidence is not nearly as extensive or conclusive as HSCA's final report makes it appear."-page 100. That quote references the committees selective use of experts. Two of the three experts found no fingerprints from Ray on the rifle.The committee also relied heavily on the inconsistent eyewitness statements from an alcoholic boarder.The author summed it up quite well on page 84-"In reaching it's conclusion concerning Ray's guilt and his modus operandi,HSCA tended to oversell the evidence,glossing over inconsistencies and gaps in order to achive an investigative closure."What really makes it hard to pinpoint the shooter's location is the uncertainty of King's body position.It's also obvious that at least one government agency was surveilling MLK. There is evidence that some of his personal documents(receipts,notes,slips) were "aquired" and that the F.B.I. wasn't the only agency involved in those type of activities.Some of the questions that may weigh on a reader's mind in the book:Where did James Earl Ray get the Canadian aliases that he used before going to Canada?What was exchanged between Ray and the "fat man" in Toronto?Who was Kimble?Why did the police presence at the crime scene collapse so conspicuously?You will find some theories in answer to these questions."The best evidence suggests that Ray was an unexceptional criminal who had exceptionally clever help."-page 125.This book is a worthwhile read about the assassination of Martin Luther King,Jr.

This is the only Torah Commentary that I have bought thus far.After reading the reviews and finding a great price on the H/C in Amazon Marketplace I bought it.It is hard for me to imagine a better commentary on the Five Books of Moses! I may add more Torah commentaries to my library, but this one will always have a home for my Torah studies.The print is large enough for easy reading.Everett Fox uses the Hebrew names throughout the book.He points out that most English translations convey the idea of the text and translate out the sound. I appreciate the amount of information this commentary provides. An example is the subject of Moshe's physical appearance in Exodus 34:29. Mr. Fox footnotes an alternative meaning. The footnotes are plentiful and most of all, helpful.The Translator's Preface is well done and explains the background of this translation.I really like the Introductions to each book.Another feature that I appreciate is the Guide to the Pronunciation of Hebrew Names. This is very helpful if you are like me and know little Hebrew. The Hebraic thought in Torah makes this commentary so much more vibrant than what you would read in a standard English rendition of Torah in most modern Bibles.This book is a refreshing read and I highly recommend it!!

This is an updated review of George Lamsa's Holy Bible.The back cover lists some key passages and the difference in the KJV vs. this book.Most notable is the rendering of Matthew 6:13 "And do not let us enter into temptation,but deliver us from evil." rather than "And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil."The idea of God "leading us into temptation" conflicts with James 1:13.1 passage that I use to compare for differences in text is Revelation 22:19. The KJV uses the "book of life" whereas Lamsa(and most others)use the "tree of life."I John 5:7-8 is another passage to check out. Verse 8 in the KJV has the addition "testify in heaven,the Father,the Word,and the Holy Spirit,these three are One.And there are three who bear witness on earth."The Lamsa Bible has the correction "And there are three to bear witness,the Spirit,and the water,and the blood,and these three are one."Those are the positive aspects of this translation.Conversely,the rendering of I Samuel 6:19 is questionable.Depending on what translation you read the number of men at Beth-shemesh smote by the Lord can be from 70 to 50,070. Mr.Lamsa renders the number 5,070.There is at least one passage that was definitely altered to mirror Mr. Lamsa's doctrinal beliefs. Compare his rendering of Matthew 8:28-32 with other translations.The demon-possessed become "lunatics" and cast out becomes "heal" in Lamsa's translation.I have compared that passage with other translations that I have and also online English versions from the Aramaic such as the Etheridge and Murdoch translations. Mr. Lamsa is the only translator that has changed the wording of that passage as far as I can find to date.While George Lamsa casts helpful light on idioms, the difference in his translation while comparing it to other Aramaic based translations is troubling to me.

"Nemesis" is the last book in Chalmers Johnson's inadvertent trilogy.It is a critical examination of U.S. foreign policy and particularly the G.W. Bush mistakes. Mr. Johnson exposes the starkly unsuccessful record of our interventionist forays into foreign countries. The result is usually not a democracy, but a dictatorship.The concept of Command Responsibility-the doctrine that a military commander is legally liable for all abuses and atrocities by his troops whether he knows about them or not is interesting considering recent U.S. history. The author provides a history of the application of the concept and how far up the chain of command that it can go.There is a lesson on the Roman Empire and it's transformation over time form a democracy to a military dictatorship contrasted with the British Empire and how their democracy survived because of decreasing their military size and reach.The costly, clandestine, illegal ventures of Charlie Wilson are used as an example of "off the books" CIA activities. The author describes some of Clinton's experiences with the CIA and his mistrust of their intelligence information.The Council of Europe's report on illegal CIA "renditions" as an international violation of human rights was sobering. How many citizens are aware of these operations?Another subject that was enlightening is the critical view of Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) from the host country's vantage point. The alarming rate of increase in the 90's of these agreements further validates the author's point of American imperialism/empire building.Chalmers Johnson detailed the military-industrial complex's profit at taxpayers' expense on SDI(Star Wars space defense shield) and how it all too predictably evolved into an equally wasteful space weapons plan. The ridiculous idea that the United States "is an attractive candidate for a 'space Pearl Harbor'" is further evidence of the use of the fear-mongeringto precipitate funding for another absurd weapons program."Nemesis" spotlights the battle for secrecy that is all too obvious with Bush II. The actions regarding the FOIA by Cheney and Rumsfeld in the Ford Admninistration are not surprising."In theory, given our Constitution, we should not need a Freedom of Information Action."-page 245.The Bush "signing statements" are aptly described as illegal line-item vetoes."Nemesis" drives home the point that all empires eventually over-extend themselves and face a harsh choice for survival. Remain a military dictatorship like Rome and pass from the world scene or sacrifice military global dominance for survival as a democracy. Right now U.S. foreign policy emphasizes global dominance rather than national defense.Chalmers Johnson is the best author on foreign policy I have read to date. I highly recommend his books.

In THE DISPOSABLE AMERICAN Louis Uchitelle looks at labor history and layoffs.From something negative and to be avoided it has become part of business in general. A necessary evil.Mr. Uchitelle interviews different employees that were making career changes either due to being layed off or voluntarily changing jobs to avoid a possible lay off.One of the aspects that he discusses is the psychological affect of being layed off.Some of the subjects ring true for me. Getting layed off and finding another job at lower pay. It's more common than I initially thought!I have the experince of attending a job seminar where layed off employees are encouraged to pursue subsidized re-training. That's the concensus solution, get re-trained and pursue another job. What doesn't get disclosed often is that people that are re-trained usually work in a lower paying job initially. The author is on target when he wrote about that subject.Mr. Uchitelle explains quite clearly why the government statistics on unemployment are inaccurate. There are actually more people unemployed than the government numbers suggest.He also examines some of the political views of layoffs, particularly in the Reagan and Clinton administrations.Mr. Uchitelle does offer some sensible solutions to the epidemic of layoffs.I found the book worth reading if for no other reason than that I found there are a lot of people out of work or adjusting to a new career that made a lot more money than I ever did. It's not just employees in manufacturing that are being displaced or replaced.

Edna Buchanan has written a multi-faceted book about many of the crimes in Miami and the nearby area from her career as a crime reporter for local newspapers.She wrote about her childhood and the journey that led her to journalism.The author related how publicity usually aids in solving cases and apprehending the guilty,but not always. The "Pillowcase Rapist" was used as an example where that tactic failed.Victims are not always located. Like in the case of Christopher Wilder where two of his victims' bodies were never discovered.The disappearance of a 17 year old girl was an unsolved mystery. The poignant story of her mother's courageous search in dangerous locales and her timeless determination was another side to that story.Edna Buchanan documented the carnage of the race riots that resulted after the McDuffie police brutality-murder case.There are a number of true life,colorful characters in "The Corpse had a Familiar Face" that make this book entertaining and hard to put down.

As with all of his books,Steve Wohlberg bases his material on Scripture while considering the context.Although I found a few ideas that I disagree with.I believe that 144,000 are actually physical descendants of the 12 tribes rather than a spiritual group or the church.He has a very good point regarding his concept of the 144,000 "not being defiled by women" (Rev.14:4).Mr. Wohlberg offers a very clear,contextual,Scripture-based refutation of a third temple.He gives 10 points that provide logical,convincing evidence that the "one week" prophecy has already been fulfilled in the past. Another words,there is no suspension in the 70 weeks prophecy in Daniel."The entire seven year period of great tribulation is a grand illusion."-page 47.Jesus(Yahushua) was the one that caused sacrifice to cease. Not the antichrist. I believe that he is correct. As well as the idea that the "restrainer" of II Thess.2:5,6 was not the Church,but actually the Roman Empire's Caesars.His material on the "Law" came very close to validating Torah! It's more than just the 10 Commandments,excluding,of course,the sacrificial laws.I appreciate Steve Wohlberg's points of view as a Jewish man who is a Christian author. "Exploding the Israel Deception" is a good book for Bible-based end times prophecy and I recommend it.

In "The Antichrist Chronicles" Steve Wohlberg uses Scripture to refute the pre-trib rapture theory.He addresses the sources of the preterist and futurist theology.They both are products of the Jesuits(Francisco Ribera and Luis de Alacasar)and the Council of Trent.This was part of the "counter-reformation",a reponse to Martin Luther and other leaders of the reformation.A central part of this book pertains to the thoughts of the Protestant Reformers concerning the papacy and prophecies."Historicism is the belief that the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation find fulfillment throughout the history of Christianity."-from the book."Historicism recognises 'the falling away' that Paul predicted."-also from the book.This is the "falling away" found in II Thess.2:1-3.This is a good book,especially if you want to read about historicism and the differences between it and futuristic theology.

The book reviewed here is the orange paperback some of the other reviewers mentioned.This book comes off quite bizarre in some of the added details to OT Scripture.One example is "Adonizek King of Jerusalem,the same was Shem." (Chapter 16:11). This Adonizek sounds a lot like Melchizedek of Hebrews 7:1-3. The setting is identical,following Abram's victory in Genesis 14. I have heard the theory that this King/High Priest was Shem. The problem with this is that Shem has a genealogy(Gen.6:10) while Melchizedek doesn't(Heb.7:2-3).There is a lot more information in this book regarding Nimrod and his death,the death of Og King of Bashan,the life of Enoch,and the sons of Jacob.This book purports to give more details to the Old Testament,but are these additions fact or fiction? The answer is probably a bit of both with some passages being exaggerations of fact.I am sure that there was indeed a "Book of Jasher" as mentioned in the Bible. Is this it? I am not convinced that this book is the genuine article.

Antonia Juhasz has done her research well and produced a book that every concerned citizen should read.If you want to understand the real agenda of the Bush administration, this is the book with the explanations!The author details how Bush & Co. took advantage of 9/11-"It was pure imperial ambition, which the advocates of the Bush Agenda had been waiting for decades to implement." From page 19.The foreign policy was a specific unification of military and corporate globalization to forge a weapon of empire.It's not difficult to see who benefits from the Bush Agenda. Look at Bush and Co. and where they were employed before 2000 for a start.The Bush Agenda has three pillars; oil, war, and building the infrastructure for corporate globalization.On page 183 Ms. Juhasz observes of the Bush & Co."The corporations, the neoconservatives, and the George W. Bush administration are three interlocking groups with fluid demarcations."She shows many examples of war profiteering. Halliburton's dubious record of fraud is a prime case.Ms. Juhazs shares a very popular opinion of the Bush reign- it was a failure for everyone except the people who drafted it, the multinational corporations and the executives.This is one of the best books I have read on this subject. I highly recommend it!

THE CROSS AND ITS SHADOW is not a typical study of Messiah and salvation.Mr. Haskell obviously did a lot of research on Old Testament sacrifices involving the temples and the tabernacle.This is the third book written by Stephen Haskell that I have read and I find this to be the best. Scripture passages are found on every page. The difference with this book is that there are no columns with Scripture printed out.At the end of each chapter The author provided Type vs. Antitype comparisons of the subject. Some of those subjects for comparison were; The Biblical Feasts, the Sanctuary, the Priesthood, Levitical Laws and Ceremonies.On page 45 Mr. Haskell wrote "The broken law contained in the ark was the only reason for all the sacrificial services, both typical and antitypical."On page 88 he described the use of the Urim and Thummim to discern the will of God. His description was the best I have read to date.His commentary on the placement of the throne in Daniel 7:9 in view of customs of the time was exceptional. It offers a deeper meaning of "placing the throne."Mr. Haskell offered the following comment on James 2:17- "If we have a living faith, we shall gladly do as the Lord directs." Page 221.On the 12 tribes he observed on page 287- "as names of the twelve divisions of the one hundred forty-four thousand, there must be something in the character of Jacob's sons and of the twelve tribes worthy of study." He examined the significance found in the meaning of their names, Jacob's prophecies, and their actions in the Old Testament and known history.Mr. Haskell appears to interpret Scripture differently than I do on two subjects.The first being that he advocates controlling one's appetite on the day of Atonement where Leviticus 23:27 commands "you must fast".On observing Atonement he states " but it does not follow that on the antitypical day of Atonement no one should attend to personal business. For God never intended His people to 'be slothful in business'".Leviticus 23:28 states that "you shall do no work".All things considered, this book could be very beneficial for an understanding of the depth of Messiah's sacrifice from a variety of comparative symbols. When researching Hebrew priestly ordinances and the sacrifices in the tabernacle and temples new perspectives come to light. Especially when comparing Messiah with the High Priests!

I found this book surprisingly interesting.A book that spends quite a bit of time on food? Even the culinary aspect was written well. Ever wonder who invented ice cream?MIDNIGHT IN SICILY covers various aspects of Sicilian life- the culture, geography, people, and the crime.The mafia in the U.S. has nothing on the Cosa Nostra of Sicily.Mr.Robb provides quite a bit of material on the tangled web of Cosa Nostra: Michele Sindona and finances;the vatican and Sindona; American connections; drug money; blackmail; international intrigue; and government corruption. It's all in this book.It reads like a great crime novel. Only it's better than that! MIDNIGHT IN SICILY is a history book about a fascinating place and people.

I like Corey Stevens earlier albums."Blue Drops Of Rain" is his best work and "Road To Zen" while not quite as good, was a solid album. That was the motivation to buy this cd."Albertville" is a tribute to the man who heavily influenced rock and blues, Albert King.With so many King songs to choose from I wonder why "Oh Pretty Woman" didn't make it?"Nice To Be Nice" has some really good blues lead on it.Stevens' treatment of "Blue Suede Shoes" was actually very good. I wasn't thrilled with the inclusion of that worn out song until I listened to it. His style of play pumped life into that song.The musicians Corey Stevens chose for this album were great too! The sound quality is top-notch in my opinion.I rate this cd slightly lower than "Blue Drops Of Rain" but, I like it overall.I enjoy Corey Stevens style of blues guitar and his vocals. My taste is normally more oriented towards Les Paul guitar blues players. Stevens is one of the few current strat players that I like.This is a quality blues cd and worth picking up.

RHINESTONE COWBOY is the biography of Glen Campbell written by Tom Carter.This is more of an authorized biography as Mr.Campbell was the primary source. It's an honest self-assessment of Glen Campbell's mistakes and shortcomings.The book begins with the Campbell family from Billtown, Arkansas.They were a large,poor share-cropper family. His parents were a monumental influence on his life.Glen Campbell's start in music was documented as well as his naivete and the instances where he was too trusting in his gigs.The behind-the-scenes politics, writers, and general workings of both his own T.V. program and that of the Smothers Brothers Show was interesting.Where he got some of his songs was another area of interest. He identifies the writer of Rhinestone Cowboy, one of his "career songs".Mr. Campbell exposed his drug and alcohol addictions. He had a setback in 2003, so the road to recovery in the book wasn't final.This book puts a human perspective on the country music star and his struggles.RHINESTONE COWBOY is a book worth reading for any Glen Campbell fan.

This book is a chronicle of the life of Richard Kuklinski, the subject ot the "Ice Man" HBO documentaries.A brief look at his parents and childhood may explain some of what made the man such a dangerous psycopath.Watching some of the HBO documentaries sparked my interest in the "Ice Man". He didn't come across as a crazy man.This man was arguably the most dangerous of all killers. He was on one hand a freelance contract killer and also a serial killer who stalked his prey on Manhattan's West Side. He had no conscience or remorse.His ability to remain anonymous for so long helped him go undetected.Another trait that made him so dangerous was his holding a grudge. He had patience and would wait years for an oppurtuinty to get revenge.He was a paradox also. He had a violent temper and was prone to hurting people or worse for a minor incident such as road rage. But he had compassion for children. He wouldn't kill a woman or child,although he would harm women with impunity.The distance that he tried successfully for so many years to keep his family away from his illegal activities was not the norm either. As a couple Kuklinski and his wife didn't associate with mob couples much at all.One point of contention in the book was Kuklinski's stated involvement in the Hoffa murder. The scenario advanced in this book is somewhat similar to the story found in the Frank Sheeran book. Although Frank "the Irishman" Sheeran gave a more detailed description of the events and is more credible in my opinion.This book is hard to put down,but bear in mind that there are a lot of disturbing,gory details.

Contrary to some reviewers on this book, mine will be an unbiased review. I am not an Adventist or an Adventist basher.While THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN was originally written in the 1880s, the topics remain relevant for today.One of the major topics that runs throughout the book is the Biblical Sabbath, or seventh day Sabbath(Saturday).Mrs. White used a large number of Catholic sources for quotes to expose the origin of Sunday worship.This book also addressed church history and provided brief sketches of some of the Reformation leaders and martyrs throughout history.Her treatment of Luther could be viewed as "generous". She accented the positive and didn't delve into the dark side of Luther.In writing about Tyndale she discussed Bible translations and some of the related inaccuracies.Mrs. White also identified the "mystery of iniquity" that Paul wrote of in II Thessalonians 2:7.The "Historical Dating of Chapter" was a helpful feature in the book.The last part of the book is the author's plausible interpretation of the Great controversy's end.Along with a mountain of Scripture quotes, Mrs. White offered some memorable advice."Those who will not read the lessons from the book of God, are bidden to read it in the history of nations"- page 310."...how dare men teach that the Revelation is a mystery, beyond the reach of human understanding? It is a mystery revealed, a book opened."- page 364."It is not enough to have good intentions; it is not enough to do what a man thinks is right, or what the minister tells him is right. His soul's salvation is at stake, and he should search the Scriptures for himself."- page 635.I found the book to be beautifully written, based on Scripture, and sensible.Read the book for yourself, take the author's advice and compare it with Scripture and decide for yourself.

I bought the older version after reading a positive review about its commentary.This Torah commentary has not been a disappointment.The various comments and gleanings are fascinating!Gunther Plaut provided a variety of views on several verses and subjects in Torah.Whether the reader accepts or denies the views, its all worth reading and consideration.I like the organization of the book.Each section has an Introduction followed by the Hebrew text with the English beneath it.On the bottom of the pages is the Commentary with the associated verse half-bracketed. (This makes for easy navigation.)Some subjects merited their own heading and they precede the Gleanings. The Gleanings are at the end of each section.What I appreciate most is the volume of material in this commentary.The fact that this version is over 30 years old does not hinder it in my opinion.I use it and recommend it as a Torah study tool for anyone.

I bought the paperback version of the WEB after reading it on the internet.At this time the Old Testament isn't available in printed form yet.This Bible is a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901.One difference is the use of the scared name.The WEB uses Yahweh as compared to Jehovah.There was no "j" sound or letter in Hebrew.The WEB is my translation of choice for internet Bible research.It is accurate and easy to read.The footnotes are very helpful for clarifying words and telling of differences in greek text used.The Psalms are seperated and clearly marked.The other books are not seperated as individual chapters.Verses are identified with chapters in the text itself.So I use the the passage start and stop markers at the top of the pages for locating a particular passage.That's only a minor thing to me.The entire WEB is available free online at a number of sites.I will probably buy the complete WEB when it is printed.I like this translation!It's one of the better modern translations for accuracy and readability.

I saw an ad for this book stating that it was an answer to the Two House "theory."Had I seen that before ordering, I wouldn't have wasted my money on this book!!However,I made the most of it and read the book.Mr. Lancaster is a talented writer and some of the chapters are excellent.Chapter 9 deals with Acts 15 and he makes an excellent point about gentiles and Torah.Chapter 8 "Voices in the Thunder" was another very interesting chapter.Mr. Lancaster's identification of the Lost Sheep of Israel as "all Jews" is errant.OT prophecies of the unification of both houses/kingdoms has not been fulfilled.Rev.7:4-8,21:12 mention the twelve tribes regarding the 144,000 witnesses and the names on the gates of New Jerusalem. The Lost(tribes) Sheep of Israel are important in un-fufilled prophecy.They play a role alongside their Jewish brothers.One of the finer points that this book makes is the validity of Torah for everyone. It's not "legalism" or a "jewish thing".Anyone can benefit from Torah's blessings!!!

The print in this book is large as advertised.This hard cover has a good,sturdy binding.It's a smooth flowing read.Sheeran's words are in quotations while Brandt's words are in bold type.The Prologue in this book lays the groundwork for how Frank Sheeran eventually came to confess his involvement in the Hoffa disappearance.He explains why there would be no body to recover and how trusted people close to Jimmy Hoffa had to be involved.The information in this book verifies information in other mafia related books that I have read.Some examples:Hoffa's claim to possess audio sex tapes involving Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.Joe Kennedy recruiting Sam Giancana to steal the 1960 Presidential election.Multiple mafia figures and their involvment in the assassination of John F Kennedy.A lot of the organised crime figures in this book are mentioned in most JFK assassination books.It's interesting that Frank Sheeran claimed that he deilvered three rifles to David Ferrie in Baltimore shortly before the assassination.Jimmy Hoffa strenuously opposed the mafia's aiding Kennedy in the election.He was right in the end.The Nixon administration's corruption was detailed.One of the bigger contributing factors in Jimmy Hoffa's murder was the access to Teamster funds.Hoffa apparently was not as lenient as Frank Fitzsimmons in collecting debts.This book is believable to me.Each individual reader will have to assess for themselves whether this book is credible.It's one of the best mafia related books that I have read so far.

This book from Nat Hentoff covers the same ground that a lot of other authors have covered. He blasts Ashcroft and Bush for the Patriot Act, the rush to pass it, and the related erosion of civil liberties.What Mr. Hentoff does better than most writers is tie together the little-known activities used by Ashcroft and others to back-door unconstitutional provisions that were originally rejected.He also does an excellent job of exposing some of the positive counter-actions to the Patriot Act across the country. These actions by cities and towns across America got little media attention. The resistance is the best part of the book in my humble opinion.He provides first-hand observations from both Democrats and Republicans on the subject of former AG Ashcroft's lack of concern or lack of knowledge about the Constitution and Bill of Rights. An interesting quote from Ashcroft in a 1997 statement titled "Keep Big Brother's Hands Off the Internet" highlights the hypocrisy of the former AG. It's ironic that within a 5 year span Mr. Ashcroft went from that position to actually becoming an aggressive component of "Big Brother".Mr. Hentoff gives due credit to Senator Russ Feingold for opposing the Patriot Act.An interesting note was the changing of the name of the Carnivore Surveillance System.From the author- "This will be one of the severest tests yet to rescue the Constitution from our government.""The War on the Bill of Rights-and the Gathering Resistance" is repetitive and somewhat disjointed, but I recommend the book as one of the better books on the subject and arguably the best coverage on the resistance to the Patriot Act.

"When Corporations Rule the World" is thoroughly documented and very accurate.David Korten describes the many tentacles of global corporations. He examines the details surrounding the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad as the beginning of corporations receiving the same rights as individual citizens.He covers the rise of corporate power in the 1880's and 1890's. President Rutherford B. Hayes observed- "This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no more. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations."The author assesses the "free" market and "free" trade as instruments that allow global corporations to plan and organize world economic affairs to enrich themselves without any consequences regarding the environment or workers.Mr. Korten explains why capitalism favors the limited liability corporation. It provides unlimited, concentrated power with very limited accountability or legal liability.He favors corporate charters because there is accountability. Charters are a priviledge rather than a right.Mr. Korten examines the flawed projections that served as propaganda for NAFTA's passage. He emphasizes that while government shares some of the blame, the "giant corporations that owe no allegiance to place, people, or human interest" are the benficiaries.From page 133- "The game of global competition is rigged. It pits companies against people in a contest that the people almost always lose."Another accurate view on page 207 states- "The argument that globalization increases competition is simply false. To the contrary, it strengthens tendencies toward global-scale monopoly."The author explains why GATT and the WTO are bad for the general public, great for global corporations. I disagree with his idea of keeping either the U.N. family of organizations or the Bretton Woods group. Why not get rid of them all?His take on the China trade agreement was on point. The day after Bill Clinton signed the China trade agreement the Wall Street Journal "noted the real reason the corporate establishment put it's full lobbying weight behind the China Trade Bill: to guarantee that U.S. companies could safely move more production to China with assured access to U.S. markets." Does anyone else remember the Chinese campaign contributions to Clinton?The author has some intriguing solutions in the book. His idea of eliminating income tax on the lower income levels is one positive step. However I don't agree with some of his ideas. Guaranteed income is one of them."When Corporations Rule the World" is a sobering assessment of corporate greed that respects no borders. While it is somewhat dated, I recommend it.

As a Gary Moore fan I was mildly disappointed with this cd.Moore's best disc by far wasBad for You Baby.This disc has some great blues tracks and some that just aren't my cup of tea.What I really like is "Stormy Monday" (penned by T-Bone Walker). Gary Moore did that Albert King song justice with his version."The Prophet" is another funeral dirge type instrumental. Very emotionally charged!"Looking Back" is a catchy little tune with whimsical lyrics.As with other albums there is another standout cover tune to go along with "Stormy Monday"."You Upset Me Baby" is that song. It's a B.B.King song and serves as an example that Gary Moore was proficient at covering songs from artists with different styles.I preferAfter Hours,Close As You Get, and the previously mentioned "Bad For You Baby" over this cd.

This book analyzes Woodrow Wilson's personality and his relationships with others throughout his adult life. A lot of the material centers on his quests for power, first as an educator and then in politics.Colonel Edward House was one of three people to really become a confidant of Wilson.The sources for the book from Wilson are personal letters he wrote as well as speeches he gave. The personal papers of Edward Mandell House were also used as a source.From reading this book it is evident that Woodrow Wilson had severe personality flaws. His mental health problems in the 1890's were troubling! He was also obsessive in his pursuit of the presidency at the expense of anyone he could utilize to achieve that goal.What I took from the book was that Wilson was a megalomaniac and Edward House was a shrewd political manipulator(until the end of their friendship) that eventually was perceived by Wilson as a threat.On the presidential term, the book focuses on the defeat of the League of Nations which was aided mostly by Wilson's refusal to compromise. The authors also detail the circumstances of the falling out between Wilson and House.This is an excellent book about the psychology of Woodrow Wilson. Not as much attention is spent on House or some of the major changes in the U.S during Wilson's administration, namely the Federal Reserve Act, and Income tax.Overall WOODROW WILSON AND COLONEL HOUSE provides some insight on Woodrow Wilson from childhood to death. This book also addresses some of the politics and politicians of the WWI era.

"The Digest of Divine Law" was written by an attorney 60+ years ago.It remains a relevant book even today.From the Intro:"Unfortunately,when referring to the Law,the average theologian intuitively and because of his previous training,thinks only of ordinances when he ought to think in terms of all the law and eliminate the ordinances only-for Jesus eliminated them for us."While we are no longer under bondage to the Law,that doesn't mean that we can violate that Law.The gift of grace is used to further the false doctrine that the entire Law has been done away with.That is clearly not Scriptural!Mr.Rand shows the differences between Biblical Law for the individual and the Law for the nation(Biblical Israel).An interesting point is the idea that "In the beginning God began to reveal His Laws unto men."The author also uses Scripture to explain Peter's vision(it has nothing to do with diet)and that Messiah confirmed the Law!The average Christian knows the 10 Commandments, but what about the rest of the Law? The author shows the relevance of the Law in various aspects of life.Israel recieved the Law at Mt. Sinai and the church at Jersualem recieved the power to keep the Law at the time of Pentecost.Mr. Rand's portion on the Lord's Prayer was good. Particularly the part about temptation and translational differences with that part of the prayer.There are some Indexes in the back of the book that are both convenient and helpful.The only item in this book that I would dispute is where he says that Assyria is Germany.That does not line up geographically or historically.But,that is a minor issue in a book that is both organised and written well.This book reminds me of "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine. I highly recommend "Digest of Divine Law".

Waylon Jennings' autobiography stretches from his birth to 1996.Mr. Jennings shares his childhood memories of a large family living in humble, small houses. Like a lot of country music stars of that era, he came from a poor family.He wrote about some of his heroes of country music- Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubbs.Most everyone that knows who Waylon Jennings was is familiar with his connection to Buddy Holly. Waylon doesn't disappoint the readers that are curious to read about life on the road with Buddy Holly. If not for Buddy Holly and his confidence in a young Waylon Jennings, he may not have the singing career later.Another area of interest was Waylon's career as a disc jockey.He doesn't gloss over the wide-spread use of pills in Nashville and his personal use of drugs during his career.This book also details some of Waylon Jennings' experiences with the record labels and other management types in Nashville and on the road. He got ripped off like a lot of other music artists.It was interesting to read Waylon's take on the difference between playing in a studio vs. playing live in a honky-tonk and his preference for playing live.He shared his view of the "Nashville Sound" and the CMA.On the Nashville Sound he wrote this on page 176-"Nashville was just too insular, too caught up in itself."The reader gets a first-hand glimpse at why Mr. Jennings became a part of "Outlaw Country".Some of his shared experiences with his contemporaries were very humorous.Overall, this is a good autobiography of a true country rebel who played a part in changing country music and the monumental role his wife Jessi played in his overcoming years of drug addiction.

THE INSIDERS by John F. McManus is a survey of "insider" domination in the last five administrations - from Carter to G.W.Bush's first term.Mr. McManus traces the CFR back to it's roots and the man who founded the organization.These "Insiders" have pushed their agenda for a "New World Order" on behalf of those with power and above all money. I call them "internationalists". On page 20 the author illustrates a point that rings especially true today. "Rather than improve the standard of living for other nations, world government will mean a forced redistribution of all wealth and a sharp reduction in the standard of living for Americans." What do we have today in America with rising unemployment?Another interesting view was quoted from a Wall Street Journal article printed on April 10,1990. "The State Department and White House might conduct diplomacy in peace and command armies in war, but policy was made by serious people, men with a longer view,i.e. the great men of Finance and the advisers. New York was where they were to be found."- Paul H. Nitze, CFR member. Found on page 70.Mr. McManus addressed the Clinton impeachment and why some high ranking Republicans kept the scope of the investigation limited.The author points out the disturbing habit of most presidents of seeking sanction for war from the UN rather than Congress.The best material in the book from my point of view was on pages 132-136 under the heading "Following the European Union Model". The program that he refers to is a larger merger of the Americas. It resembles the North American Union only on a larger scale. The CFR has published papers on a "North American Community" one titled "Creating a North American Community: Chairmen's Statement from an Independent Task Force on the Future of North America." That article is easily found with a search of the CFR website. The article is a must read for anyone seriously interested in the subject.Mr. McManus provides source notes at the end of each chapter as well as alphabetical membership lists for the CFR and Trilateral Commission at the back of the book.This is a very good book when it comes to explaining why both parties have an identical relationship to certain organizations. Only the names and faces change for each party.

Kevin Phillips provides lessons in history on the decline of the Dutch and British that parallel the decline in Washington D.C. that was evident in the 1990s.He also explains the Jeffersonian idea that Washington must be periodically "attacked and purged" in a political, electoral sense- a "populist" process of American electoral "realignment and renewal."He provides some stunning numbers while documenting the explosive growth in the staffing of congressional and senatorial aides. Not only that, but there has been expansive growth of lobbyists, think tanks, and the crossover of former government officials.On the culture of Washington D.C. Mr Phillips had this to say- "The important thing is that both parties are enmeshed; neither is any longer able to fulfill campaign promises about cleaning house in Washington."And he's right!On finance and government he observed that speculation replaced investment and financiers gained more control of government. The philosophy that short term speculation is pursued rather than long term investing.He also critically assesses derivatives and the related speculating.A few great quotes on finance and government were in the book.From Business Week in 1992- "The trouble is, Corporate America is surviving at the expense of Household America."From Thomas Jefferson- "Banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies."While I don't agree with some of the 10 solutions that form Mr. Phillips plan for bettering government, I find some of them be sensible!The best in my opinion was confronting the power of multinational corporations and minimizing the effects of globalization on average Americans. The regulating of speculative finance and reducing Wall Street's influence on government would be another idea that I like.Another title that I considered for this review was "A Lost Oppurtunity".I think that Kevin Phillips was correct on a lot of his criticisms in the book and the last 15 years have born that out, especially on the economy and finances.

This book addresses the controversial issues of social justice and the Christian view of it.Mr. Wallis refers to Scripture often to make the point that we as a people should be concerned with the poor and less fortunate members of our country.This book more than anything else, offers a Christian viewpoint altogether different than the conservative political positions of organizations like the Moral Majority or Christian Coalition.The author correctly criticizes the "prosperity message" prevalent in many churches.My favorite Chapter in the book is Chapter 4 "Dangerous Religion".Mr. Wallis cautions against the dangers of co-opting religion with an "American empire" or a pre-emptive, "God is on our side" approach to foreign policy.On page 59 the author makes an interesting point about religion and politics,"The separation of church and state does not require banishing moral and religious values from the public square."He observes that the growing gap in America between the wealthy and everyone else is both a moral and a "religious" issue.The author does repeat himself occasionally but not to the point of annoying this reader.The minor complaint that I do have with this edition is the type or font size. It's too small!Overall a book worth reading if you are interested in an alternative to "conservative" religious books on politics.Mr. Wallis addresses many thought-provoking issues of today's political environment.

I bought this cd for the car. As a Merle Haggard fan I figured I'd have some of the best Merle Haggard tunes for the road.I generally avoid live recordings, they tend to be low sound quality with few exceptions.This particular disc is one of those exceptions.The sound quality is very good!The selection of songs is great also.Another plus with this cd is the information listed on the back slip.Each track has the country chart position and year, publisher, and writer. Some of the tracks also list the pop chart position.The only downside I see is the absence of Roy Nichols. He was not the lead guitar player on this disc. Nichols was one of the all-time greats for country guitar. In his place is a guitarist named Clint Strong. He played almost as well as Roy Nichols, but an avid Haggard fan will notice the difference.While this is not a complete collection of Merle Haggard's best songs, it's a very good start!If you want a more complete collection with more songs check out these two cds:Hag: The Best of Merle HaggardCapitol Collectors Series: Merle Haggard

Mr Palast's book is more a collection of articles. His writing style is somewhat sarcastic, but effective at getting his point across to the reader.Some of the subjects in this book are:The voter fraud in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. Mr Palast has done a lot of research on the issue and he has documentation. This whole scandal revolved around felons with voting rights restored by other states and the Florida Secretary of State not recognizing those restored rights and the related votes that were cast.The profiteering by pharmaceutical companies and the method sometimes used in securing patents for drugs.The exploitive side of illegal immigration-low wages for longer hours."Secret trade treaty documents reveal the shark hidden in the free trade swimming pool..."-page 67. That shark is revealed to be "the neccessity test" of Global Trade as decided by the World Trade Organization.Pat Robertson and his connection to George W. Bush's rebound in the 2000 election in the South Carolina and Virgina primaries. The author also examines some of the Reverend's financial dealings.Monsanto's influence in securing FDA approval of BST(bovine growth hormone)despite dubious results in lab tests conducted on rats.There is a strange parallel between the Clinton and second Bush administration's connections to energy companies like Enron and in the Clintons' case,Entergy International.The true "wisdom" of deregulated electricity is this...profits are privatized while losses are socialized.WalMart and the dubious connection to Chinese labor. Hillary Clinton's involvement with the corporation is addressed also.An interesting quote from Johnny Chung about the Clinton White House-"I see the White House is like a subway-you have to put in coins to open the gates."Greg Palast has written a very good,thoroughly-researched book about corruption in both Democrat and Republican administrations. I recommend this book and will be looking for more of his work.

This book was published in 1975. I am surprised by how much of the information in "The CIA-Mafia Link" has been confirmed by more recent books. Mr. Ashman did an admirable job in researching the subject!Before the Prologue is a quote from Harry Truman. It's a strong word of caution about the CIA.There are many colorful characters in the book, like Howard Hughes and some high officials in the CIA that I hadn't heard of.The author detailed assassinations of foreign leaders in Central America as well as other CIA activities:Domestic spying on American citizens.The CIA's journalistic endeavors-writers and secret publishers.The Center for International Studies at M.I.T.Global Marine Company as a CIA asset.Robert Maheu and how he fit in to the CIA activities.The Kennedy-Sinatra-Giancana relationship is covered well.Ashman poses the question of just how much Kissinger knew about the domestic activities of the Agency.An intersting tidbit about the Giancana murder was the choice of weapon used, a .22. You would normally expect a larger calibre gun for a mafia hit.One aspect of the book that I think is incorrect is the view of Oswald as a Castro sympathesizer. That was more likely a cover.This is a good book for anyone wanting to investigate the mutually beneficial relationship between the CIA and organized crime.

"Scream at the Sky" is a well-written true crime tale about Faryion Wardrip and the murders of five young women in the Wichita Falls area of north Texas.The story of how Carlton Stowers came to write this book is interesting in it's own right.This is another baffling case of Texas justice where a man kills a victim and gets released after serving a small fraction of his sentence! I'm sure that Wardrip felt secure in his belief that he got away with the other murders that he committed. And he did for more than a decade.Until determined D.A. Barry Macha joined up with a new Investigator named John Little, the cases were unsolved and the connection to Wardrip was unknown.Carlton Stowers does an excellent job of detailing the brilliant investigative work involved and the sorrows and pain endured by the survivors. DNA technology and Roy Hazelwood's profile were also aids in the investigation.Wardrip reverted back to his old deceitful, manipulative ways after getting the death sentence. He killed out of anger and he comes across as the unbalanced kid that hurts others when he doesn't get what he wants. His brother sets the record straight at the end of the book."Scream at the Sky" is a top-shelf true crime book that leads the reader through the twists and turns of the cases from start to finish.

Charles Lewis and the Center for Public Integrity provide a lot of campaign finance information and numbers in this book. Call it following the money trail. They do that very well!One of the more disturbing observations in the book is that the race for the White House is basically narrowed down to the two major party contestants the year before the election by way of the money amounts collected. The wealthiest interests often have a heavy influence on that selection.There is plenty of financial information on who backed George Bush for president as well as a brief, intriguing college and business bio of Mr. Bush.This book has some of the most detailed numbers and information on the Florida fiasco of election 2000. It's on par with the work done by Greg Palast. The "false positives" as collateral damage in the felon voter purge was driven home with an example of an African-American preacher falsely purged and how he had to argue for his right to vote. Equally disgusting was the story of the lobbyist/former Florida state official who profited from her own incompetence by making a commission(profit) on both sides of a transaction when she sold some Florida counties new voting machines.The author even turned up some connections between active lobbyists and the infamous BCCI bank. The lobbyist connection with the national party committees is another topic covered in the book.Of the books on the subject of Bush and Enron, this book shares some of the details of letters sent between Ken Lay and George W. Bush demonstrating the long, friendly relationship between the two.Dozens of cabinet and other key posts were filled by people working for the industries that they would be responsible for regulating. This administration has been arrogant about conflict-of-interest violations. As well as secretive and when it comes to releasing proposals, oppurtunistic. Take the release of controversial proposals on Fridays or on holidays to avoid public visibility as much as possible.There is a wealth of political and financial information on the president, but this book is anything but partisan. The last section of the book investigates the Democrat candidates of 2004 and their finances as well.This book answers the question of who bankrolls the candidates and what they expect in return in a clear manner.Highly recommended reading for an understanding of how presidential campaign financing works. It would have been interesting to have a 2008 version available.

This book addresses the wise use of national power.Senator Fullbright cautions against over-extension that has led to the decline of past empires.The author defines Arrogance of Power as "a psychological need that nations seem to have in order to prove that they are bigger, better, or stronger than other nations" and "the tendency of great nations to equate power with virtue and major responsibilities with a universal mission."The Senator also was critical of wars justified by "vital national interest".Senator Fulbright points out that domestic policy suffers when war becomes the focal point of American policy.His warning about the side effects of pre-emptive war has proven accurate in current times.One has to wonder how different things in America would have been had Senator Fulbright's ideas been pursued during the Viet Nam era.This book is very much dated, but the Senator's views are timeless and he communicates those ideas very well. This is still an excellent book on foreign policy and it's definitely not a "dry read".

Fox's "Book of Martyrs" is a must read for anyone wanting to read about the dark side of Christian history.This book gives the gory details of persecution and murder in different countries,by various authorities.The book details the deaths of the Disciples in the first part of the book.The martyrdoms detailed in this book go back to various Roman Emperors and following that of the Popes.The Inquisition is included.Persecutions of the Quakers and the Albigenses are listed also.Read how "Bloody Mary" earned her nickname.This book shows that religious differences of beliefs were not always tolerated or forgiven!

As the previous reviewer suggested, this is a good starter collection of Wilson Pickett's music.The popular classics are on this cd-"Funky Broadway","Mustang Sally", "Land Of 1000 Dances", and the title track.It's not a complete collection by any means with only 10 songs.But what's on it makes it worth buying, particularly if you find it at a cheap price!The mix of horns,organ,and bass is just right and Wilson Pickett had a voice like nobody else.I generally don't care for cover songs as I feel that they don't fare well in comparison to the original.Wilson Pickett's version of "Sugar Sugar" is an exception to the rule!The sound quality on this disc is very good and it isn't one of those cheap reproductions.It's Wilson Pickett's recordings of his original songs.If you want a starter cd for your collection, this could be it. It probably wouldn't be enough to satisfy a big Pickett fan though....

I bought THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF JEWISH MYTH, MAGIC,AND MYSTICISM as a reference tool.It's in alphabetical order so it's very easy to locate any word I want to look up.I find some of the definitions to be intriguing and relevant for a wide audience of potential readers.Some of the most influential Rabbis are included in the listings.Here are some of the definitions that Rabbi Dennis covers in this encyclopedia-Magen David-Gad-Ephod-Targum-Names of God-Magic-Nazarites.There is a Bibliography and a Quick Reference Glossary of Frequently Used Terms. The glossary defines words like "Midrash", "Gloss",and "Aggadah".This book can be a useful resource even for those of us that don't practice kabbala.

I discovered Garet Garrett while reading "Reclaiming the American Right" by Justin Raimondo. There were some quotes from Garrett's work in that book that I found interesting considering the time that he wrote his books. Mr. Garrett was one of the more vocal opponents of FDR and the "New Deal". In addition to that distinction, he was also one of the "Old Right", or put another way, part of the original, genuine conservative movement before that movement changed significantly into what it is today.This edition was printed in 1953. What's amazing is how little some political ideology has changed since then. Take this quote; "And the mere thought of 'America First', associated as that term is with 'isolationism', has become a liability so extreme that politicians feel obliged to deny ever having entertained it." Think back to Ron Paul's 2008 campaign and how he was labeled an "isolationist" for similar views of nationalism.The first part of the book- "The Revolution Was", dated 1944, is a critique of the New Deal. Whether or not the reader agrees with Mr Garrett's views, he explains economics and related policies in an easy to understand(or laymen's)terms. Some more of the issues he addresses are; executive power, the gold standard, and farm subsidies.The next section of "The People's Pottage" is titled "Ex America" from 1951.This segment includes a timeless quote on U.S. foreign policy. "You are imperialistic all the same, whether you realize it or not... You are trying to make the kind of world you want. You are trying to impose the American way of life on other people, whether they want it or not."The author observed this type of foreign policy over 50 years ago and it's still part of U.S. foreign policy even today. We have the benefit of seeing some of the consequences from not heeding Mr. Garrett's warning.Another interesting issue was the progressive federal income tax and the author's linking of it as a "cardinal point" in "the Communist Manifesto".From the diary of FDR's Secretary of Treasury Morgenthau he described the whimsical method of setting the price of gold.The last part of the book is from 1952 and titled "Rise of Empire".It opens with the sentence "We have crossed the boundary between Republic and Empire."There is a critical view of President Truman's usurpation of Congress' power to declare war. Truman's claim that that particular clause in the Constitution was "obsolete" was arrogant at the least.Some of the "distinguishing marks" of an empire taken from history were enlightening. Such marks are easily observed today. "Domestic policy becomes subordinate to foreign policy" and " A system of satellite nations" are two most readers would be familiar with.His labeling of this policy as the "Empire of the Bottomless Purse" was historically accurate.This book has an excellent,understandable explanation of inflation and also the gold standard."The People's Pottage" has proven to be ahead of it's time and as relevant today as the time when it was written. I recommend this edition for it's availability and it is currently affordable.

In the author's words, this book serves as a "guided tour of conservative America's financial values and strategies."The book lives up to it's promise!I can identify with Charles Kelly's reasons for advocating being a populist. As a former conservative Republican, I can't argue with his points. Especially when he repeatedly quotes conservative media sources for his evidence.Mr. Kelly describes the meaning behind buzz words like "wage inflation" and "wage price spiral". When someone uses those words they are looking to keep wages down so the investors and other folks at the top can enlarge their riches. The first priority for the financial elites is corporate profits and their own personal incomes. That is the main cause of outsourcing, wage stagnation, and the decimation of the middle class.On who the government protects, Mr. Kelly was prescient when he wrote that it is wealthy investors and their bank accounts.The recent Wall Street bailout confirmed his point!"The new world order was designed for investors, at the expense of of all who work." - page 80.He casts blame on both parties and advocates seriously considering liberal Democrats and independent Populist candidates over Republicans and conservative Democrats.He poses the question of just how long "unmanaged trade" would last if CEOs, economists, and bankers jobs were susceptible to outsourcing? Like he writes- it "would die in a heartbeat".There is a wealth of quotable material in this book and Mr. Kelly writes in a style that would be humorous if the subject wasn't so sobering.Mr. Kelly documents his sources throughout the book and also offers some ideas for solutions.I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand conservative politics and its real view of the middle class.An aspect of this book that struck me while I read it is this- the book was copyrighted in 2000 and it is still so relevant for today. We are still on the same course, only further down the path.This one is a keeper, and my personal favorite on the subject.Two other books I recommend are:The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It BackScrewed: The Undeclared War Against the Middle Class - And What We Can Do about It (BK Currents (Paperback))

The Goodmans have produced an exceptional expose' on the Bush administration's style of "freedom". It's the freedom to know what they want us to know. The press has been leashed/limited in their coverage of the war in Iraq. This was accomplished by the introduction of "embed" reporters during the height of the invasion.This book highlights foreign aid double-standards where human rights are concerned. Amy Goodman and Allan Nairns were eye witnesses to mass executions perpetrated by an ally,Indonesia.Some points brought up in this book are:Donald Rumsfeld's denial of being a presidential envoy to Saddam Hussein in the early 80's after Hussein used poison gas on opponents. The use of that gas went from being a non-factor to a motive for invading Iraq a few decades later.The Zumach documments-the unredacted Iraq report to the U.N. that detailed it's weapon program only confirms what has long been believed by many.....U.S. corporate and official complicity in arming Iraq.The blueprint for post-9/11 foreign policy was drawn up by the Project for the New American Century founded in 1997 to promote American imperialism. Membership is represented by many of the warhawks-Rumsfeld,Cheney,Scooter Libby,Wolfowitz,and Richard Perle."In an administration that has taken a pledge of allegiance to enrich it's billionaire buddies,one crony captitalist trumps them all:Vice President Dick Cheney."-page 65."For the Bush family,taking care of business-and it's billionaire friends-has always come first,and these friends have always repaid the favor by taking very good care of the Bushes."-page 45. Cronyism at it's worst.The Carlyle Group appears in that context.The domestic propaganda machine was examined and how it was used to support the war before,during, and since the invasion of Iraq.The "Oilygarchy" chapter was a well-presented expose' on the corporations that are profiteering from the current wars and the "crony connections" that make it possible.The Goodmans book is one of the better critiques on the subject of current foreign policy. The equal of "Sorrows of Empire" by Chalmers Johnson in my opinion. Amy Goodman does write from first-hand experience and as an investigative journalist she has a unique perspective. "The Exceptions to the Rulers" is highly recommended reading!

This classic written in 1956 is somewhat dated, but it rings true today on the basic aspects of power elites.It also demonstrates the connection between wealth and power.Mr. Mills points out that wealth is usually attain by inheritance. He examines the crossover between the three domains.He offers a simple explanation of three domains of power-the military("warlords"), the CEOs("corporation chieftains"), and the "political directorate".What the elite pursue and hold hasn't changed over the centuries; money, power, and prestige.On page 271 Mr. Mills describes the third epoch of the American power elite as the "supremacy of corporate economic power" which began in 1866 with congressional elections and the Supreme Court decision which "declared that the Fourteenth Amendment protected the corporation."Even today you get glimpses of corporate power in American society.There are more recent books on the subject, but I notice that a lot of those books frequently quote from this book.It's a dry read in spots, but has educational value in understanding power and elitism.

In this book Herbert Armstrong did provide some valid points about Scriptural Israel in a physical sense. He effectively demonstrated the difference between Israel and Judah.The other interesting subject was the adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh by Jacob(Israel) and his conferring his name on them.There were a lot of vague or unproven theories in THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN IN PROPHECY.Among them was a "translation correction" (page 35) of Genesis 16:12 that supposedly states that Ishmael's descendants will "dwell to the East". Mr. Armstrong does not give a reference for that translation. None of the Scripture translations that I checked have anything like that wording. Which leads me to wonder if that is the author's personal "correction"?Another contradictory subject is found on page 56."After the coming of Christ to rule, it is evident that Israel is again to offer sacrifices, burnt offerings, and meat offerings. In Ezekiel's prophecy, from the 40th chapter to the end of the book, covering this period after Christ's coming, these sacrifices are mentioned."What he failed to understand was that in reading those last chapters in Ezekiel a reader will find in the 44th chapter, verse 27 that "sin offerings" are being made! "On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering." HCSB Ezekiel 44:27. He mistakes the High Priest from some other time for the Messiah's return. How else would the author square that passage with repentance available through the Messiah's sacrifice?He repeats another unsubstantiated theory from MYSTERY OF THE AGES. That is the idea that Simon the sorceror started "a counterfeit Christianity".He also wrote that Germany used to be Assyria. No foundation offered on that either.He repeats the popular theory that the "beast" in Revelation is "the coming resurrected Holy Roman Empire in Europe. That would be a 10 nation political-military union. Add to that the "mark of the beast" will be branded onto people.Read the book for yourself. But I would definitely refer to Scripture frequently!

Most of what I knew about Hillary Rodham Clinton was from the Clinton presidency. This book does fill in some blanks while missing numerous key incidents. I would have liked to have seen more material on Vince Foster and also campaign finance corruption. The author didn't cover the last days in the White House where a lot of dubious activity took place. He made a passing reference to "Pardongate" without detailing the players.There were some informational topics in the book.Her childhood was an interesting subject and explains her aggressive,sometimes physical behavior.The most troubling revelation from this book is Hillary's choice of reading material after High School. The magazine "motive" was a marxist magazine that helps to explain some of her socialist ideas. According to this book she proudly claimed in 1994 that she kept every issue."Heading up health care reform was the only major administrative job she tried to do. And she was a complete flop at it.She had neither the grasp of policy substance,the managerial skills nor the political smarts to do the job she was then given..."-Bradford DeLong.That was interesting insight from someone in the White House that explains why she failed so miserably on the health care plan.I found the story of George Stephanopolis' and James Carville's losing their composure over Bill Clinton's suggestion that Hillary's negative image was due to her hair style to be hilarious.This book is a fast read. I am sure that with the sheer volume of public information and scandalous corruption of the Clintons,that there are more informative,and comprehensive books available.

I found this book to be a readable, text-book type of read.It's a good,comprehensive history of the use of snipers in various wars thoughout history.It has a history of weapons- from the musket to the modern rifle.Mr. Gilbert covers the changes and what precipitated those changes in warfare.He also details the evolution of sniping from the Civil War, Boer War, World Wars I & II, Korea, and Viet Nam. Approaches and use of sniping in various countries are examined.The material on ammunition and the medical science of wounds are interesting to a common reader curious about the various aspects of sniping.As expected, the author included some brief experiences from notables like Carlos Hathcock and Chuck Mawhinney.Mr. Gilbert sums up the ways that sniping has changed on page 191."Modern sniper training is essentially a consolidation of lessons learned in the past, from the trenches of the First World War to the jungles of Viet Nam."Rather than an instruction manual, I view this book as more of a history book. And a good one at that.

This is the first exposure I have had to Mr. Beinhart's writing. He is an excellent author in that he took a fairly well-known subject, (propaganda) and made it an exciting topic.He casts a critical eye at the M.O. of the Bush administration.Bushenomics is one of the topics. Bushenomics= taking tax dollars and giving it to the rich. Remind anyone else of the Bush plan to bail out Wall Street last week?He examines the work of White House attorneys like John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez who accomplished the feat of creating two classes of people: those beneath the law and those above the law. Of course George W. Bush is in the last category.Larry Beinhart delved into Bush's business history as well as Cheney's less than stellar record at Halliburton.I found Cheney's draft deferment record more than a little interesting!There are two quotes that I thought really stood out in "Fog Facts":On Page 30 "What if someday, somebody who was not a neoconservative Republican loyalist stumbled into a position of authority at the Justice Department and begin to prosecute people under section 18 of the United States Code 2441, the War Crimes Act?"An intriguing idea that I'm sure would receive wide support!The other is the "Random Stupididity Theory""The most brilliant person in the world will make a stupid decision occasionally. If that person is in charge of the entire economy, then the whole economy goes in a stupid direction. If that person has stupid subordinates, and they follow his directions stupidly, then the economy will go wrong too."I found "Fog Facts" to be a quick and entertaining read.

The Foreword to the book is a transcript from an interview that the author did with Rush Limbaugh in 2002."Guns,Freedom,and Terrorism" addresses many issues relating to gun rights.Some are:*Arming airline pilots-The history of that issue and thoughts of airline pilots.*What the "Kabul Document" really says.It has no mention of American guns shows!*The Clinton Administrations blatant misuse of HUD and government funds to extort gun manufacturers through frivolous lawsuits.*The medis bias against the NRA and the media's distortion of facts on a regular basis.*The rejection by higher courts of the "collective rights" myth in favor of the Constitutionally guaranteed individual rights.Witness the recent Appeals Court decision finding the DC gun ban unconstitutional.What I didn't expect to read in the book was John McCain's advocacy for the gun show law. As Wayne LaPierre points out, terrorists don't buy weapons at gun shows. That's fear-mongering.He uses the Martin Bryant case in Australia as an example of how badly governemnts fail to protect citizens.The government failed to heed numerous warnings about Bryant.To cover their negligence they blame guns for the mass murders."Guns,Freedom,and Terrorism" is an answer to the gun control lobby and blatantly biased media.

This book has a Contents section in the front and an Index in the back making it very useful as a guide to food cures found in the Bible.There are cautionary words and testimonials throughout the book.I find the book is also educational in a Biblical sense.There is information on plants,herbs,oils etc..that are mentioned in Scripture.This book has proven beneficial to me personally with the discovery of Essiac Tea and information on Saw Palmetto.If you are looking for a guide book of natural remedies this would be a great choice!It's comprehensive and easily navigated.

The purpose of this book to dispel the myth that George W. Bush is a conservative.Bruce Bartlett starts out by explaining that many conservative had reservations about this Bush after being disappointed by his father's presidency.He comments on the war in Iraq on page 10. "Most traditional conservatives had deep misgivings about the war, which was driven mainly by neoconservatives, a conservative offshoot established by former liberals."Allen Lichtman is quoted on Bush's presidency. "Political revolution in the United States, creating a form of conservative big government that promotes not the general interests of ordinary Americans, but the special intersts of big corporations."George H. W Bush lost his bid for reelection partly because of the economy. That highlighted his disinterest in economic policy. He focused on foreign policy and neglected domestic policy.John Dilulio revealed that there has been a lack of "serious policy fiber" regarding economics in G.W's administration. The economic advisers in the current administration have no clear direcion and very little input in decisions.The economic crises that we have today are caused in large part by George W. Bush's ignorance and lack of interest on economic policy or the process of studying options.There are insider quotes from Richard Clarke and Ron Suskind about the attitude in the Bush White House that come off as arrogant and detached from reality.I think that Mr. Bartlett has accurately diagnosed the myriad of leadership flaws in the current president and I agree that he is not a conservative by any means, particularly on the economy.There were some interesting tidbits such as-*That Paul Krugman was an adviser to Enron.*Columnist Jim Pinkerton noted that Karl Rove got his start in politics during Nixon's 1972 campaign.*The author finds multiple similarites between Bush 2 and Nixon on domestic policy and pandering for votes. Bush is definitely a big government-big spender!Some points that I don't agree with at all are that trade protection is a bad thing for one.Protectionism is a great idea if you work in a factory or a textile mill where jobs were or could be outsourced!Another is that I don't agree that the E.P.A. and O.S.H.A. are less important that the cost to business associated with their regulations.Bruce Bartlett does make a compelling case for George W. Bush being an impostor. Bartlett takes a look from a historical standpoint at Bush's economic disaster compared to policies of former presidents. The economic information is rigorous reading but the book overall is worth a read.

I bought the Quik Tune guitar tuner for two reasons.First, I had an older Quik Tune tuner for a bass guitar (the type that had a needle) and it worked well as basic unit.Second, the price was cheap.This version is better and more versatile than my older model.I like the size of the Guitar Professor. For me it's handy, but has a large enough display so that I can see it clearly.It works pretty good without plugging the tuner into the electric guitar.It's very easy to use for E-A-D-G-B-e tuning.The Chord Finder is an added bonus, especially for a beginner if you don't want to use bulky chord diagrams.I would definitely buy this model again.

This is a good,early work with some helpful genealogical lists at the end of it.Mr.Allen does an excellent job of explaining the joining the Zarah and Pharez lines of Judah with the marriage of Tea Tephi to Herremon(son of Gallum aka William the Conqueror).One issue from a prior review should be investigated with Scripture.If Israel was never lost or they were destroyed,why would the Messiah send his disciples to "the lost sheep of Israel"(Mt.10:6)and why would James be addressed to the "12 tribes in the dispersion"(James 1:1)?Old Testament prophecy has not been fulfilled!Read Rev. 4:6-8 and you will find listed there the 4 brigade standards of Israel.Some of the things that I found interesting in this book:There is an excelllent linking of Ireland(names and places)with Hebrew names.Herremon's family history has multiple men named Heber.The name "Milesian" as in "Milesian Kings" means soldier in Latin.I have read and heard of Ollam Fallah being the prophet Jeremiah.I would have liked to see some form of evidence backing up the suggestion that Jeremiah and Baruch the scribe were related to the princesses of Judah.Particularly Jeremiah as Grandfather of Tea Tephi.While there are many good elements to this book,I can't agree with the "spiritual Israel" concept.Call it "replacement theology"or "dispensationalism", it isn't supported by the Bible.Israel is not spiritual.It's a physical entity.None of the tribes have been permanently excluded or replaced from recieving the Messiah.While Gentiles can be grafted into the Commonwealth of Israel,the idea that the church replaces Judah or Israel is not true.This is a good book and worth reading,but there are three books that I recommend more on the subject."Israel's Tribes Today" by Steven M. Collins."The Story of Celto-Saxon Israel" by W.H.Bennett."Symbols of our Celto-Saxon Heritage" by W.H.Bennett.These books are the best I have read on the subject of the lost tribes of Israel to date.

This book is comprehensive and well-written. It's one of the best books on the subject of the lost tribes of Israel.There is information on the camp arrangements of the tribes and the brigade emblems. These emblems are identical with the "four living creatures" found in the Bible.See Ezekiel 1:10 and Revelation 4:7.Mr.Bennett covers or includes the following:The mention of Israelite captives on Assyrian monuments.The witness of the Apocrypha and Josephus regarding the lost tribes.The Scottish Declaration of Independence(translated into English).An appendix detailing the view of Jewish scholarship.What is interesting with this particular index is that Jewish scholars have held that the lost tribes of Israel have not re-united with Jewry.The Index of Scripture Passages and Index of Persons,Places,and Subjects are convenient as a reference.I recommend this book for anyone that would like to study this subject.

I recently bought this Bible after carefully comparing the text online at the publisher's website.The "Goals of this translation" stated in the HCSB Introduction are all honorable and I'd argue that they did acheive them.This is an accurate,readable Bible in contemporary English.The study helps are valuable and the accuracy was not compromised due to cultural or social agendas(gender inclusive trend).The footnotes in this Bible are educational.A good example is found in the difficult passage of 1 Sam.6:19 "God struck down the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the Lord.He struck Down 70 men[out of]50,000 men.."The footnote reads "Some Hb mss,Josephus read 70 men."Study of other Bible versions will show that there are many different interpretations of this verse.The HCSB has a sensible rendering of the passage.This is not a "study" Bible per se.But the additional helps were a surprise!Some features that I really like are:"Where to Turn" is a convenient,helpful section.The Table of Weights and Measures and the Bullet Notes come in handy also.The words of Christ in red.The bold typeface of the OT passages when quoted in the NT.The use of "Yahweh" in the OT when the text emphasizes The Name."Yahweh" is likely not the actual name(YaHUaH) but a step toward recognising the importance of The Name is a positive in this translation in my opinion.Uses "Messiah" in a Jewish context and "Christ" in a Christian context.The quality of this hardcover binding is excellent,especially considering the very reasonable price!This Bible is versatile enough that a new student or an older student of the Bible will both benefit from it's use.

THE MYSTERY OF THE AGES is an interesting book as far as investigating religious beliefs.Mr. Armstrong's work is very popular with some branches formerly aligned with the World Church of God. Anyone wanting to get an idea of the beliefs held by those churches will find a lot of that information in this book.Now for the book itself...I found more than a few of Mr. Armstrong's points to be speculative at best.The connection between Simon the sorcerer and a Babylon pagan religious system is a reach. The author wrote-"But Simon proclaimed himself a Christian apostle, nevertheless, and called the pagan Babylonian mystery religion 'Christianity.'" Acts chapter 8 says nothing to support Mr. Armstrong's theory despite the fact that Mr. Armstrong's claim that the passage would describe that the sorcerer was "the leader of the Babylonian mystery religion in Samaria."Mr. Armstrong is among the writers that advocate that "Mystery Babylon" is the Common Market/revived Roman Empire. Currently the European Union has 27 members, not 10.On page 55 he writes- "It will come as a surprise to many to learn that angels inhabited the earth before the creation of man."On Job 38:4,7 he says "This passage from Job implies it." After reading that passage, I can see that angels predated creation, but placing them on earth before man was created from that passage is a stretch at best.On page 114 he interprets the marriages in Genesis 6:2 as being inter-racial. That's an interesting theory, but where did it come from?On page 116 the author describes Nimrod as "a large,powerfully built black who developed into a great hunter."While he does cover a lot of Nimrod's influence on the people of his time, he offers no support for his theory on Nimrod's race. Just mere speculation.If you want to read about the beliefs advocated by Herbert Armstrong, this book provides that.I recommend reading the Scripture passages and deciding for yourself.

Michael Lerner hits many marks in this book that melds spirituality with politics.He makes the point that spirituality doesn't necessarily translate into organized religion. An individual can have moral character without being religious.The other side of the coin is the Religious Right with it's interest in wealth(prosperity message)and corporate power, Republican policies in short.His predictions about Democrats reactions to spiritual issues and values have proven correct lately.My favorite Chapter was the fourth, "Enter the Religious Right".As well as articulating precisely what is wrong with the Right, he does a critique of the Left and it's failures.The joining of "idealistic Christians" and the political Right created "an unholy merger of corporate power and Christian fervor."Many political positions of the right run counter to the teachings of Jesus.While Democrats and the Left in general have a tendency to sell the intelligence of those on the Right short. He makes the point that there are good people on both sides of American politics.Another interesting topic was Michael Lerner's opinion of the McGovern loss in 1972.In his view it wasn't a rejection of liberal ideas. Those ideas were discarded in the campaign well before election day.He relates similar experiences with the Clinton presidency.The Democrats unwillingness to advocate populist policies is the result of "losing their nerve".That has been evident with the current administration also. Populist rhetoric sounds great for speeches but not domestic policy. Sound bites don't translate into policy positions very often.On page 313 Mr. Lerner writes- "We live in a society in which the bottom line is money and power and the common sense is to look out for number one."He's absolutely correct about that!He offers by far the best plan for corporate charters that I have heard of!Simple, but very much a populist idea.For me, this has been the most impressive book on what's wrong with American politics morally. Both domestically and in foreign policy, the wrong approach has been fostered and it's time to take another approach.I highly recommend this book whether the reader is religious or not, this book is one that should be on every short list!

I bought two sets of SIT (Stay In Tune) electric guitar strings for a Douglas Shadow guitar.One plus for this brand is it is readily available at a cheap price.The second positive is that each set included an extra Hi E and B string.The strings have held up great as far as durability.As far as staying in tune, they are better than Markley Signature strings for staying in tune. That's the only comparison that I can make from experience so far.The heavier strings- E, A ,and D strings have a tinnier sound than I like.Overall, these strings are decent for a bargain string. Are they the best? I wouldn't go that far!

This edition of COMMON SENSE provides the text written by Thomas Paine and an Editor's Introduction which covers Thomas Paine's life and his endeavors.The text used in this edition is the second edition of COMMON SENSE published on February 14, 1776 by William and Thomas Bradford of Philadelphia.Some of Thomas Paine's wisdom can be found in these quotes-"For monarchy in every instance is the Popery of government.""Europe, and not England, is the parent country of America. This new world hath been the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from every part of Europe.""When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not hereditary."This book is one of the single most important literary pieces regarding the American Revolution. It's ageless and will always hold a prominent position in the study of American history.This edition is one that I would highly recommend because of the Introduction.

This cd is probably best known for the track "Alcohol" which got heavy airtime in my area.There is a variety of songs on this disc. The only track I don't care for is the bonus track "Cornography."Here is a short commentary on some of the songs:"The World" is an upbeat serenade with a classic country sound."I'll Take You Back" is a fast paced, kiss-off song in the vein of Travis Tritt's "Here's A Quarter.""You Need A Man Around Here" is another Paisley tongue-in-cheek humor song."Time Warp" is the instrumental on this disc. The hectic guitar pickin' is every bit as good as that found on "Nervous Breakdown" from the album "Who Needs Pictures."The vocal harmony between Brad Paisley and Alan Jackson on "Out In The Parking Lot" was excellent. Another of those well-done collaborations that Brad Paisley provides on his albums."When I Get Where I'm Going" is the very popular duet with Dolly Parton. A bluegrass song with heart and soul. It may be the best track on a strong cd!I originally overlooked this cd when putting together a Brad Paisley collection. It's been a pleasant surprise and like Paisley's other albums, you can count on superb guitar playing along with some of the best country vocals available.Brad Paisley is also a great songwriter and the lyrics are always entertaining.If you like the classic country sound from a modern country star, this is another cd well worth the price.

William Greider is an author that I have enjoyed in other books that he has contributed to.In this book he addresses global capitalism from a variety of angles.On the political side of it he explains what former presidents have done to assist multinational corporations' entry into foreign markets. Those nations will often protect their own domestic industries and receive concessions in the form of partnerships for the ability to enter their markets. This contributes to the trade deficit that the U.S. has experienced for decades.From a human rights standpoint he examines the allegations that some governments bar employees from forming unions, and worse yet, physical punishment for various infractions. Global corporations profit immensely from cheap labor around the globe.Another interesting subject was "overcapacity" in automobile manufacturing as a weakness for the car makers. Making more than can be sold is a strategy similar to dumping cheap products on the market to drive out competitors. It also makes cars available cheaper to move inventory."Offsets" are explained by way of Boeing as an example.The chapter about America being the "buyer of last resort" made a lot of sense.Two memorable quotes from the book were;"The great multinationals are unwilling to face the moral and economic contradictions of their own behavior- producing in low-wage dictatorships and selling to high-wage democracies. Indeed, the striking quality about global enterprises is how easily free-market capitalism puts aside it's supposed values in order to do business."-page 170.On corporate power- "The future often seems improbable until it happens".On the topic of a One World or New World Order, I think that this book makes the point that at least on an economic basis, we already have that. We may not have a government ruling the world, but looking at current world events, we have a globally-linked financial crisis!The only criticism I have of this book is the repetition of material throughout the book. It is a very good book on the global economy and various aspects of it.

"Chain of Command" is an investigation into the prisoner abuses at Abu Ghraib and the success in modeling it after the Guantanamo Bay facility.The book discusses the mistakes made in misidentifying people arrested with no charges brought against them. Some of these people were later released due to their innocence.Mr. Hersh examines the report on the scandal written by General Taguba as well as the Afghanistan war report from Hy Rothstein. Some interesting comments about the Afghanistan war from Wesley Clark were detailed.A lot of the book's content deals with Rumsfeld and his missions. One was the quest to wrest control of covert paramilitary operations away from the C.I.A. He also commandeered military decisions from the Pentagon. History has proven that those decisions provided disastrous results.From page 362 Seymour Hersh sums up how the administration operates-"Rumsfeld handled the dirty work and kept the secrets,but he and the two White House leaders were a team."The author demonstrates how the Afghanistan war was used as a stepping stone or launching point for the real,predetermined cause all along-the invasion of Iraq.Mr. Hersh examines how intelligence(lack of it in another sense)is used in this administration. Rather than having the agencies that are qualified to vet,investigate,and decide the accuracy of intelligence examine it; the White House and particularly the VP office will sometimes manufacture it and then leak it as evidence that can be used to justify pre-planned actions.The author investigated the fake Niger-Uranium documents that were oppurtunistic "evidence" of the fantasy WMD's that were never found in Iraq. His tracing the history of that document was quite interesting, although he didn't pinpoint the origin.He also takes a critical look at the policy setters-Richard Perle,Paul Wolfowitz,and Douglas Feith. Perle radically changed foreign policy. Of Perle-"It's an impressive achievement that an outsider can have so much influence and has been given an institutional base for his influence."- an observation quoted on page 193.Contrasted with the current war on terrorism was Jordan's success in dismantling Abu Nidal's organization.On the topic of intelligence...there are some troubling, indirect ties from Saudi Arabia's rulers to terrorist groups. Equally troubling is Mr. Hersh's reports of offers from Syria in assisting with the war on terror that were arrogantly dismissed. Syria is looked at suspiciously while there is evidence that Pakistan has been assisting Iran in it's goal of attaining nuclear proliferation.While the idea of anonymous sources is not ideal, it is understandable when reading the content of this book. Recent history verifies that!Seymour Hersh covers a lot of ground beyond Abu Ghraib expanding into the broader subject of Bush's foreign policy and the complex consequences of different end scenarios of the war in Iraq. I recommend this book and I am looking forward to reading more from this author.

"Flesh and Blood" is Dick Butkus' autobiography from birth to 1997.He begins by telling about his family and some of the mischief he perpetrated as a youth. He tells of his early love for the game of football and an older brother that pursued a career as a player.He writes with a lot of admiration about fellow Bears rookie Gale Sayers and his appreciation for the talents of the great running backs. He also explains his respect for George Allen and his disappointment when George Halas let Allen leave the Bears' staff as a defensive coordinator. Allen had a big impact on the rookie Linebacker and he maintained a friendship after that. George Allen even contemplated a trade for Butkus shortly before the Linebacker retired.Dick Butkus elaborates on the adjustments to college football and academics. He didn't get to play as a freshman for the Illini and schoolwork was more challenging.He tackles some of the false legends regarding his actions on the field."Flesh and Blood" gives you a look at the NFL of old from a player's point of view. Like other hall-of-famers of his period, he loved the game and often-times unselfishly played when he shouldn't have.He sued the Bears to get paid after he had to retire because of his knee injuries. The knee surgeries before the 1971 season were brutal and you have to wonder if they weren't more damaging than helpful.Dick Butkus covers his post-football life at the end of the book. While he played like a monster, he shows a human side as a husband and father.There may never be another Middle LineBacker that intimidates opponents and disrupts a game the way that # 51 did during his short career. This is his story and I enjoyed reading it.

This author does an excellent job of explaining the agrarian revolt which was instrumental in the rise of populism and the People's Party of the 1890's.Mr. Goodwyn details the causes of unrest for farmers in particular. The root cause was financial under the practices of the crop lien system and specie payments. He also details the factor that money played in both major parties of that era with the "gold standard" and "free silver" being advocated by an assortment of national politicians.The author also provides profiles of some of the major leaders of the populist movement- Charles Macune, William Lamb, "Stump" Ashby, S.O.Daws to name a few.I found the information on the Farmer's Alliance and the cooperatives quite interesting. These co-ops introduced wholesale and retail competition to rural areas. The idea of cooperative stores remind me of the old "Farmer's Store" that we frequented during my childhood.The various platforms of the party were detailed as well as the struggles for control of leadership and some of the less than ethical leaders that appeared during the movements short history.Mr. Goodwyn sheds a lot of critical light on fusion as the monumental, internal battle for direction in general. He makes the point that the movement opposed the banking and large business communities, and yet, some in leadership supported the vice presidential nomination of a banker!Another aspect that he examines closely is the differences in strength and specific ideology of populism that was found in individual states.The information on Mark Hanna and the McKinley campaign was timely considering how critical a factor money has become in presidential campaigns. There are historical parallels in the Republican party.There were many memorable quotes in the book, this one from page 269 summarizes the sentiments of the agrarian revolt- "In many ways, land centralization in American agriculture was a decades-long product of farm credit policies acceptable to the American banking community."For a clear explanation of American populism this is the book to read!Populism basically boils down to one Constitutional phrase-"We the people". It's politics for the people with humble roots stretching back to the farmers and rural folk of the late 1890's.

Gene Odom explains how this book came about. After the first of his books was published, he was hoping that someone would write a more detailed account of the band. When those hopes weren't realized, he wrote this book.The Prologue recounted some of the mechanical problems with the plane on the band's last few trips on tour leading up to the crash.This book had a lot of trivia type information about Lynyrd Skynyrd.Some of that information was:*The source of the band's name,which is already widely-known.*Explains what the "bullets" in "Give Me Back My Bullets" actually were.*Who Curtis Lowe was.*The source for some of the lyrics, "Freebird" comes to mind.*The real reason behind the mention of Neil Young in "Sweet Home Alabama" and Young's reaction to it.*The identity of "the Swampers" from "Sweet Home Alabama."*Some of the musical influences on various band members were listed.This is an entertaining book that details some of the growing pains of early Lynyrd Skynyrd. He tells of the revolving door of members and some of the contributions those members made. Paticularly Ed King and Ricky Medlocke, who rejoined the latest version of the band. The many bass players that were involved over time and the dynamic additions of Steve Gaines and the female backup singers.The guidance from Al Kooper in the studio proved beneficial for the band.The rare, close partnership of Gary Rossington and Allen Collins really made the Skynyrd sound what it was from early on.The work ethic was lengendary and brutal. Ronnie Van Zant's financial management skills were detailed. He was the leader and the authors spend more time reminiscing about Van Zant because of it. I don't think that's detrimental to the book.The authors also told of some of the contemporary bands that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ties with, most notably the Allman Brothers Band and many musicians in the area.Another interesting aspect of the band was how Ronnie Van Zant went about putting the band together."Lynyrd Skynyrd:Remembering the Freebirds of Rock" is a no-frills book and it doesn't ignore ugly issues like drug use or the fights. None of the band members were saints. They were a very talented group of musicians that had the right music at precisely the right time.Gene Odom ends the book with the crash, the aftermath, and the events leading up to the reforming of Lynyrd Skynyrd.He also discusses three main theories on what could have caused the airplane to run out of fuel. That's a mystery in itself. The tragedy didn't end at the plane crash as surviving members have suffered various deaths and troubles later on.This is an entertaining biography of one of the classic southern rock bands that would be enjoyed by any Lynyrd Skynyrd fan.

The Book of Jubilees parallels Genesis for the most part.Where it gets interesting is the deviation from Genesis.There are a lot more names of the Patriarchs' wives listed.Some other notable differences:animals spoke prior to the expulsion from Eden;Adam & Eve went from Eden to the land of "Elda";Sabbaths were followed before Moses'time;details of Cain's death,the origin of some wives.This book is from an Ethiopic text.There are references to the "Book of Enoch" which is also of Ethiopic origin.This book is worthy of a read.Is it accurate and truthful? A lot of the passages are plausible. Ultimately, the individual reader will have to decide that.

In THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS the authors view history and corporations, their political influence, and advice from such notable figures as Thomas Jefferson.Jefferson counseled in 1816 that " I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and did defiance to the laws of our country."As usual, Thomas Jefferson was correct.A fundamental topic was the history of charters and the impact of state laws, most notably those of New Jersey and Delaware.The authors quote Daniel J.H. Greenwood who wrote that " Large corporations and Delaware determine the nation's corporate law, and the rest of us are not even 'virtually represented'".Where this book touches on a current issue-the recent Supreme Court decision regarding campaign contributions from corporations.The history of Supreme Court decisions like First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti demonstrates that corporations have enjoyed some puzzling rulings and twisted judicial logic.Another interesting topic is the differing theories of "artificial entity" and "natural entity".On page 54 the authors write "Corporations should not enjoy First Amendment rights that were intended to protect people, since corporations are not people and do not vote in elections."They quote from Thom Hartmann's UNEQUAL PROTECTION on the mystery of Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad. That the ruling is cited as the origin of "corporate personhood" is mysterious in that the decision did not say that. The actual source is the commentary or head notes provided by J.C. Bancroft Davis, a court reporter who was also a railroad board member.The authors also point out some interesting connections between Enron and the Gramms. This book names some of the players in actions that arguably fueled the current crisis.While I found some text that could have been edited better, overall this book is a superbly researched study of corporate political power and corporate crime. Most importantly, this book suggests a wide array of solutions that can be implemented on many levels of citizen involvement.From the local level to the global level, there are solutions for gradually decreasing corporatocracy.

This book is a compilation of columns written by Paul Krugman mostly addressing the economy, warning of impending crises. Another words, a warning from 2004(and earlier) about what we are currently experiencing.The author is highly critical of the current administration's use of tax cuts for the wealthy as a cure for all economic ills.He also looks at companies "moving offshore" and using "fancy footwork" to evade paying taxes.Another subject is the amount of money that can be either a "modest sum" if it's a tax cut for the rich or an "unsupportable burden on the budget" if it's an obligation to retirees like Social Security or a similar program.I can see the point Mr. Krugman makes about better media sources being the business- related media like CBSMarketWatch.He also examines how assorted administration officials, particularly the president and v.p. have aquired their wealth. Their familiarity with Enron-type accounting schemes is, well, accounted for. This is directly related to the administration's hypocritical opposition to corporate and accounting reform.The major ingredients in formulating political debate in our country are :campaign finance, lobbying, and the power of money. Mr. Krugman demonstrates that point very well.He views the California energy disaster as a result of market manipulation by energy producers and traders. Enron was evidently not the only trader involved.Mr. Krugman addresses the story of his connection to Enron as a legitimate business transaction that was used as a smear tactic.I will sum up my impression of the book with this quote form page 129."To an extent unprecedented in recent history, this is a government of, by and for corporate insiders. I'm not just talking about influence, I'm talking about personal career experience."I don't agree with Mr. Krugman's opinions on globalization, but "The Great Unraveling" is an intelligent, clear, and accurate book about Bush's policies and the resulting economic disaster.

CONSPIRACY is one of the more comprehensive books I have read on the murder of John F. Kennedy.I have read many different books on the subject in the last 32 years. Some are clearly cover propaganda and others are the investigative "real deal". Anthony Summers' work falls in the latter category.He spends a lot of time on Oswald and Jack Ruby. He did provide some new material on them both that I hadn't read before.Mr. Summers lists some of the many witness statements identifying the Grassy Knoll as the focus of attention after the shooting. The statements that gunsmoke was present and identifiable immediately after the shooter fled and personal reactions from spectators make a very convincing case for that location of a sniper.What I found even more intriguing was the identity of "Maurice Bishop" and his alleged activities in Mexico City at the time "Oswald" was spotted at the Cuban Embassy there.The link to the anti-Castro Cubans was more clear in this book also.The French Connection section was a confirmation of some information I have read before.CONSPIRACY is on a short list of books that I have read and would recommend on the JFK assassination.That list would include the following books:Mafia Kingfish: Carlos Marcello and the Assassination of John F. KennedyKennedy Contract: The Mafia Plot to Assassinate the PresidentContract on America: The Mafia Murder of President John F. KennedyUltimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK

The beginning of this book was a difficult read. I toyed with the idea of just quitting the book, but finished reading it.I found that the further I read in this book, the better it got!Mr. Ralston has quite a bit of worthwhile historical information as well as his personal views on the World Economic Forum better known as "Davos". Of this group he examined the "normalization of unethical behavior."He touches on the economic policies used by the IMF and World Bank. The author also quotes from a variety of well-known economists, particularly Joseph Stiglitz.A subject that he frequents in the book is the struggle between nationalism and globalism with a few examples of countries that have rejected globalism and been successful with their type of economics. Malaysia being one.I thought that the best chapter was "The End Of Belief",Part IV,Chapter 20. This chapter alone makes the book worth reading.He invokes Theodore Roosevelt and his campaign "against privilege" targeting "men of wealth, who find in the purchased politician the most efficient instrument of corruption." He saw "privilege" as unregulated financial power, speculation, and lobbying. Not much has changed for the better on that front!!Mr. Saul has written a comprehensive critique of globalism and it's failures.Apart from the first few chapters, this is a very good book on the subject.

This book is a history book more than anything.A history of American government and shadow politics.The existence of the Council on Foreign Relations is not in question, they have their own website that anyone can access.Among the historical details that I found the most interesting were:Nelson Aldrich's connection to plans for both the Federal Reserve and income taxes.Woodrow Wilson's candor about the real political "force" in government.CFR member Paul Warburg's quote about a world order-"We shall have one world government whether or not you like it-by conquest or by consent." From page 61.John Kenneth Galbraith's observation about the role of the CFR members in the Kennedy administration.Richard Nixon's trumpeting of "the evolution of a new world order" in a Foreign Affairs article in 1967. This predates the elder President Bush's speech on the same subject. A fact I wasn't aware of.On page 195 Mr. Perloff writes- "CFR conservatism is usually quite selective, turning on only when it serves the interests of Wall Street or globalism."Thereby demonstrating that membership and influence aren't bound by party ideology.Although the material in this book is dated in that it ends with Ronald Reagan's term, it does serve up some interesting lessons on war, foreign policy, and the people making the decisions.For that, more than anything, it's definitely worth reading.

In this book Emmett Tyrrell and Mark Davis explain in great detail why a Hillary Clinton presidency would be so dangerous to the country.They expose her strategy,it's source,and her m.o. both as First Lady and Senator. It's a prophetic description of her as a presidential candidate also.You will discover the cast of often dubious characters who surround her fund raising and campaign team. Folks who won't be seen on camera.Her abuse of Barbara Feinman who ghostwrote "It Takes a Village" is an all too common character flaw in Hillary."The problem is that after a decade of scandals and expose's,there is now so much evidence revealing her culpability that only a Clinton true believer will be satisfied by her protestations to innocence."-page 74.She has a curious habit of letting the skeltons tumble out of the closet and into public view to be debated again. A few prime examples are Roger Clinton's drug use which exposes Bill to possible scrutiny and the other is Bill Clinton's taking a pass on an offer by Sudan to deliver up bin Laden. The authors site a book "Losing bin Laden" written by Richard Miniter that tells how the Clinton administration downplayed terrorism as "criminal activity" in order to keep it on the back burner. He made an enormous error in judgment when he declined the oppurtunity to arrest and extradite a terrorist linked to attacks on the U.S. As a "copresident" this is part of Hillary's legacy too.It's almost comical to read about Hillary's paper written while she was on the House Judiciary Impeachment Inquiry during Watergate.She claims that she was correct about impeachment triggers in 1974,while she took the equally correct and yet opposite view during her husband's impeachment procedings. An example of her belief that she is always correct and those opposing her are part of a "vast right wing conspiracy" against her.A revisit for her health care debacle reveals the steep political price the Democratic party paid for it. They lost 52 seats and the Republicans got a Speaker in the House for the first time in 40 years.All the warts are exposed to the light of day here. Travelgate,Vince Foster,the cattle futures investment,corrupt campaign financing,theft of White House furniture.She is already using the same tactics and risks destroying the Democratic party with her egotistical,self aggrandised run for the presidency.This book is worth the read for anyone that wants to explore Hillary and the multitude of reasons why she should not be president!

After browsing the songs on various "best of" Merle Haggard discs, I settled on "Hag: The Best of Merle Haggard".I wasn't disappointed when I popped it in the stereo.The choice of songs was exactly what I was seeking. No live recordings.The quality is first-rate.The sound of "Workin' Man Blues", "Mama Tried", "Branded", "Okie From Muskogee",and "The Bottle Let Me Down" make this cd worth having for any Merle Haggard fan.I discovered songs that I wasn't as familiar with- "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde" and "Old Man From The Mountain" to name two of them. These songs were as much a treasure as the more well-known standards.Merle Haggard is a legend both for his guitar playing talent and his songwriting for the common man. All of his best work is on this disc.

This book is the best,most complete book on the subject of recent American foreign policy and the war on terror. A keen critique on Bush's domestic policy also.Mr. Bovard goes back in history to the Reagan era and the first war on terror.Following that up with the first Bush's double-crossing of Saudi Arabia when U.S. troops remained there after the Iraq-Kuwait conflict. This has served as motivation for terrorists.From pages 39 and 40-"In 1996 the government of Sudan offered to sieze bin Laden and turn him over to the U.S. government for prosecution.""Maj.Gen.Elfaith Erwa,the Sudanese defense minister,warned U.S.officials that if bin Laden was not taken into custody,he would go to Afghanistan.Erwa told the Wahington Post shortly after 9/11 that the high-ranking U.S. official replied 'let him go to Afghanistan.'"These quotes highlight the prevalent incompetence of the Clinton administration when they blew an oppurtunity. Along those lines,Mr. Bovard gave some details about "Operation Infinite Reach" where the Clintons showed that they could bomb a pharmaceutical factory.This author does an excellent job of exposing the dangers to citizens from the PATRIOT ACT. Freedom is being sacrificed in the war on terror. The Carnivore intelligence gathering system is a chilling component used to spy on Americans' internet usage,particularly e-mail.I found his material on John Ashcroft almost humorous! The former A.G touts the F.B.I's history of "protecting civil rights and civil liberties for all Americans" while being either ignorant of or oblivious to the infamous COINTELPRO program that actually violated those liberties and rights!The Bush domestic policy can best be explained by looking at his(and the Republican party's)two biggest campaign contributors. That would be Exxon-Mobil and Enron!"Bush's views on forcibly spreading freedom and democracy resemble a religious crusade."-page 324. I hadn't thought of it that way, but I think the statement is accurate.If you are looking for an outstanding book on the subjects of foreign policy and the war on terror and it's history, I highly recommend this book!

This book about U.S. Special Forces in Viet Nam is a fast paced and well-written book.Thomas Donahue puts you right there in the jungle alongside himself and other brave soldiers. Very vivid descriptions of the environment and soldiers.Mr. Donahue wrote his book from the viewpoint of a medic in the field.Something of note was that the author served under James "Bo" Gritz.The close relationship between the U.S. soldiers and the Cambodians and Montagnards had a large impact on the author.The Epilogue was a nice touch as the reader can discover what happened to the soldiers after this particular operation.I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a book about special forces operations in Viet Nam.

LIFE IN THE KORNFIELD is basically a trivia book about the television program "Hee Haw" that a lot of my generation grew up watching.It may have targeted a southern country audience, but it had an impact in the rural Midwest as well.Some of the intriguing items that the writers provided were the whole story behind the origin of the program and the little-known connection that Oprah Winfrey had to the program.A surprise to me was the fact that "Hee Haw" went into syndication at such an early stage of the program's existence. Mr. Lovullo explains the circumstances behind that decision.On page 109 Sam Lovullo writes- "We were like one big open-house party, where all our friendly neighbors were invited to come on down and have a good time."That's evident in the shows.There are brief bios of the cast and some of the guests as well as a schedule of the guests and the dates of their appearances.Although the book is brief in a lot of respects, it is a good trivia book for a unique program that has it's part in country music and television history.

This the most detailed book that I have read about Torah observance in the Messianic lifestyle.Mr.McKee discusses the idea that Scripture is often divided-the OT is for the Jews and the NT is for the church. He explains why this is not Biblically correct.He does an analysis of Scripture and the greek and hebrew word meanings in context to verify that the NT does in fact validate following Torah.There are some intersting tibits about how far back in history Torah was followed. Prior to Moses and Mt. Sinai.The meaning of "ekklesia" is covered as well as the meaning of "Torah". While I thought of Torah as "law",that isn't what it means at all.This book is a very detailed study, and the author has obviously done a lot of research.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Messianic lifestyle.

Chalmers Johnson's book "Blowback" got exposure during the 2008 presidential race,mostly from the Ron Paul campaign. This book is a newer release.Mr. Johnson contrasts the differences between "military" and "militarism".Militarism is a companion to imperialism which is the domination and exploitation of weaker states."War is the parent of armies;from these proceed debts and taxes;and armies,and debts,and taxes,are the known instruments for bringing the many under the control of the few."-page 45 James Madison quoted.That quote is eerily relevant when I think about current American foreign policy.Chalmers Johnson takes the reader on a history lesson from Woodrow Wilson's idealism about American imperialism-to Clinton's idea of corporate military welfare-to the privatization of the military and profiteering by more than a few members of the current administration.Troubling also is the revolving door between the military-industrial complex and offices in the Pentagon.The American middle-east foreign policy has been related to oil for the most part. That leads us to the introduction of the influence that petroleum has on military actions throughout our history.Mr.Johnson discussed secret foreign bases and also the behemoth base known as Camp Bondsteel and the monumental expenses related to logistics and the military budget in general.This is one of a number of books that discusses the planning for an Iraq war well before George W's inauguration,as well as the controversial use of "depleted uranium tipped" weapons in Iraq and Kosovo. It's ironic that the U.N. classifies those weapons as WMD's!Two very accurate quotes from this book give the potential reader a glimpse of what you will find in the pages of "The Sorrow of Empire.""When the agents of globalization,the corporations themselves,are revealed as criminal conspiracies to defraud both their customers,their own employees,and their governments,not just the practice but the whole idea of globalization becomes farcical."-page 277."Official lying increases exponentially as imperialism and militarism take over."-page 298.On the subject of empire builiding and the industrial complexes,both military and petroleum, this book is the best that I have read to this point! Chalmers Johnson communicates his points most effectively.

What Greg Critser offers in this book is a wide-ranging critique on the excessive use of pharmaceuticals and how we got to the point we are currently at.Among the things that I gleaned from "Generation Rx":A clear description of what "off-label promotion" is.The connection of conservative think-tanks to the pharmaceutical and advertising industries.Prescriber profiling.DTC-Direct To Consumer advertising."Research Surfing".The rush to FDA approval motivated by quicker profits.Mr. Critser also details some of the many horror stories of side-effects from various prescription medications. Some of the organs involved like the liver and heart.The author also observed the gradual change from a physician-patient relationship to a more complex relationship where physicians are pressured to prescribe meds for ailments that the drug wasn't approved for. The patient also became a consumer by way of DTC advertising.On the political front, Mr. Critser detailed the blackballing of an FDA commissioner candidate by pharma purely based on protecting their profits and ideology.Among the solutions offered by the author were-Transparency by physicians-disclose connections to pharma.Regulation by a rejuvenated,empowered FDA.Separating pharma power from individual health decision.I found the book to be an interesting read about a topic that has been a hot issue for some time. It's suited for the laymen that has an interest in the subject.

I bought this book because of the reviews and cheap price.Two things about this book stand out.1)It's well written.2)There is no bias whatsoever in this book.A prior reviewer complained of Catholic "bashing".I read nothing of the sort.The Catholic church itself was a valuable source of information regarding the location and movements of relics throughout history.The author has done an excellent job covering many of the legends of the Apostles' deaths and burials.He covers the movement of related relics(bodies and parts).Mr. McBirnie travelled to many of the sites that were rumored to be burial sites.He saw first-hand some of the final resting places.Some of the legends will probably never be proven,others such as Thomas' mission to India are well-known.Whether he agrees with some of the stories or not,he covers them.The subjects are more than the Apostles.Included are; Paul,Lazarus,John Mark and James the Lord's brother to name a few.I appreciate that the author devoted a chapter to a particular individual.This is a worthy addition to any library.It's available and cheap.The standard other books on the subject will be judged by.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of it's age.There have been more archaelogical discoveries since this edition was printed.

"The Great American Jobs Scam" is an aptly titled book. Greg LeRoy explains in detail how corporations get tax breaks and related fiscal incentives to relocate or build in predominantly suburban or rural areas. One major ill-effect of that process is lower funding for infrastructure and schools.Sprawl is another adverse side effect.Mr. LeRoy descibes the competition between states and cities for businesses.He detailed how Sykes scammed states and cities to get subsidies for call centers that they would close after short periods of time while outsourcing call center work overseas. They took the money and ran.The author also offers insight on:+ A critical, but helpful analysis of Single Sales Factor(SSF). How it works and what the major flaws are with it.+ One of the lures of exporting jobs and income to foreign nations- businesses pay little or no income tax to state or federal governments. Corporations also hide income made in specific states through loopholes.+ Explains the concepts of "Nowhere Income" and the "Delaware Holding Company Loophole".+ The "demalling" of America as big box retailers reap the rewards of large incentives. The author poses this question on that issue. "Why are we paying to kill downtowns and shutter malls and susidize companies through the back door for their poverty wages?""When we say no to WalMart Supercenters, we protect our Main Street merchants and the community life they foster. We also protect the jobs, wages, and health care of grocery store workers."In addition to detailing many of the scams that corporations use Mr. LeRoy describes how the tax burden falls on the middle class and poor, while schools in poor areas also suffer as a consequence of the giveaways.The author suggests some sensible reforms, some of which are already in use and proven. One being public disclosure of the details of incentives.To read in-depth about an angle of corporate greed and how governmental officials fall prey to it this is the book to read! Documented and written very well.

The chapters in "The Essential Galbraith" are material from various books authored by John Kenneth Galbraith. Some of these book titles are; THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY; THE GREAT CRASH,1929; THE NEW INDUSTRIAL STATE; and AMERICAN CAPITALISM.This book also addressed a variety of economic and societal issues in Galbraith's typical style; easily understood and witty.His writing about the crash of 1929 was some of the best in the book.He addressed the failures of neoclassical economics.Another topic that I liked was his analysis of the great economists and sociologists. Some of these prominent figures that I appreciated the most were Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, and John Maynard Keynes.Mr. Galbraith gave an insightful definition of the term "the establishment". They are those who guide or control the modern corporation and the financial, legislative, legal, technical, advertising, and other "sacerdotal services."Two Galbraith quotes that struck me as timeless are this quote from page 41- "It requires an organization to deal with an organization, and between public and private bureaucracies- between General Dynamics and the Pentagon, General Motors and the Department of Transportation- there is a deeply symbiotic relationship. Each of these organizations can do much for the other. There has been, between them, a large and continuous exchange of executive personnel."This reminds me of that very same relationship between current Bush cabinet members and Wall Street. The benefits are obvious when considering the bailout of last year.This last quote is in context to Keynes and his tarnished reputation after he criticized Winston Churchill's economic policy before Churchill became Prime Minister."When the men of great reputation are wrong, it is the worst of personal tactics to be right.-page 230.I rated "The Culture of Contentment" slightly higher, but this book covers a lot more of Mr. Galbraith's writing and it is educational and entertaining.

In this small booklet David Barton sets out to prove that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is an individual, not a collective right. He proves this rather effectively by examining four items.1)America's earliest legal commentaries.2)Writings of the Founding fathers.3)Early State laws.4)State Constitutions.Mr. Barton provides a large number of quotes like a sampling I'll share:"The first and fundamental rule in the interpretation of all [documents] is to construe them according to the sense of the terms and the intention of the parties."- Justice Joseph Story."The great object is that every man be armed."- Patrick Henry."It is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."- Richard Henry Lee.And there is this word of caution from Noah Webster- "Before a standing army can rule,the people must be disarmed-as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed."As the author accurately states in the booklet, the Second Amendment serves to protect what was frequently termed "the first law of nature", the right of self protection.The only means to "modernize" the Constitution is through the amendment process. Another words, by the people, not by interpretation of the courts.The Second Amendment basically offers a means of protection from a hostile government or home invader.This booklet is thoughtfully written and well documented with large Endnotes and Bibliography sections at the back of the booklet.I highly recommend it.

This book was written after the media circus came to a close. The authors do a great job of starting with a timeline based on eyewitness and earwitness accounts. I believe that they did get a close "fix" on the time of death.This book sheds a lot of light on the investigation and prosecution of the crime. It's hard to fathom why a forensics team wasn't called to the crime scene a lot sooner! The impression one gets from the book is that the prosecution had their killer in O.J. Simpson and any evidence or witness that didn't fit this theory were discounted. The two things that helped immensely in Simpson's aquittal were the gloves that didn't fit and the timeline. "The Source" in law enforcement is quoted throughout the book. This source gives some insight into the police and prosecutors' mistakes,shortcomings and strategy.The theory that Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman were confronted rather than ambushed makes a lot of sense in light of the physical evidence.Another aspect of the murders was the use of two knives likely by two killers. It also makes sense that the victims were moved around at knife-point.The "Leads to Pursue" section was very good. Among the interesting points-A 14 year old boy who claims that he saw three Caucasion men in the alley near Nicole's house at 10:30 PM. This was very close to the time of the murders.A waiter friend of Ron Goldman's from Mezzaluna was mudered shortly before he was.Nicole may have believed that she was pregnant.The lifestyle of the victims may have had a connection to the killings.Could the murders have been related to narcotics? Faye Resnick? Or motivated by jealousy?After reading this book I am convinced that the case could have been investigated better. There are a multitude of scenarios that should have been investigated. I recommend the book as an unbiased investigation into the murders. The authors don't arrive at a verdict,that's left to the reader to determine after assessing the facts in the book.

Susan Kelly has produced a very thoroughly researched and documented book on the subject of the Boston Strangler case of the early 60's.The Preface tells of the circumstance that led to the author's interest in the case.She describes the political and public pressure to solve these cases. The media distortion was a major problem.The author frequently references books by Gerald Frank and F.Lee Bailey as well as numerous newspaper articles.A few things brought up in this book make a very strong case that Albert DeSalvo wasn't the strangler. His confession in it's entirety would have exonerated him. There is evidence strongly suggesting that some of these cases weren't even related by M.O. or victim type.DeSalvo was the "Green Man" guilty of sexual assault but the leap from that to the Strangler was tenuous at best.Susan Kelly makes a strong argument that Albert Desalvo was looking for fame for himself and financial security for his family. He was offered a chance at both by one of his attorneys and he was no doubt coached by nore than a few people, one being the man that killed some of the "Bostan Strangler" victims. Another factor was that details were published in the newspapers regularly. A casual reader could pick up enough information to make a more compelling confession than DeSalvo did on some of the cases.The author examines some of the prominent suspects known to be in the areas of the killings, as well as information on the victims, their actions and crime scene details."The Boston Stranglers" is an excellent book on the subject and characters involved. It is well written and I highly recommend it.

In the Introduction Robert Reich correctly identifies the conservative political machine and how it works. From corporate money to family foundations and the media hacks.While I disagree with Mr. Reich's position on some issues, I agree with his observation on the radical conservatives. As he states, it's not the size of government that's an issue. It's what that government does and for whom that matters most.There were three quotes that Robert Reich used in this book that really highlight some of the problems in American politics.From page 12: "We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both."- Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis.From page 178: "Taxes are what we pay for civilized society."- Oliver Wendell Holmes.From page 179: "The rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more in proportion."- Adam Smith.The author also makes the point that Radcons don't apply their moral compass to the wealthy or powerful.He makes a sensible argument why liberalism should win out while exposing some of the weaknesses in the radical conservative political apparatus.This book can serve as a motivator for liberals and Independents to participate in the political process. That's really where political change starts, the vote and healthy political debate to promote interest in politics.

This book is dated in many respects.The strength of the book is its details, it is one of the few books that investigates the many possible causes of falling wages in the U.S.A.David Gordon provided an index of "real spendable hourly wages" as a realistic measure of employee take-home pay.He looked at "corporate obesity" and investigated the "reservation wage" which is the pay rate that some potential employees may consider to be too low when seeking employment.He also looked at globalization, immigration, and "skills mismatch" and how they may possibly effect wage stagnation.The author argues that part of the problem is the top-heavy nature of corporations."Fat and Mean" is a worthwhile read despite it's age. Another strongpoint of this book is the documentation that Mr. Gordon provided in the book for sources.

This book is a critical view of layoffs from a corporate layoff consultant.What's impressive about the book is how comprehensive it is, including the many effects on the corporations, community, and of course the employees.Mr. Downs looks at many issues:* Profit as the single focal point in a "culture of corporate narcissism".* The influence of Wall Street investors and how quarterly profits always outweigh long term growth.* What part age and pensions play in decisions about who gets the ax.* The three enablers of "corporate narcissism"- the business media, management consultants, and Wall Street analysts.* How mistakes by executives can lead to layoffs while the CEO exits with a "golden parachute".* The steps in "succession planning."On page 203 the author makes an observation that is even more relevant today than when the book was published."The company house organs broadcast the necessity of cutbacks and concessions while top executives haul their loot out by the wheelbarrows."This book is a comprehensive yet readable book on layoffs with some innovative alternatives to layoffs.Mr. Downs has made this subject an interesting one for the common reader. Highly recommended!

"The Roaring Nineties" is a review of economic policy, primarily about the Clinton administration from an insider.Joseph Stiglitz also examines some of both Bushes and Reagan policies . The author is honest in admitting where he felt that the Clinton administration made mistakes.He also writes about how easy it is to reduce the deficit. The problem is that the easy solution does not play well politically.Tax cuts and their effect on the bubble was another interesting subject. There was a very good chapter on Enron with details about its political investments and what it bought them.I don't agree with the author's view of globalization, but he makes a lot of points that I totally agree with. Among them is the policy of higher employment not being the negative economic factor it is made out to be. Another is the subject of CEO compensation and how the shareholder is getting shafted in the process.Mr. Stiglitz shares some of his experiences and opinions regarding the World Bank and foreign economic policy.Overall a good read, but not as good as his later book.Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy

As another reviewer wrote, this book is not a beginner's book on Kabbalah.If you have some understanding of Kabbalah this book can really open up some intriguing subjects!There are many deep concepts in this work, among them are the spiritual aspects of blood and a view on the four creatures of Ezekiel.The power in praying particular Psalms is another concept that I benefited from.This book is like a biology book of the human soul and it's an amazing read!"Anatomy Of The Soul" is the first book by Rebbe Nachman of Breslev that I have read.I don't know that it's a book that every reader would appreciate but as a non-Jew I found a lot of clarity on difficult subjects when I read the book.

As another reviewer mentioned,this book is about the five books of Moses rather than the entire Bible. In my opinion that doesn't diminish the author's work.Mr.Friedman's book offers some possible answers to questions such as;why is the creation of man duplicated in Genesis? The author's theory makes a lot of sense.I'm not very familiar with the "Source Theory",but this book presents a plausible case for it.Some of the features in this book that I appreciate are:The color-coded layout of the book is well done.Some very informational footnotes.A good example is the "Name" and whether or not the Patriarchs knew it.The author sheds light on some Hebrew words and the "punning" or word play used.The use of the tetragrammaton(YHWH)for the Name.The text is easy to read.This book is put together very well and any serious Bible student would benefit from having this book available as a reference/resource tool!

Uriah Smith was a Seventh Day Adventist author who died in 1903.This book is an in-depth study of the prophecies of the books of Daniel and the Revelation of John.His assessment of the book of Daniel was very good. "His prophecy is,in may respects the most remarkable of any sacred record. It is the most comprehensive.It was the first prophecy giving a consecutive history of the world from that time to the end...It gave the first definite chronological prophecy of the coming of the Messiah."He cited his difference of opinion with Joseph Mede and Isaac Newton on the interpretation of the displaced three horns of Daniel's prophecy. Mr. Smith also explained why he believed the little horn was not Antiochus Epiphanes.Another intriguing subject was the daily sacrifice of Daniel 8:13. He exposed a translational error that in recent translations has been corrected. Mr. Smith identified the location of the sanctuary in Daniel's book. He also emphasized the importance of understanding the location of and the cleansing of that sanctuary. There is a parallel to the Biblical Feast of Atonement.Some of other interesting points that are made in the section on Daniel are:The identity of the "Ancient of Days".The identity of Michael the Archangel.Over half of the book is devoted to the study of the book of Revelation.I found this portion of the book to be even more enlightening!Uriah Smith equates the seven churches of Revelation to be seven church ages. He then provides potential eras of that age.On page 390 he wrote this about the overcomers- "They are to have written upon them the name of God, whose property they are.." The seal or sign of the Creator is a fascinating topic. He had a view of the fourth Commandment that I don't recall reading about before. The name of the Creator somehow being written on that Commandment.Regarding the four "beasts" of Revelation 4:6 he stated that the Greek should more accurately read "living creatures"(some translations currently have that rendering) and a case could be made for them being human.He also identifies the little book of Revelation 10:2 with the sealed book from Daniel.He expounded on the "mystery of iniquity" and man pretending to be "God".He shared his views of America in prophecy.On Babylon-"The fault with Babylon lies in her confusion of the truth and her consequent false doctrines. Because she industriously propagates these, clinging to them when light and truth which correct them is offered, she is in a fallen state." Page 653.The Adventist ideas on the cleansing of the temple are worth studying. The location of both the sanctuary and the ark of the covenant are central to their ideas.As someone of the historicist view I enjoyed the book. Those readers that don't subscribe to that viewpoint will likely not care much for the book.The strengths of this book to me were the following;The author analyzed several translations and highlighted some differences.There is a topical index in the back of the book that I found to be useful.This book is arguably the best advocacy I have read about the seventh day Sabbath. That subject is addressed more than once in a compelling manner using a multitude of sources. I haven't read a more comprehensive book on the Sabbath to date,and I have read more than a few very good ones.For a study of the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation from a historicist viewpoint, I recommend this book highly. I was pleasantly surprised considering the age of this book!

Corey Stevens is just one of the newer names you hear in reference to Stevie Ray Vaughan.He isn't SRV and his style is different. I find his music to be vaguely similar to the late guitar hero. He doesn't play the same though and that's not taking away anything from his talent or musical style.The absolute gem on this disc is the title track!It stood out the first time I heard it and it never gets old. Fantastic blues tune!"I Got A Rich Man's Woman" is another notable blues song on this cd. It comes across more "old school" style.Stevens' lyrics are sometimes light-hearted("Headshrinker" for instance), more often dark bluesy material.His voice fits his songs and his ability on a strat is excellent! The production is smooth and professionally done.This was his debut cd and it may have been the pinnacle of his work up to current releases. I haven't heard any other Corey Stevens' tunes that I would rank as high as "Blue Drops Of Rain".

I bought the Logitech LX 700 in Feb and haven't had a single problem with it yet.The keyboard is well-designed,attractive,and very functional.The keys have just the right feel to them.The mouse works efficiently.It is a bit heavy,but as long as it works well,I can live with that!The recharger dock has worked very well.No battery change needed yet and it charges the mouse like it is supposed to.Installation on Windows XP Home was smooth.No disc needed!This is an excellent wireless keyboard and mouse package!

This is the fourth in a series of books by Steven Collins studying the Lost Tribes of Israel.Other than the two books by W.H.Bennett,this book may be the best on the subject.Mr.Collins wrote a book here that is very easy to follow,even with the many name and location changes of the people in question.He does a wonderful job of matching the prophecies of the tribes/patriarchs from both Jacob and Moses to modern-day countries and peoples.The author sheds light on the "lost" history of the Parthian Empire.I highly recommend "Israel's Tribes Today" to anyone interested in studying the Lost Tribes of Israel.

This book reads like a crime novel. Unfortunately, it's a true story about the worst serial killer in American history.The Prologue was an almost "folksy" introduction to David Reichert,the man who would spend 20 years working on the Green River serial killings.Mr.Reichert details some of the problems with the investigation from media involvement to the class of the victims. He makes the distinction between Ted Bundy's victims who were college girls and the Green River victims who were prostititutes,some in their teens. He does a good job of emphasizing the fact these victims were no less human and were missed by loved ones. They were often dificult to trace and sometimes identification was not easy.Another problem the task force dealt with over time was financing. A long investigation was not cheap and there was the perception that the killer had stopped or moved when the discovery of corpses declined temporarily.This aided the decision to cut back on staffing.Another interesting factor was technology. Over the life of this investigation DNA testing and computer technology "came of age" and were instrumental in eventually solving the case.Where these tools helped,the polygraph didn't. Ridgway passed multiple polygraph tests.The tough decision for the County Prosecutor was his decision to ultimately abandon the pursuit of the death penalty in exchange for more details and locations of more victims.Some of the things that this book highlights are the dogged dedication of David Reichert to bring the killer to justice and the heavy toll it took on the team. The strain that the investigation put on Reichert and his family isn't something you would normally think about.If you want to read a book about the Green River killings,I highly recommend this book

In the Introduction of this book Norman Pollack offers this historical definition of Midwestern Populism- "While primarily an agrarian movement, it also contained significant support from industrial labor, social reformers, and intellectuals.""In a word, Populism regarded itself as a class movement, reasoning that farmers and workers were assuming the same material position in society. Thus it accepted industrialism but opposed the capitalistic form, seeking instead a more equitable distribution of wealth."From an editorial in the "Farmer's Alliance" was a quote that sounds relevant for today. "The theory of our government has been and is that the individual should possess the very greatest degree of liberty consistent not with the greatest good of the greatest number, but with the very least legal restraint compatible with law and order."The author explained the lack of cohesion between farmers and laborers.Populism should not be mistaken for a branch of Socialism. Socialism was partly responsible for the passing of the Populist movement.It's interesting that Populists generally held a dim view of both "free trade" and protectionism.The fusion of Populists with the Democrat party was detailed. It was the last gasp effort at survival of the movement.Davis Waite held that Populism alone " was based upon the principles of true democracy.""The Populist Response to Industrial America" is a brief, educational history of the Midwestern Populist movement and it's idealogy.There may be more detailed accounts in other books, but this book has more information than I expected from a small book.

This book as a work of fiction is weak, and not good in any sense. If I were to rate it as fiction 1 star would be generous.The author himself admitted that he released it without refining it because he felt that he had more pressing needs in politics."In regard to Philip Dru, I want to say that there are some things in it I wrote hastily and in which I do not concur, but most of it I stand upon as being both my ethical and political faith."- Edward House, 1916.The most valuable material in this book is found in the Appendices.Those materials came from House's personal papers.The Foreword sets out to illustrate the importance of PHILIP DRU:ADMINISTRATOR as insight into politics because of the author and his influence on Woodrow Wilson. He was an unofficial adviser for most of Wilson's administration and was very instrumental in Wilson's presidential campaign.The fundamental importance of this book is historical and political.Some of the positions that Dru held in the book were later supported by Wilson. Of Edward Mandell House, Woodrow Wilson said this- "Mr. House is my second personality. He is my independent self. His thoughts and mine are one. I would do just as he suggested..If any one thinks he is reflecting my opinion by whatever action he takes, they are welcome to the conclusion." Quote from page 257.The relevance of the book is based on the author and the influence that he had on American politics and one particular president. Due to their close friendship, I would think it highly likely that Wilson read the book.If you're looking for good,well written political fiction this book is not likely to satisfy you.

SEVERED TRUST is a critique of the U.S. medical systems.The author laments the changes in the physician-patient relationship where it went from a more personal relationship with trust and decision-making to a commercial relationship.He levels blame on many parts of the health care system and rightfully so. Some of the usual suspects are present- the insurance companies, pharmaceuticals, the government. We as patients and our physicians bear some of the responsibility as well.I thought his assessment of health insurance companies on page 47 was accurate- " The health insurance industry represents another unnecessary administrative cost. All it does is collect money, keep as much as it can, and dole out as little as possible."One of the provocative issues addressed in the book is the "heroic measures" that oppose a patients intentions in a living will.Another area I found thought-provoking was the low number of autopsies performed after a patient dies in a hospital. He made a very good point why some hospitals and doctors don't want autopsies performed on their patients.Overall a good book about a prominent, current, political issue.As another reviewer pointed out, Dr. Lundberg does have a habit of repeating himself and it can be annoying.SEVERED TRUST is still a book worth reading about health care.

The focus of this book is mostly the crucifixion,resurrection and ascension of Yahushua.As a prior reviewer noted; some of the sources used by the authors are not Biblical,but rather Jewish works.They are listed in the Bibliography.Some of the hypotheses in this book are not provable,like the rod(almond tree) being passed down through generations to eventually become the tree of the crucifixion.There are some real "pearls" in this book though.*The chapter on the location of the Garden of Eden and the four rivers was a new way of looking at the subject.*The authors looked at Jewish laws and customs concerning the red heifer sacrifice in connection with the crucifixion and site.*The day and year of the crucifixion was detailed and they spent some time explaining that the cross and Sunday worship originated from Constantine.The idea that the crucifixion was on a tree does have some foundation.Have you ever noticed the words used in Scripture are "stake" or "tree"?*The striking similarities of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies and the flaming sword guardians of the Tree of Life when Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden.*Some of the physical changes in the environment at Messiah's death and the affect they had on the Centurion helps in locating the actual site and the tomb.It is true that some of these ideas can not be verified with Scripture.I think that the most important aspect of this subject can be summed up from Scriptures quoted on page 106 of this book."Yeshua came to fulfill the sacrificial system of the Law,setting us free from the law of sin and death."This book is a comprehensive work with notes at the end of each chapter.The reader will have to judge for himself/herself the credibility of the authors and some of the sources used.

NEVER DIE EASY is the story of Walter Payton the NFL Superstar, and more importantly, what he was as a man.The book starts out with Walter's last days fighting cancer. The circumstances leading to his announcement of his illness were brought to light.Walter, his brother Eddy, and sister Pam shared what it was like attending school before and during integration. Walter's football talent and personality made the process easier in Columbia,MS. On Walter's high school and college career there is a lot of contributions from teammates that played with him.Walter explained how he approached playing the game of football- "You can't work towards two different goals - individual and team. You have to play for the team goal."The book has shared insights from Bear backfield mates- Roland Harper, Matt Suhey, and Jim McMahon.Walter's view of his retirement, and the failed bid for ownership of an NFL franchise were some things that probably aren't common knowledge among fans. The two issues were directly related. That was a big disappointment to Walter Payton - not being part owner of an NFL expansion franchise. He came very close in St. Louis. If he had different partners, he might have fulfilled another of his dreams.Transcripts of the eulogies were included in the book. His son Jarrett, brother Eddy, Mike Singletary, John Madden, and Mike Ditka all spoke.This book focused more on the man than the player. There are a lot perspectives from his family members and close friends. "Never Die Easy" described Walter's running style. As great as he was on the field, he was even greater as a private citizen, contributing to charitable causes, often anonymously.In the days where contract size and celebrity reign in the NFL, Walter Payton was more like the Bears of old who played for the love of the game.If you want to read about a modern football hero with an "old school" work ethic, this is the book.

I bought this effects pedal new at a reduced price.The Danelectro D1 Fab distortion pedal is much better than my M15 amp's overdrive function!This pedal provides long sustain and the three knobs-Level, Tone, and Distortion work well in shaping the sound. I really like the "dirty" distortion that I get.Don't let the plastic construction fool you. Does anyone actually stomp on these pedals? I find the pedal to be durable and the button works easy enough.Regarding another reviewer's observation about battery inclusion, I didn't receive a battery in the carton either.I have no regrets about purchasing this Danelectro pedal and would recommend it.

THE FALL FEASTS OF ISRAEL fulfills the purpose stated on page 18 of the book- "understanding the fall festivals will enrich the lives and walks of believers in Christ." As a messianic believer, I learned a lot from this book.The authors emphasize that the fall feasts were not exclusively for the Jewish people.Each of the fall feasts was detailed from: the Biblical institution, Jewish traditions and customs, how they were observed in the time of Christ(Yahushua), as well as how they were observed in Biblical times.I found the summation of what each feast represented to be educational. I haven't previously thought of how they connected; repentance- redemption- rejoicing.The authors explain why some call the first fall feast Rosh Hashanah while others call it Yom Teruah.The views of Judaism on the subjects of death and the afterlife were very interesting.These authors go into more detail on circumstances regarding the usage of the Name during Yom Kippur ceremonies.They also list the "four ominous events" that occurred during the forty years prior to the destruction of the temple in 70AD. How that loss of the temple has changed some of the customs. Some of the differing views in Judaism itself are discussed.I appreciate that they quote from the works of Alfred Edersheim, one of my favorite writers.I also found the Glossary of Terms and the many Indexes at the end of the book to be helpful.This book is a beneficial resource for the study of the fall festivals. I appreciated learning some of the Jewish customs throughout history.An excellent book that I highly recommend. If you want to study all the Feasts of Israel I would recommend ISRAEL'S FEASTS AND THEIR FULLNESS by Batya Ruth Wootten.

This book is Joe Scarborough's memoirs from his participation as one of 73 members of the "class of 1994" or the "Republican Revolution" that went to Washington to change it for the better. The mission was only partially fulfilled and after reading this book you will understand why.In addition to being an entertaining read there is some educational information to be found in "Rome Wasn't Burnt in a Day."The seven criteria used by Citizens Against Government Waste in their definition of pork barrel spending is one example.The backstabbing and whining behind closed doors by members of both parties is almost comical untill you realize that was going on with elected officials that should be serving their constitutuents.Another point is that when it comes to "larding up" bills a lot of folks in Washington have no dignity when it comes to a potential oppurtunity.Mr Scarborough makes an interesting point in support of term limits. Those Congresspersons that followed through on their self-imposed term limits were usually more likely to cut spending.The author confirms what many political writers cite as a major problem in Washington, the special interests that buy votes, write bills, and benefit when the taxpayer gets stuck with the bill.Newt Gingich's fall was used as an example of what happens when the mob mentality overtakes a person's popularity. He also casts a little light on the political maneuverings and back-door deals surrounding Gingrich's demise.Joe Scarborough has written an "easy read" that is both entertaining and enlightening on how what happens in Washington can often derail the best intentions of dedicated public servants like some of the "class on '94".

THE JEFFERSONIAN TRADITION IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY investigates Thomas Jefferson and the influence he has had on our American government.Some of the philosophers that Jefferson read were explored. John Locke being one of them.On page 40, Mr. Wiltse observed- "Jefferson combined with the rugged independence of the pioneer American, who had wrested from the wilderness a potential empire, the intellectual independence of the best in eighteenth-century thought, which had cast authoritarianism to the winds."Some of the "Jeffersonian" politicians and writers through history were discussed. Foremost in my opinion was John Taylor "of Caroline". Some of the opinions that Taylor and Jefferson shared were the dreading of capitalism and opposition to the Supreme Court setting aside acts of Congress.Jefferson advocated that government debt should be paid off in 19 years, or a generation. Jefferson also understood that the republic would make adjustments over time.As the author states, "Good government springs from common interest in public affairs." That may be a point in his vision that eroded. Look at the laziness or lack of interest by citizens in participation(voting) today!A few excellent Jefferson quotes are these;"To profit by the mistakes of others is the essential lesson of history.""Let common sense and common honesty have fair play, and they will soon set things to rights.""Responsibility is a tremendous engine in a free government."This is a "dated" book, but even so, it's a valuable lesson on Thomas Jefferson's long-lasting affect on the American government.

This book drives home the point that we live in a world of technology that reaches into our homes and brings with it dangers and difficult challenges for law enforcement. John Robinson is the prime example of what can go terribly wrong when people trust strangers.What made Robinson so dangerous was his skill in adapting his criminal activity while lacking a conscience. He was charming and brazen.The progression of John Robinson from con-man to serial killer was uncommon."Serial killers often have pasts that involve other violent crimes,but Robinson had seemingly evolved toward violence over decades.He'd graduated from one type of criminal to the next.He was always a work in progree."-page 212.Mr.Douglas described the three different types of serial killers.The prosecutions' difficulties presented by multiple jurisdictions was explained. The authors detailed some of the highlights of the death penalty trial in Kansas.This book is hard to put down! The authors have written a fast-paced book with few boring pages. John Douglas is an author that I have come to appreciate for his insights as a profiler.

Thom Hartmann traces the history of corporations, using the East India Company as an example of the power and behavior that they can exhibit.Nothing has changed except the growth of power of the modern corporation.The Boston Tea Party is revisited in light of some antiquated books of that era that the author purchased. This material is intriguing with the circumstances and motivation for the incident.The history of corporate charters was another subject that rarely is discussed. The coporations were held accountable with revocation of their charters.Of course the main bone of contention for Mr. Hartmann is the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company.He goes into great detail about how this case was decided on a small technicality. That being a fence and who could legally count it in taxing the railroad. Corporate personhood and the Fourteenth Amendment defense were never considered or factored into the ruling. The historical significance of this case is based on Headnotes written by court reporter J.C Bancroft Davis.On page 161 the author quotes Theodore Roosevelt from 1910-"There can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains".And on page 75 he quotes Edward G. Ryan Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court who offered these prescient questions-"The question will arise and arise in your day, though perhaps not fully in mine, which shall rule-wealth or man; which shall lead-money or intellect; who shall fill public stations- educated and patriotic freemen, or the feudal serfs of corporate capital.."Those quotes, among many others, emphasize Thom Hartmann's point that there have been a lot of historical figures that distrusted corporate or "monied" power.And they had good reason!Chapters 3 in Part II "The Boston Tea Party Revealed" and Chapter 6 "The Deciding Moment" are great lessons in history and the corporate power grab that set the foundation for the corporatocracy that we currently have.Part III lists the many inequalities enjoyed by corporations. Part IV offers solutions and examples to implement at a local level.On the subject of corporate dominance this book is both thoroughly researched and well thought out.Considering the recent Citizen United ruling, this book is definitely a must read!!

Mr. Faux does a superb job of explaining the NAFTA debacle and it's far-reaching implications for not only America, but our neighbors as well.He describes neo-liberalism as a vision of society in which competition for wealth is the only recognized value and virtually all social decisions are left to unregulated markets.NAFTA was an oppurtunity for America's elites to make the rules in a global economy that would benefit them and their corporate clients.The author details how Bill Clinton lied about getting labor and environmental protections and then betrayed the unions and workers who helped him get elected. This came back to haunt him when he needed assistance on the health care issue. He followed some terrible advice on what to make a priority early on.An interesting tidbit was Ken Lay's connections in the Clinton White House.Mexican governmental corruption and narco-trafficking is another topic that is covered in this book. The known side-effect of NAFTA of stimulated drug trafficking.NAFTA's biggest goal was to chase down profits and cheap labor anywhere in the world. An excellent example is the Sunbeam Corporation and Mr. Coffee.The American workers were dumped for cheaper Mexican labor, and the Mexican labor was eventually dumped for even cheaper Chinese labor. Other human collateral damage were the small Mexican farms.Another aspect of NAFTA is the ever-changing "benefits" of it. First the myth of gaining jobs. Now the "benefit" after job losses is cheaper prices. The abstract model simulations used to promote NAFTA are explained effectively by the author.A poignant view of winners and losers of NAFTA was on page 156. "Both the American, Robert Rudin, and the Mexican, Roberto Hernandez Ramirez, were winners as a result of NAFTA. Aaron Kemp, an American who lost his job at Maytag, and Salvador Chavez, a Mexican who lost his life crossing the border, were losers."Along that line was a priceless quote on page 140. "The most convincing judgment on NAFTA, however, comes from Mexicans themselves, who continue to cross the border in large numbers because they can't support themselves and their families back home."The further merging of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is considered in detail. It's a plan known as the "North American Union". Mr. Faux only uses that term once, but it is getting wider exposure. The author believes that implementation of the plan is inevitable, that's debatable as awareness and resistance increases.As he puts it on page 219- "But the elites of North America are also caught in their own trap.""The Global Class War" is the most detailed and best book on NAFTA and what the future may hold. Highly recommended!

The purpose of this book is to understand the three Daniel Websters- the "Godlike" Daniel, "Black Dan", and the man somewhere in between.Biographer Claude Fuess remarked that it was difficult to uncover Webster's "essential personality".Mr. Bartlett starts the book with Webster's family history, his childhood and ill health. The details of his pursuit of an education. He also and the ability to memorize and recall what he read in a very short time. Along the way, the author details the attorneys and politicians that influenced Webster early on, as well as his contemporaries. He was a powerful speaker even as a student.Some of the author's assessment of Webster shed some light on Daniel Webster.From page 87- "Daniel Webster was a man born to be at the center of things and he loved being there."On Webster's conservatism- "But Webster's nationalism was conservative. He insisted that the political power of the nation through the federal government was limited and repeatedly emphasized the role of local institutions for 'local purposes and general institutions for general purposes'".Some more related issues that Mr. Bartlett addresses are:Webster's exhaustive, unsuccessful pursuit of the presidency and some of the political tactics that he used.His adversarial relationship with some journalists of the day. This led to numerous questionable assaults on his fidelity, none of them ever proven.Daniel Webster and Henry Clay's role in John Quincy Adams securing of the presidency in 1824.Webster's keeping a retainer as legal counsel from a client (Wheelock, the president of Dartmouth)that he later opposed in court on that same case. The ethics of the nineteenth century were very different than those of today.Webster's ties to Nicholas Biddle and the Bank of the United Statesand how it severely handicapped his aspirations for the highest office he sought.Some of Daniel Webster's accomplishment as Secretary of State are examined.Another political position that is puzzling was the decision late in his political career to support the Fugitive Slave Act alienating him from his constituents and a large block of his financial supporters. Financial supporters was another hard to understand point. Webster was a wealthy attorney that died with substantial unpaid debts.The author states on page 209 that "Webster had a double character."This is evident from reading DANIEL WEBSTER. He was a paradox, both as a man and as a politician. This book approaches the subject of Daniel Webster from an unbiased view.

Harry Browne wrote "The Great Libertarian Offer" to express his platform as a Libertarian Party candidate for president.This is a straightforward book that addresses a lot of common concerns of citizens. The complaint of government abandoning Constitutional laws and the erosion of civil liberties are even more relevant today. Especially considering that this book was published in 2000 prior to the PATRIOT ACT.On the Supreme Court Mr.Browne observes- "On the really important matters concerning the role of government, they all agree that the federal government is more important than the Constitution."The author cites an August 1999 Capitol Hill Blue report on Congressional members civil and criminal court litigations that is sobering and worse than I would have expected!He also opines that taxpayer money is basically a tool to enrich the chief supporters of Washington politicians. It's hard to argue with that!Mr. Browne uses every opportunity that he can to advocate the repeal of the federal income tax. This idea has gained some publicity with some of the latest Republican presidential candidates. Along with the proposal to eliminate the income tax, he also offers some interesting perspectives on the national sale tax and the flat tax. He doesn't support either of these alternatives. I think his proposal of eliminating corporate taxes is risky. If you don't either regulate or charter corporations can you trust corporations not to excessively pursue personal wealth and greed?His 4-point foreign policy plan can be summed by this quote from page 115. "Libertarians know that government's role isn't to police the world-or even to win wars. Government's role is to keep us out of wars-and to protect us from foreign enemies, not create them."On crime, the author supports concealed carry laws and opposes gun control.A lot of these proposals are very similar to Ron Paul's.The most notable quote that conveys a great portion of "The Great Libertarian Offer" is found on page 44."Our American heritage is one of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and freedom from a government strictly limited by a written Constitution."I recommend this book for anyone interested in studying the Libertarian idea of government.

In this 48 page booklet a lot of topics related to the Names of the Father and the Messiah are covered. There's more information than what I expected.A variety of sources are used including a large number of dictionaries and Bible commentaries.The author provides a theory for how the Name of Yahweh was removed from the Old Testament.A thought-provoking argument in favor of the Greek not being the original language of the New Testament is offered.The author also exposed some stark mistranslations in the King James Version of the Bible. Two in particular involve the use of the name "Jesus" in place of "Joshua son of Nun" in some New Testament passages.I compared the KJV with 5 other translations and found that the author was correct.The aim of this book can best be summed up from a statement on page 18: "In our search for truth we must retrace our steps and boldly proclaim His true Name, and not follow tradition or erroneous understanding."This book aids the search for the truth in the areas of the most important Names, why we should know and use the Names, and much more in related topics.THE MISTAKEN J is written well and documented in a thorough manner. I highly recommend this book!

I bought these strings after reading quite a few favorable reviews on the internet.I use them on a Douglas Shadow electric guitar.It's a cheaper guitar that has double humbuckers with a three-way pickup selector switch.These strings stay in tune better than the cheaper strings that I have tried.DR Pure Blues have the "warm" tone that I look for.There is no tinny sound that I found with some cheaper strings.I prefer these strings over the other brands that I have tried and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.

In this large book Kevin Phillips takes the reader on a lesson of economics and politics. Much of the history in WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY is of the American variety. He does, however, examine Spain, Holland,and Britain and the commonality these past governments have with the current American political and economic scene. The biggest common thread is the shrinking of the middle class a/k/a stratification of wealth.One of Mr. Phillips observations is that in the 1990s transnational corporations posted record earnings while hiring few Americans. Sometimes slashing employment to boost the bottom line.Along that line he quotes Peter Cepelli, a professor at Wharton School of Business- "Today, a CEO would be embarrassed to admit he sacrificed profits to protect employees or a community."He also describes the shifting of the tax burden from corporations to low and middle income individuals through FICA taxes.His quote on page 242 sums up American politics of the 1890s- "For two or three decades, then, democracy was corrupted at its constitutional core. Control of the Senate secured not just that chamber but the federal courts, the U.S.Supreme Court, and the U.S. Army to the service of American industry and finance."He demonstrates in this book that wealth has been a factor in the politics of the United States from the very start. Finance (banking) has had it's proponents like Hamilton and some presidents through time while it has also had it's opponents; most notably Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.The author takes a look at the worth of some former Cabinet members, Warren Harding's especially, although he wasn't the only president to tap the wealthy for his service.Another interesting point that Mr. Phillips makes is that globalization can be, and has been in the past, reversed.One of the curious inclusions in this book is found on page 71. It's an excerpt of a letter from FDR to Col. Edmund Mandell House. (House is a rather controversial, mysterious figure in American political history and the subject of conspiracy theories. He was a close adviser to Woodrow Wilson during his presidency). "The real truth... is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson- and I am not wholly excepting the Administration of W.W. The country is going through a repetition of Jackson's fight with the Bank of the United Sates- only on a bigger and broader basis."The author also quotes such figures as John Kenneth Galbraith and Thorstein VeblenThe moral of WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY as I take it, is that our economic ills now are nothing more than a recurring pattern that has been experienced by various powerful governments in their heydays. Part of the problem is hubris or the belief that it can't happen again.This is a large book and some sections are laborious to read, but the message of the book is comprehensible and detailed very well. It may just be the most detailed book on the subject of wealth and it's adverse affect on government, especially a democratic form of government.

Bo Gritz stated purpose for writing this book was part autobiographical and part commentary on America's "national-security state" as it existed when he wrote this book(1991).My interest in this book came from reading "Mobile Guerrilla Force" by James C. Donahue.Mr. Gritz is an icon in the Special Forces brotherhood.Among the intriguing experiences detailed in "Called to Serve" was the search for live Viet Nam era POWs in Asia.Military personnel should never be left behind at the end of a war! The author makes a few of the POWs more than a name or statistic by including photos and biographical information about these soldiers as well as the circumstances of their capture.In the chapter "Profiles in Conspiracy" Mr. Gritz provides a commentary on the JFK assassination that I found to be quite interesting.While a majority of the information has been covered a lot over the years, he provides some fairly new information for me.The identity of "Oswald Impostors", the very early date of American military involvement in Thailand were two of those subjects.He references the television program-"The Men Who Killed Kennedy". That show did eventually air on American television after the publishing of this book. Roscoe White as a possible shooter is another subject of interest.He does not claim to have the answers on the assassinations from the 60s but writes- "If I have achieved anything in my contribution to assassination 'lore',it would be to inspire you to question deeply 'the official story' concerning these deaths".From page 552.On the subject of drug smuggling he identifies the complicity of mafia don Salvatore Trafficante in heroin smuggling with some government officials. According to a number of assassination researchers Trafficante was implicated in the planning of the Kennedy murder. It's hard not to see a connection between the JFK murder and heroin smuggling.Bo Gritz has written a large book that carries throughout its pages his dedication to fellow soldiers, his integrity and his strong beliefs.I don't agree with Mr. Gritz on everything in this book, but he has a genuine belief in his positions and it shows in his writing.

This book may be 18 years old, but I found that a lot of what William Greider wrote about are still issues in today's political scene.Mr. Greider observes that some of the problems in American government are rooted in the exclusion of middle-class and unorganized citizens. Corporations, by comparison don't suffer that fate. They are organized and well-represented in government through think tanks as one example.Something that I learned in this book was that financial deregulation started with Carter and the Democrats. Not on the scale of the Republican repeal of Glass-Steagall, but nonetheless, both parties have sold out their constituents when it comes to power and representation in government.Another topic that he addresses is the use of opinion polls. They are easily manipulated.On the wealth factor in policy formation Mr. Greider observes that Democrats have a disconnect from the working class and the poor while Republicans have a goal of "defending upper-class interests of wealth and corporate power." That's evident yet today with Republicans blocking unemployment benefits.A statement that the author made on page 293 reminds me of the Wall Street bailout from a few years ago-"When the big money is in trouble, the Republican Party finds itself acting like a compassionate liberal."Another question posed by Mr. Greider is why should taxpayers subsidize multi-national corporations that move jobs and/or operations to a foreign country that has cheaper labor? He uses GE as an example of "windfall tax subsidies" citing that in the early 80s that corporation had a -90 billion dollar tax burden.His views on the global economy were ahead of their time."The politics of the global economy, more profoundly than any other issue, puts the interest of the governing elites in conflict with the common ambitions of the governed." Page 393.I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to understand what has been and is still wrong with American democracy.For more related reading on the subject I recommend these books also:The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It BackTake This Job and Ship It: How Corporate Greed and Brain-Dead Politics Are Selling Out AmericaCome Home America: The Rise and Fall (and Redeeming Promise) of Our CountryOne World Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global CapitalismDangerous Business: The Risks of Globalization for America

The material used for "Silent Warrior" were the pages that were cut from "Marine Sniper" to manage the size of that first book. So this book is based on much of the same interviews and recollections.I found "Silent Warrior" to be as good or better than "Marine Sniper".The first book may have had more details about some of the shootings, but this book has more details about the sniper's mission-oriented targets and what made them valuable as targets.The noble reason for writing the first book is elaborated on.In "Silent Warrior" the reader gets to see the heroism of Carlos Hathcock when he saved other Marines at his own expense,suffering terrible burns that eventually contributed to ending his career. The character of his sniper-partner John Burke and his heroism in the field was detailed.This book has emotion in the pages. In part because it was written after Carlos Hathcock had passed away. Mr Henderson takes the reader along on fishing trips and ceremonies that were part of Hatchcock's life towards the end.Both "Marine Sniper" and "Silent Warrior" are excellent books and recommended for anyone that wants to read about the most fearsome sniper ever to serve the U.S.A.

The main attraction of this book is the author. John Bogle is an insider with a long history in investment.Throughout the book Mr.Bogle addresses problems in the investment sector. Some are known, some are factors that John Q. Public may not be aware of.His main argument is about ownership. Who controls investments? One would expect that shareholders do. But in reality it's the fund managers. That's the author's point- "owner's capitalism" vs. "manager's capitalism".He provides a witty quote from Herbert Hoover on capitalism. "You know, the only trouble with capitalism is capitalists. They're too darn greedy."Some of the issues that Mr. Bogle covers in this book are:$Accounting fiction $Unrealistic Speculation $Loose Accounting Standards $Restatements of Financial Reporting $Short Term Speculation vs. Long Term Investing $Consideration of Federal Chartering for Corporations.The author highlights the importance of full and fair disclosure.Executive perks are discussed as well as undeserved compensation for CEOs that failed their companies.This book touched on a general, fundamental change in society."In all, professional relationships with clients have been increasingly recast as business relationships with customers. In a world where every user of services is seen as a customer, every provider of services becomes a seller."This is a very good book about capitalism and investing in the markets.The reform ideas are thoughtfully presented by an executive that has been there for decades.

The author did a lot of research using Jewish and Christian sources.The sacrifice for sin was fulfilled with Messiah's crucifixion so a third temple is not needed.That makes the red heifer sacrifice obsolete in my opinion.One chapter stands out in this book. "Though your sins be as scarlet" was very good.The topic of the Eastern gate being the Beautiful gate rather than the Golden gate was interesting.I never heard of Vendyl Jones or the Copper Scroll before I read this book. The search for Temple artifacts and Mr. Jones discoveries and their possible relation to Jeremiah's cave and Hezekiah's exit were very interesting.Another point of interest for me was a quote from The Torah-A Modern Commentary - "Every parchment or paper,religious or secular,on which the name of God had been inscribed was preserved, and when no longer in use,hidden away in storage."This may explain why scrolls were buried and discovered later.This book is easy to read and has plenty of notes.

This book by E.Raymond Capt brings to light some archaeological discoveries that explain what happened to the lost tribes of Israel."The so-called 'lost tribes of Israel' were never really lost.They only lost their identity during their captivity in Assyria." -from the author.The "missing links" in this book are specifically Assyrian inscriptions and cuneiform tablets.According to the annals of Sargon II,he displaced Samaria's citizens(Part of the Kingdom of Israel)with another people."Assyrian artists have given us graphic pictures(inscribed on wall palques)of the subjection of the cities of the Israelites and the deportation of the inhabitants to captivity in Assyria."-from the Preface of the book.Another point of interest is the pre-captivity migrations of Israel. Not all of their travels were associated with captivity.The author details names used by the lost tribes and their movements.He also looks into languages-Welsh,Hebrew,English,and Assyrian.Mr.Capt writes about the Behistun Rock and the work of Henry C. Rawlinson.This is an excellent book for discovering languages,names,places,and the history of the lost tribes!

In "Armed Madhouse" the author examines many current political issues.There is information on the two different plans for the Iraq War and where the plans originated. The consortium of petroleum, chemical, and banking industries all had a hand in one of the plans. That's not common knowledge. The State Department had a 3-day plan while the Pentagon/neo-cons had more of a corporate takeover approach."The plan makes it clear to me that, even if we didn't go into Iraq for the oil, we sure as hell weren't leaving without it."-Page 56.Among some of the topics that I haven't seen adressed much before this book are the following;Ahmad Chalabi and his close connections to high profile policy makers.The history of Iraq, particularly the British rule of that country in the 1920's.A lesson in economics and oil. OPEC membership and production quotas.OPEC's arrangements with big American oil companies.Neo-con think tanks and their connections to Big Oil. Exxon-Mobil and the James A. Baker III Institute is one example.Saddam Hussein's "manipulation of the oil markets" as another motive for regime change.The identities of some of the participants in Cheney's secret energy planning meetings.The author reveals that before his career in journalism he was a "forensic economist". He investigated companies such as Enron and Exxon.Another interesting angle on manufacturing jobs and why China wants them is addressed in "Armed Madhouse".And nobody covers vote fraud as well as Greg Palast does.Another memorable quote is found on page 303. "Hot wars abroad can assist class war at home."The only topic I disagree with Mr. Palast on is suing gun manufacturers for the actions of gun-toting criminals. That's a copout for non-enforcement of existing gun laws.I liked "Armed Madhouse" better than "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy."Palast really hit on a lot of current issues and with his typical sarcastic style.

This book is a commentary on the Dead Sea Scrolls.The first chapter lays the groundwork for the rest of the book by detailing Jewish history and various divisions in Judaism. One topic the author uses as an example is the various views on Sabbath observance.On the source of the Scrolls Mr. Fisdel observes-"In examining the scroll literature, it is not difficult to surmise that the sect members were originally a Sadducee breakaway group." He goes on to write that the group was probably founded by priests and joined by Levites and other Israelites that were unhappy with and wanted to distance themselves from Jerusalem and the temple.On page 49 he offers some insight into the people at Qumram - "The members of the covenant felt that they were the true House of Judah. As such, they were thereby bound to follow strictly the Interpretation of the Law of Moses, revealed and taught by the Teacher of Righteousness."Of all the Scrolls that Mr. Fisdel addressed, I found the Temple Scroll the most intriguing.Some more quotes that provide insight for me; on the forbidding of eating bloody meat-"The blood is life. Only God, as the giver of life has the right to receive it."On the power of the Name of God; "The Name of God is synonymous with the divine Presence and the Power of God." The discussion of the Name in relation to oaths and vows reinforces that fact that God has a specific name.Some more interesting topics in the THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS-UNDERSTANDING THEIR SPIRITUAL MESSAGE were;Ezra and the Great Assembly. The author had some fascinating material on Ezra the scribe.The source for theories about the tribe of Dan and their possible role in end times. Dan may have a role in opposition to God.The Sons of Light and the blessing of the Name being invoked.The Kittim.I appreciated the perspective that Steve Fisdel provided as a rabbi. I learned a lot about the Dead Sea Scrolls and their relevance from reading this book.

Mr. Haskell was an Adventist author so this book is written from a historicist's perspective.Some interesting views on various verses of the book of Daniel make the book of interest.One of those views was on the toes of "iron mixed with miry clay" of Daniel chapter 2. The author saw the mixture as that of church and state, he believed it came from heathen nations.Some intriguing statements were made on Cyrus and the Medes.The story of Cyrus being stopped by "the death of a sacred white horse which was drowned in crossing a river."On pages 88-89 Mr. Haskell describes the Medes- "The Medes were not, however, a new or unknown power, for they are mentioned in the Chronology as descendants of Japheth, and as early as the eighth century B.C., when Israel was taken captive by the Assyrians, they were scattered through the cities of the Medes."On page 256 he had this observation of the Roman church. "The clothing of paganism in Christian garments was never more complete than in the days of Constantine."On the mystery of iniquity he opined that first Christians interpreted the Bible influenced by pagan thought and then the teachings were altered.On the empires in Daniel's vision the author points out that the first three lived on through education or religion when it was adapted by their successors. "Nations and peoples today, unconscious of their origin are perpetuating Babylonian religious customs when they celebrate Christmas with feasting, lighted candles, holly and mistletoe. It is in commemoration of Babylonian heathen gods that they eat eggs on Easter, and even the wild capers of Halloween repeat the mysteries of Babylon." From page 63.The only annoyance I have with THE BOOK OF DANIEL is the size of the print. The way that the book was formatted with two columns in itself was a good idea. The inside column on each page is the author's text while the outside is Scripture text relating to the topic. However,the Scripture text is very small and hard to read.After reading the book I have come away with a few new theories on historical figures, especially intriguing is the story of the sacred white horse. That's something for me to research further.This book serves well as a commentary on the book of Daniel.

This is the second book by Steve Wohlberg that I have read.This book is more comprehensive than "Truth Left Behind."Mr. Wohlberg's books are easy reads.I'll state up-front that I don't agree with everything that he wrote.The identity of Israel in this book is basically replacement theology,or the idea of a "spiritual Israel".When considering that Revelation identifies 12 tribes in Rev.7:4-8(see also 21:12-13)I can't see Israel being a spiritual entity.Enough of the negative...The historicist view is very sensible when considering the source of the preterist and futuristic views of Revelation.I didn't know the history or source of these two theories before reading Steve Wohlberg's books.He exposes the flaws in both theories well.Why would the Church be spared tribulation when countless believers of the past were murdered for their beliefs?Check out "Foxe's Book of Martyrs".Steve Wohlberg does an excellent job in answering that question and more with the Bible.Take the Bible and a knowledge of history and you can learn a lot about the book of Revelation!While I do disagree on one point,I recommend this book as an answer to the fiction of the "Left Behind" series.

This book is basically a collection of articles written by Gore Vidal.It ends with the transcript of an interview of Mr. Vidal by Marc Cooper.Gore Vidal uses a writing style that borders on comical. He has a way of getting a chuckle out of this reader while explaining a serious, if not disturbing subject. And that's not saying that he doesn't take those subjects seriously.His labeling of our economic system as "Golden Calf Capitalism" was original and very accurate in my opinion.He comments that the American empire is founded on a long history of presidential lies. While we are aware of the Bush II lies, he is not the first to use deception about foreign policy. And it's been done by executives in both parties.He lists three great lies that were told by presidents.One area that the author addresses that other writers generally avoid(at least as far as I have read)is the Pakistani connection to terrorism.He rails against stratification in America, calling it a "unique society in which we have free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich." From page 129.And a quote from page 79 reminds me of the recent battle for tax cuts for the rich."The hard Right has no known interest in the people at large, and a reverence for the 1 percent that pays for their journals and think tanks."This is an excellent,brief book about American global imperialism and foreign "entanglements."

Bernie Sanders chronicles his 1996 re-election campaign and his views on various political issues.What sets this book apart from other books in the category is that Sanders is an elected Independent and he's from the unique state of Vermont.Bernie Sanders addresses a number of battles from the Gingrich era.Some of the general issues he addresses are:>"Payoffs for layoffs" for Lockheed-Martin.> The fight over minimum wage legislation.> The identity of a host of "wedge issues" exploited by Republicans.> Why the poor not voting empowers Republicans.> Why NAFTA "was a sellout to corporate America."> How the debate over health care is about economics and class politics.On page 189 Bernie Sanders explains being an Independent in Congress:"I am an independent because neither of the two major parties represents the interest of the middle class and working people of this country."This is a well-written book from a rare Independent Congressman.Another angle that makes this book of interest is that Sanders is a self-admitted "democratic socialist" so that political viewpoint is detailed.I recommend this book for anyone desiring to read about Progressive politics.

This small book by O.J Graham is an excellent history about the hexagram.Some call it the "Star of David" but it actually predates King David's time.The symbol has abundant ties to Astarte and other false gods. Astarte means "star".The hexagram,or "Seal of Solomon" was accepted as occult by the occult world.King Solomon adopted the hexagram when he fell into idolatry.This book researches both the origin and the usage of the hexagram.There are footnotes and Scripture quotes throughout the book.Appendix C is a useful,extensive list of Messianic prophecies in the Bible.I recommend this book.

Mr.Morris wrote a level-headed commentary on Revelation.This is not one of those sensationalistic books!This book takes a futuristic,literal approach to the book of Revelation.There are a few minor areas where I disagree with the author,but overall I found this book to be a very good read.He has some interesting scientific theories that I haven't heard before.Very interesting early church history and geographical information.His theories on the identity of the 24 elders are thought-provoking.He notes the relevance of Zehariah's prophecy(Zech.5:5-11)of the ephah to the black horse of Rev.6:5.Something I had never thought of!I was exposed to some different theories and I came away with some more education on Revelation as a result of reading this book.

There is a disclaimer at the front of the book explaining why most of the author's sources are anonymous.James Risen exposes a lot of alarming activities in "State of War".One is the domestic spying on American citizens by the U.S. government."Unknown to most Americans,the NSA has extremely close ties with the telecommunications and computer industries, according to several government officials." from page 49.The use of "renditions" or international kidnappings by governmental agencies to a foregn ally that is willing to use torture during interrogations.Mr. Risen explains the cause of Paul Wolfowitz' obsession with invading Iraq.Some more tidbits the author shares in the book are:*The less than stable human intelligence source(Curveball)that some high ranking CIA officials relied on as proof of Hussein's bio-weapons.*Who the "Scorpions" were.*Baghdad's desperate,last minute attempts to allow U.S. inspectors inside Iraq to prove that there were no WMD.*How the Department of Defense bears a lot of the responsibilty for the failure of post-war planning.*The idea that lack of post-war planning was a "visionary approach" and who made that bizarre statement.*The squandered oppurtunity to eliminate or capture bin Laden in Afghanistan.This book focuses a lot on Rumsfeld and his many failures after he took over the decision making process on the Iraq war and the war on terror. Mr. Risen also exposes how Rumsfeld militarized the intelligence apparatus. This quote sheds light on some of the activities of Rumsfeld-"Rumsfeld was creating his own secret spy service buried deep within the Pentagon's vast black budget with little or no accountability." - page 70.He also looks at Saudi Arabia's close ties to bin Laden and terrorist groups. He mentions the clearance for takeoff of a plane bearing Saudi citizens after the 9/11 attacks. At a time when air travel was forbidden. I have read of this before, those Saudis may have been stateside for a Carlyle Group meeting?Yesterday's television reports about the findings of why the Iraq war policy is failing have the same reasons/causes as James Risen offers in this book! This book hits the mark on some of the current hot topics regarding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other intelligence related problems.

"Perfectly Legal" is the result of nine years of investigative research by the author. Some sources that he cites are tax lawyers, accountants, preparers, and tax protesters.Mr. Johnson observes that "our tax system now forces most Americans to subsidize the lifestyles of the very rich, who enjoy the benefits of our democracy without paying their fair share of it's price."There are examples of tax "engineers" that for a large fee will share schemes that allow tax evasion by exploiting a plethora of tax loopholes.Of the many means employed to cheat on taxes, the deferral of compensation was an interesting and very common method. The battle over jet-travel perks was another expensive tax avoidance controversy.The chapter "Big Payday" on executive's compensation was an eye-opener.Is anyone worth some of these compensation packages? No! But that's corporate greed in it's most blatant form. The author demonstrates that greed is not owned solely by corporations and is often not easily detected. It is also rarely prosecuted.Some more of the topics that struck me the most are:The myth of the estate tax causing a loss of family farms. Most interesting is the the reason why the rich like Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Bill Gates, Sr. support the estate tax. Mr. Johnston states a disturbing fact- "Some of the biggest fortunes in America have never been taxed, not even once."The hidden side-effects of the Alternative Minimum Tax or otherwise called the "Stealth Tax".How tax evasion vehicles are promoted by tax advisers and large financial firms in an open fashion. Some of those advisers were former IRS employees. The 861 position was investigated.The business philosophy employed by a few notorious CEOs which basically amounts to squeezing the pay and numbers of workers and then rewarding the executive on a ridiculous level.How patriotism (remember the old logo "Made in America?) has taken a back seat while American corporations "expatriate" offshore.The details of oil companies tax dodging schemes such as claiming profits in a foreign country and claiming expenses in the U.S.The "moral hazard" of the limited liability partnerships(LLPs).These partnerships limit the accountability of partners, removing potential incentive to monitor each other."What is in short supply in America is not capital, but income- at least for the half of Americans getting by on less than $28,000 per year- and educated minds. But our policy is aimed at more capital in the hands of the few, not at higher incomes for most so that they can acquire more assets..." Page 312-313."Transparency is good for the taxpayers overall, bad for the favored few." Page 315.Those are a few of the astute observations made by the author.If you only read one book the politics of taxes and the rich, I recommend reading "Perfectly Legal" by David Cay Johnston!

My interest in reading "The Audacity of Hope" was sparked by Mr.Obama's appearance on the Jay Leno show. What makes him interesting to me more than anything else is the image of someone in politics that appears honest.An example is his admission of past drug use as a teen. How many politicians try to pass off past mistakes with memory loss or "I didn't inhale" justifications? This guy is different!While I don't agree with a lot of his views or solutions,I was impressed with how well he articulates his ideas. He has a surprisingly firm grasp on foreign policy for someone with little experience. He explains his opposition to the Iraq War.I enjoy studying U.S. political history so I appreciate his critiques on past Presidents and their policies.Barack Obama is one of the better orators in my opinion,and he is equally effective as a writer.This book supplies the reader with a lot of biographical information on Barack Obama as well as his political solutions to our country's problems.I can't say that I will vote for him,but I can recommend this book to anyone that wants to read about a man that is seen by many as a "uniter" on the national political scene.

I ordered this book as a supplement to my paralegal studies.This book has a wide array of cases with opinions form prominent jurists such as; Cardozo, Hand, and Holmes.The field of tort law is a growing, complex, and changing field of law. The editors successfully covered all of the major sections of tort law. There is a lot of explanatory material that I found easy to understand. It doesn't read like a stuffy textbook. Very well-written and organized.If you are looking for a complete casebook on tort law, this is the book to get!

This book will challenge the traditions of Christianity.The title of the first chapter is "Christianity:not the Original Faith?". The author demonstrates how the original faith was very different than what we have in today's churches. The early believers were known as Nazarenes,not Christians.Mr. Willis explains the "Two Houses" very well. He discusses the names used for the House of Israel which also can be the house of Ephraim or Joseph.He uses Scripture to verify that Torah hasn't been nullified by Yahushua(Jesus). The Bible verifies that the Apostles observed the "Jewish" feast schedule,particularly Paul.Two verses to check out regarding the observance of Biblical feasts: look at what Zechariah 14:16 and Revelation 21:3 tell of the Feast of Tabernacles.Another word rarely given a second thought is "gentile". It may very well be that James,John,Peter,and Paul equated that particular word with the lost sheep of Israel. If they were worshipping false gods they may have been considered gentiles.This is a book that reads easily and has a lot of edifying information. I recommend it.

In "Regime Change Begins at Home" Charles Derber does a very good job of explaining the "regime" and how it is made up of not just the obvious political aspect of government but also the corporate aspect.The audience for this book is a wide one, including liberals, conservatives, and populists.One of the lessons of this book is that regime change has happened in American politics throughout our history. The New Deal programs of FDR and the Reagan Revolution are two examples of citizen voters promoting regime change.There are some sobering comparisons of George W. Bush to other presidents in history. Herbert Hoover presided during a similar, massive loss of jobs. That's not a comforting comparison!Mr. Derber offers some history on the formation of corporate-political power groups such as the Business Roundtable and the Heritage Foundation in 1972.He also traces the regime foreign policy plan that Dick Cheney advocated already in 1992 "for maintaining preeminence, precluding the rise of a great rival power."There are some disturbing admissions from C.I.A. operatives from the 1980's that they were present and sometimes advised on torture sessions in foreign countries. Torture and American politics is not something new!The author also highlights the fact that nearly every nation that we have deployed troops to, or focused military and political interest on, is either an oil producer or the location of a pipeline.Charles Derber exposed another motive for the high degree of publicity and promotion of fear related to the "War on Terror", it's to hide as long as possible the horrific stae of the U.S. economy! The financial crisis in the news this week is precisely what the author wrote about!Two of the many quotes that were particularly good were:From page 159- "All corporate regimes engage in covert war against their populations, since their aim is to redistribute wealth and power form the people to elites.""The war on terrorism is aimed as much at undermining civil liberties and active citizenship as it is at stopping terrorists."- page 236.Despite being 4 years old, "Regime Change Begins at Home" has some website addresses that are still viable. These sites are listed in the Appendix.Charles Derber offers easy paths that anyone can follow to get involved in changing the current government or regime.So the book contains valid complaints about loss of jobs and other pressing concerns, but also a solution to correct or improve the status for every day American citizens

Daniel Altman has written a book about the economic policy of George W. Bush's presidency.It's written for the layperson and it identifies the source of economic theories that drove the economic policies of that administration.Among the observations of the author some that stand out are:$ The wealth of Bush and his cabinet compared to recent administrations.$ Class stratification caused by Bush's economic policies.The chapter on Social Security was very good!Mr. Altman details some of the plans for privatizing Social Security.NEOCONOMY has plenty of documentation and graphics.The graphic on page 280 gives figures demonstrating Bush's failure in economic policy.Overall, a worthy read from the writer that discovered unreported loans in the Enron scandal.

"The Samson Option" is a detailed investigation into how Israel acquired nuclear weapons technology and ultimately, nuclear weapons.The Israeli partnership with the French and later on South Africa on development of those weapons are examined along with some of the scientists involved.The Pollard spy case is the subject of one chapter in the book.The relationship with Israel from an American foreign policy standpoint of administrations stretching from Eisenhower to Bush Sr. is examined. Not all U.S presidents had the same view of Israel's nuclear pursuit. None were willing to admit knowledge of the program or address it publicly. It was considered better to be insulated from the issue or at least ignorant of it.The Israeli lobby and it's financial contributions to presidents from Truman on was discussed. LBJ was definitely not adverse to accepting private,personal cash contributions from anyone.Mr. Hersh mentions a subject that very few authors or pundits will mention-the Israeli Air Force attack on the U.S.S. Liberty in 1967.Another interesting subject in "The Samson Option" is the people who privately financed the operation.There is also a description of Israel's version of Los Alamos- they call it Dimona.Seymour Hersh has provided yet another well-documented exercise in investigative journalism. The subject is one that is just as relevant to foreign policy today as it was when the author wrote this book. Whether you think Israel should have nuclear weapons or not, this book is THE BOOK to read on the subject!

This is the revised edition of the book originally written by Robert LeBow,MD and updated by C. Rocky White,MD after LeBow's death.The authors make solid arguments based on personal experiences in medicine.One objective of the book is to dispel the numerous myths that have been spread to oppose change in health care. The authors identify the sources and motivation for these myths.An interesting idea is the proposal to disconnect health insurance from employment.One of the points that they made regards health care "rationing". We already have that in delayed care of those uninsured or under-insured! They discuss the higher cost of care when people pass up medical care because they simply can't afford it because they are uninsured or can't afford the co-pays or deductible.Another observation was that Medicare needs to be improved or expanded rather than privatized or dismantled.The idea that the market will work things out has proven a fallacy in health care and more visibly- on Wall Street. The common theme in both areas is profit and ultimately greed.Two quotes from this book drive that point home effectively:From page 167-" If there is only one concept that the reader takes away after returning this book to the shelf, it is simply this: A profit-based, market-driven system and equitable, quality health care cannot be, and never will be, compatible. Not now, not ever!"And from page 176-" The [health care] system is controlled by a small handful of powerful people, economic forces, whose profit-making takes precedence over the national, and indeed, the world cause of good health." Rep. John Conyers (D-MI).Another excellent point about our health care system was that if we really do have "the best system in the world", why are so many citizens uninsured? Why do global statistics indicate the opposite in several categories?I have reservations regarding mandated participation. But overall, the solution endorsed in this book is sensible and much better than anything else that I have read about.THE HEALTH CARE MELTDOWN is a book written for everyone. It's sensible and coherent. To date, this is the best book I have read on the subject of health care and it's related issues and solutions.

Mr. Schlesinger's book is good in some regards. But I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the rambling on at the end of the book.The best aspect of the book is the history of American presidents and the process of engaging in war. An example being Truman setting the precedent of "the president possessing the inherent power to go to war."The author effectively explains the differences between preventive and pre-emptive war.The history of close presidential elections was used as a segue to the electoral college topic.His chapter on the electoral college was very good! He detailed the history of and changes made to the electoral college. The "national bonus plan" is intriguing and a possible solution to the anomoly of a candidate winning the popular vote while losing the presidency due to different results from the electoral college.This book was good on some level,but had some boring areas that left me disappointed overall.

Ken Klein has some unusual theories about the false prophet and beasts of Revelation.He has an interesting view of world history. I wouldn't call his approach historicist or futurist. More a hybrid or mixture of the two.Some of the topics that I found helpful were;The Babylonian influence on Judaism.Nimrod's role in the formation of Babylon.The second beast as a system rather than a person.The history of money and international finance in wars and governments.His coverage of the financiers is commonly labeled conspiracy theory. I myself think he exposed a lot of truth on that subject.Some of the negative aspects from my view;The material is dated with the year 2000 for the date of a one-world dictator to appear.Mr. Klein sees the mark of the Beast as a cashless society.Identifies the resurrected Beast(head wound)as the European Common Market.The appeal of FALSE PROPHET:EVIL ARCHITECT OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER will depend on what school of thought the reader has toward prophecy.

In the Introduction Mr.Lynn offers a great quote based on the writings of Alexander Hamilton. "Manufacturing was key to America's independence and security. To be free, Americans must have the power to make what they need, when they need it."For me that was the high point of this book.He makes some sensible points about topics such as theories on the source of Clinton's trade policy with China and the possibility that Robert Reich had a strong influence on it.Another strong point was the relationship between business and foreign policy. Consider the global trade and American imperialism.On the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and the blame it has recieved for economic woes he was correct- "And so the idea that protectionism kills jobs became one of the central founding myths of the modern Democratic Party." But the author doesn't endorse protecting American jobs."End of the Line" examines several business strategies by such famous executives as Sam Walton and Jack Welch. Companies like GE, Cisco, and Motorola are looked at also.One assessment that hits hard at globalism and outsourcing is the ripple effect that can easily cripple a global supply line. The "Lean" manufacturing process aka "Toyota production philosophy" is not a fixall process from my experience with it. The author details some of that process.The book addresses the America-China business relationships with no mention of China holding a large amount of America's debt. I was surprised that it wasn't mentioned!In summing "End of the Line" up, it does have some interesting facts about specific corporations using global outsourcing and linking politics to business. It doesn't touch on the human element like loss of American jobs or the living conditions for some labor being exploited by outsourcing.Jeff Faux's "Global Class War" is a book I would recommend intead of "End of the Line."

What makes POLICE SNIPER interesting is the contributors. Twelve police snipers share some of their experiences in their own words.These marksmen share details of their individual cases that you won't see on the news. They give details on weather conditions, physical strain from maintaining uncomfortable positions for extended periods of time, mental affects of the job, and the rifles used.Some of the actions of the eventual targets were bizarre- from a man that stalked and shot a police officer to a mentally deranged suspect that was released from an institution too early.Carlos Hathcock differentiated between the military sniper and the police sniper. The circumstances and the target area (also called the "no reflex zone"). Police snipers often have less leeway considering that there are usually brother officers or hostages in imminent danger.The Preface accurately sums up the book- "On the following pages are the stories of many of the dedicated law enforcement officers who have served as police marksmen."These experiences make for some gripping stories. This is a very fast-paced book and I recommend it.

David Pollina has written two thoroughly researched books utilizing Scripture and history.He bases this book on two basic premises:"The Bible contains the Word of Yahweh which is authority over any tradition of man."And "Yahweh's redemptive plan is continuous throughout all of human history."The author examines some of the translational errors in some English Bible translations. Translator's can easily fall prey to doctrinal bias.On page 17 he provides a fantastic, yet simple definition of faith."Faith is a lifestyle." Torah and faith are inseperable.One of the fundamental objects of Mr. Pollina's book is to investigate traditions. I have found that a lot of traditions run counter to Scripture.He makes the point that Y'shua was not building a new "ekklesia", but setting out to restore the "ekklesia" or "qahal" of both houses of Israel.Mr Pollina examines difficult passages in the book of Hebrews and Paul's letters in general.Another interesting study was that of the two levels of inspiration of Scripture.He also dates the crucifixion and resurrection, with an uncommon day for the resurrection.The author covers time-keeping, Biblical days, weeks, and months. This is some of the same material that can be found in his other book MOADAI TISHMORU.REUNITING THE COVENANT--PATHS OF THE COVENANT is a book for Messianics, Jews, and Christians alike. The book can be very beneficial to anyone that is seeking the Truth and investigating the traditions of man.

This book is a "light" read.It covers a lot of histroical areas,but not in much detail.The author uses the name "Yahweh".He gives some details on the books of the Old Testament mostly.He writes about the "source theory" and some of the differences in beliefs such as when the name Yahweh was first known in OT times.There are some interesting theories:Zilpah and Bilhah were of "mixed race".The tribe of Levi never went to Egypt at all.The idea that boiling a kid in it's mother's milk was a Canaanite,magic fertility rite.The possible split authorship of Isaiah,1-39 and 40-66.He mentions a few times in passing the lost ten tribes of Israel and the history of Samaria as a capitol for King Omri.This is a book suited to someone wanting a starter type book on Biblical history.I would recommend "Restoring the Original Bible" by Ernest L. Martin to anyone wanting a more detailed study of Biblical history.

Gary Aldrich has written an expose' of all things rotten in the White House. I knew the Clinton administration was strapped with scandals,but this book brings to light some activities that are worse than scandalous!The first problem that popped up was the avoidance of vetting the White House staff. Over time the motivation for non-compliance became more obvious. The eventual leak to the media by a law enforcement source concerning rampant drug use by people working at the White House spotlights one possible motive for non-compliance.The fraudulent double-pay for 25 members of the Clintons' transition staff was not only illegal but an omen for just how corrupt and disrespectful this administration was going to be. "..the Clinton administration was a corrupt disaster beyond redemption or repair."-page 154.Of interest was the lack of forethought when the Clintons had a new telephone service installed and later couldn't figure out how to properly bill the departments. They also had a knack for screwing up traditions like the Easter Egg Roll and 4th of July celebration.They had no concept of security clearance and the importance of it in dealing with the handling of classified documents.Like the first lady, a lot of staffers felt entitled to a presence in the White House. No protocol or respect for the House itself.The legendary story of Bill sneaking out to hook up with a girlfriend at a Marriott Hotel rings true from his past.The cronyism and abusive firings of the Travel Office was typical Hillary behavior.The co-presidency was likely illegal also. "I saw no evidence of a power struggle between the president and first lady. The power was all hers."-page 92.What was most shocking was the treatment of Gary Aldrich by Clinton surrogates like George Stephanopolis. Over time the author has been vindicated, but not before being attacked by the White House,and grilled extensively by the t.v. hacks.I applaud Gary Aldrich for braving the storm and writing a truthful book about the Clinton White House. With Hillary running for president this book is a must-read for anyone with an open mind about what to expect if the two-for-one presidency takes up residency on Pennsylvania Avenue again. And it ain't pretty!

This book is a handy source of liberal quotes.The Table of Contents has approximately 140 categories ranging from "Activism" to "Writers and Writing".Also included are "Shocking and Stupid Quotes From The Right" in 23 categories.Mr. Martin explains in the Introduction why he selected quotes.This is an excellent reference for quotes and would be handy for writing speeches or blogging.One of my favorite quotes in the book was this-"This nation cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor." John F. Kennedy.I recommend this book as a great reference tool.

"This is the Zodiac speaking" is an investigation into the Zodiac killings.What makes this book interesting is the psychological analysis by Mr. Van Nuys,chair of the Psychology Dept. at Sonoma state University.A quote from page 6 lays out the objective of the book- "We will begin this fascinating journey with facts-solid irrefutable facts and nothing more."With that in mind,the authors avoid speculating on the personal identity of the Zodiac killer.The authors explain the differences in the Riverside and Zodiac letters. They make a compelling argument for different writers based on the style of the letters with a different emphasis. By that reasoning,the man who murdered Cheri Jo Bates was not the Zodiac.The Santa Rosa hitchhiker murders were examined for possible links to the Zodiac. They seem to be un-related on various levels.It's obvious from the aftermath of the Stine murder that luck played no small part in the Zodiac avoiding discovery and arrest. You get the sense that he never recovered from his close call with the SFPD immediately following the cab driver's murder."Overall,it appears that Zodiac was deteriorating psychologically and had now relegated himself to engaging in a strange fantasy dance with the media."-page 140.The British language connection was intriguing. Although witnesses state that he had no accent,one has to wonder where that connection came from. Were one of his parents of British origin?The change in tone in some of the letters,notably three from 1974,was examined. This "denoted a change in Zodiac's psyche that probably related to his ongoing and significant psychological disorder." He may very well have had two personalities. Another interesting theory has the change in tone as a positive result of therapy or medication.This book doesn't solve the Zodiac killings,but it does shed light on the psychology and evolution of the killer.After reading this book I have to wonder if Zodiac didn't succomb to suicide or by some means become more psychologically stable?We may never know the answer. I recommend this book as a clear,sensible investigation of the Zodiac murders.

&quot;The Shooters&quot; by Leon Claire Metz is a must-read for any fan of the Old West.The author covers both the popular and relatively little-known gunman in a book that is informative and witty.Some of the characters in this book are the ones you'd expect(Billy the Kid,the James gang,Wild Bill Hockok,the Daltons)then there are others that I knew very little about;Tom Smith,Dave Mather,John Larn.Mr.Metz wrote a book that gives details about the lives of these gunman without making it boring.Great book!This book was what I hoped it would be and I recommend it.

THE BOOK OF REVELATION is a reprint of Stephen N. Haskell's earlier book STORY OF THE SEER OF PATMOS.This book is an Adventist's commentary on the book of Revelation. It's basically from a historicist's perspective.Mr. Haskell provides the meaning of the city names for the seven churches listed in Revelation.An interesting view on the the twelve tribes in conjunction with the 144,000 sealed ones was detailed. Along those lines on page 136 the author stated that "character alone is the basis of the sealing work."His historical assessment of Scripture's affect on government applies yet today. "The exaltation of the Scriptures is always followed by a government which recognizes the equal rights of all men, and by a religion which grants the privilege to every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience." From page 203.On the 144,000 and and their protection he compares that with the deliverance from Egypt. "The deliverance of Israel from the land of Egypt, and their guidance through the wilderness is a type of God's care for His sealed one during the year when the plagues are falling." Pages 277-278.Of Daniel and John and their prophecies he observed that Daniel wrote about history "from the standpoint of nations."John wrote about history from the point of religion and then a combination of a religious/political viewpoint.This book shares a common weakness with other Harvestime Books printed in 1989. Namely the print! The text contains two vertical columns per page. The inside column is the author's text, the outside column is Scripture text. The outer column type is almost too small to read!This is a very detailed commentary with a large amount of Scripture quotes. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to study Revelation from an Adventist viewpoint.

This is the first Chomsky book that I have read and two things impressed me with this author.First, he gets directly to the point.Second and most importantly, Noam Chomsky knows American history relating to foreign policy.The recent example of American imperialism was the last Bush presidency. Mr. Chomsky correctly points out that the quest for American imperialism pre-dates G.W. Bush's presidency.He uses Colombia as an example of the "war on drugs" and it's relationship to foreign policy.Another aspect of the American Empire is the trade angle, especially regarding American banks and oil corporations. Often-times the recipient of American advice or "assistance" end up being looted of natural resources. The author observes that American leaders have prioritized a presence in the middle east(Iraq in particular) motivated by "the great material prize of the Gulf."Chapter 4 "Dangerous Times" was brief, but excellent review of the bloody history of U.S. involvement in Latin America.Mr. Chomsky quotes Alan Tonelson on page 69."What the U.S. wanted was 'economic policies that would enable American businesses to operate as freely as possible and often as monopolistically as possible' with the aim of creating 'an integrated, United States-dominated capitalist world economy.'"That sums up the motivation behind long-standing American foreign policy.The author also observes that "one expects systems of vast power to be committed to lying and deceit." From page 103.I rank this book on par withThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project),Blowback, Second Edition: The Costs and Consequences of American Empireand alsoWashington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War (American Empire Project)Definitely recommended reading!!

This book is a primer on the book of "Hebrews".As an earlier reviewer accurately stated, this isn't a deep study of the book. It's basic and serves well as a primer.One of the neat aspects of this book is the Hebrew perspective brought by a Messianic Jewish author.He shares some very interesting insights that most Christians may not consider.One of those insights is the similarity between the standard Moses raised on a stake(Numbers 21:8) and the crucifixion of Yahusha(John 3:14-15).Both were elevated and those wanting to be healed had to look up at them.Another point of interest that the author shares on page 31 is found in the Genesis narrative, where there is "recorded no evening for the seventh day of creation." A finished, but still open day on the Sabbath.A few quotes from the author stuck with me in reading this book:"Penitence accompanied by ritualistic cleansing cannot bring peace to a sin-ravaged soul. No amount of religious activity will suffice." From page 67."Restoration is accompanied by intimacy, which a breached Holy of Holies has now made possible." From page 108.As a primer I recommend this book. It's a brief but educational read from an interesting viewpoint.

This is the fourth Frank Viola book that I have read.One of the fine points of this book is how the laity/clergy class distinction is not Biblical. As always,Mr. Viola makes his case with Scriptural proof. Mt20:25-28 is one passage.Mt.23:8-12 stresses humility,service."you are all Brothers."1Peter5:1-5 is a fitting passage.Verses 2&3 say the following "Shepherd God's flock among you not overseeing out of compulsion,but freely,according to God's will,not for the money,but eagerly,not lording it over those entrusted to you,but being examples to the flock." That's from the HCSB. That doesn't sound like any modern Pastor that I know!I appreciated his small section on the KJV and why certain greek words were translated the way that they were.I recommend this book for anyone who wants a Biblical look at what "ecclesia" really means.

This book goes beyond the subject of the JFK assassination to a decades-long history of corruption and murder on the national scene.The first part of the book gives examples of Mafia killings using a "nut" or "patsy".Mr.Scheim tells of some interesting ties between D.A. Jim Garrison and members of the Marcello organization.Also of interest was his indictment on bribery charges.The author also details activity involving the Warren Commission.-*Earl Warren's reluctance to be part of the commission.*The prepared book handed out to members by Allen Dulles advocating that all American assassinations were perpetrated by a lone,demented gunman.*Abundant editing and deleting any documentation of Jack Ruby's obvious links to Organized Crime.J.Edgar Hoover's relationship with Frank Costello explains his deep involvement in the cover-up.Mr.Scheim covers Lyndon Johnson and his ability to manipulate people as well as the payoffs he accepted from the Teamsters and Mafia.Financial links of the Sicilian Mafia to the Vatican as well as U.S.banking institutions was also highlighted in the book.This is a an excellent book about the Mafia's involvement in political corruption and assassinations.Mr Scheim has done a good job in researching the subject.

Peter Dale Scott starts out with some definitions in the book.Parapolitics-"describes the intentional controlling behavior, mostly executive and bureaucratic.""Deep politics can refer to any form of sinister, unacknowledged influence."Every chapter is loaded with notes at the end.Scott emphasizes the monumental influence that oil interests have had on American foreign policy actions. This is often hidden from public view.He mentions Nugan Hand bank which was a suspected CIA proprietary that combined drug financing with arms deals. Jonathan Kwitney also wrote an excellent book on Nugan Hand.The CIA connection to opium and other drugs predates Air America and there are fascinating ties to the Corsican and Sicilian Mafias and even some famous American mafioso.The material on BCCI bank was an eye-opener!The author updated his material about the Indochina operations and war from the 1960's and 1970's. He examines the oil companies and their lobbyist's interests in former war areas like Cambodia.One of the quotes that accurately reflects the point of this book is found on page 199. "The apparent involvement of CIA proprietaries with foreign narcotics operations is paralleled by their apparent interlock with domestic institutions serving organized crime.""Drugs Oil and War" is a thoroughly documented book about foreign policy and the history of war, the part that oil and drugs often play in the matter.

This book is a documentary about the abuse,torture,and murder of a three year adopted child in the small town of White Bear Lake,Minnesota in the year 1965.The prosecution of this unthinkable crime was sparked by the birth-mother's search for the first born son that was taken from her in 1961. 19 years later she discovers not only that he died at three years of age,but that there were multiple bruises on his body.What's hard to understand is the fact that many of the Jurgens' family members and neighbors witnessed the abuse and turned a blind eye or "minded their own business". There were a few heroes in the book though, the young woman who reported the abuse to social services, the neighbor who aided the children from Kentucky when they fled the Jurgens, and most of all the adopted brother who testified at the trial of Lois Jurgens.There a lot of questions surrounding the murder case of little Dennis Jurgens. How was Lois Jurgens allowed to not only adopt Dennis,but later the Jurgens were allowed to adopt four more children after the murder!How could Harold Jurgens as a father allow the abuse and torture that inevitably led to the murder?Barry Siegel has written a gripping,detailed account of a case that is sure to leave an impression on any reader.

Glen Greenwald writes from a non-partisan point of view.The title is a rhetorical question while comparing the Bush violations of the Constitution versus what the Founding Fathers wrote and believed.Mr. Greenwald documents some of the prior abuse by past presidents such as Richard Nixon.He also exposed Project MINARET, a program where government spied on its citizens through illegal phone and wiretaps.Bush used fear and tyranny to ignore Constitutional checks and balances,propping himself as a cheap dictator above the law.The Founding Fathers cautioned against giving up civil liberties out of fear and a guarantee of safety. Bush II was precisely the type of "leader" that they warned us of in their writings.The idea that a president can strip American citizens of their due process rights is totally unconstitutional. It's a wonder that Bush wasn't impeached.On page 97 Mr. Greenwald sums up what we should have learned-"We must now see that fear is a by-product of weakness and cowardice. A strong nation does not give up its freedoms or sacrifice its national character in the face of manufactured fear and panic."This is a great book that quotes from many of the Federalist Papers to point out where Bush II & Co. were very wrong.

This is the story of Tommy Lynn Sells who killed in multiple states and the testimony of a 10 year old girl that survived one of Sells' murderous attacks. It was her determined testimony that ended the slaughter.Diane Fanning chronicles Sells' childhood,numerous jail stays,and nationwide travels. He even worked on the road for a few carnivals.Some of his murders overlapped the area and time of the "Railroad Killer",Angel Rosendiz. That caused some confusion for law enforcement early on.Sells has no sadness or remorse. Even killing a freshly new-born baby in the bizarre murder of an entire family! He seemed to victimize mostly younger girls,although victims could be from any age group or gender.Another sad aspect of the Tommy Lynn Sells case is the probability that there are more unsolved murders across the country that he committed that won't be solved. He identifies some photos of victims and the place where the bodies are discovered but can't or won't elaborate details. This is in part due to his heavy alcohol and drug abuse during his murderous travels.Diane Fanning has done her research well and some of the information comes from Sells himself. A real page-turner until the trial part of the book.

Bernard Mayo has provided a lot of material from the pen of Thomas Jefferson in this book.Mr. Mayo narrates the circumstances or gives some background on the subject of that particular chapter.Some of Jefferson's opinion may come as a surprise.Among them are religion, prayer, and fasting.One issue that Jefferson took exception with was the idea of a monarchical government. He was pitted against Alexander Hamilton on a number of occasions and that is detailed in his writings.Among the quotes that I found of most interest were:"As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun." Page 18."Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories." Page 89.As to be expected, Jefferson was eloquent in his writings and as the previous reviewer stated, you can learn what Jefferson's opinion was on a variety of subjects by reading his written word.This is a book worth reading for historical study and a founding father's viewpoint.

The purpose of the book, as stated by the author is "an attempt to redress the balance of information" on Social Security."The plot against Social Security aims to propagate, and then exploit, public ignorance about the program."Mr. Hiltzik does fulfills his purpose very effectively with his research and writing style.He cautions that Bush's proposal would have destroyed the program and replaced it with risk and higher costs. We dodged a bullet when Bush failed to privatize Social Security!Mr. Hiltzik exposes the Bush presentation on privatizing as another stacked deck, scripted television infomercial. He also dispels the numerous myths and outright lies about Social Security and the trust fund.On page 95 the author addresses the correlation between Social Security and tax policy."The income tax rates of the rich have been kept low by four presidential administrations, which have raided the trust fund to pay for federal programs that should have been financed from the income tax levy."Mr. Hiltzik also offers an observation about the people who are always involved in attacks on Social Security."While they claim to be protecting the interests of the disenfranchised, they're really fronts for the wealthy and powerful."He shares a critical view of the program being forecast for "infinity" for Bush's benefit while the 75 year forecast is difficult enough to nail down because of a multitude of variables that change over time.This is an excellent tool to learn about Social Security and the complexity of the program along with investigating a number of changes that could improve or stabilize the program.

I found "The Culture of Contentment" to be a timeless book on the economic and political aspects of American society.Galbraith's humor is present in the quote on page on 27 regarding the philosophy about cutting taxes for the rich being beneficial for the middle class and poor. "The doctrine that if the horse is fed amply with oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows."Central to the economics of contentment is the general commitment to laissez faire. If the market is left alone(unregulated) all will work out for the best in the end. The author defines laissez faire as an attitude and belief. On free enterprise Mr. Galbraith states- "The free enterprise system fully embraces the right to inflict limitless damage to itself."Some of Mr. Galbraith's observations on where corporate authority lies- with management rather than stockholders, is shared by David Cay Johnston in "Perfectly Legal", which I read recently. The author expands on that topic on page 55, "As managers have escaped the control of stockholders,they have come increasingly to maximize their own return."The Chapter "The License for Financial Devastation" reads like it could have been written about the recent financial crisis.The author brings up the point that pundits seldom discuss the critical view that Adam Smith held of corporations.History has repeated itself again lately. In the 80s it was the S&L; bailout. Today it's the rescue of Wall Street. The authors assessment from more than 15 years ago holds true today; "A preventive role by government was not allowed; eventual government rescue was highly acceptable."I found his material on the Council of Foreign Relations intriguing. He was a member of the CFR and he viewed that organization and the Trilateral Commission as well as the Bilderberger group as "recreational" organizations with little actual power. "The more purely recreational or rhetorical activities of the foreign policy community count for little in terms of actual change or effect." He also touched on some of the membership and what the qualifications were for membership as well as the reason for founding the CFR.I enjoyed the book and found that the subject of economics and political aspects of the culture as written by John Kenneth Galbraith was a fast, lively,read. Great book!

In the Introduction to the book Mr. Johnson tells the reader the circumstances of when the term "Blowback" first appeared in a government document related to covert C.I.A. actions of 1953.The author shares his critical view of the American empire and uses the U.S. military bases in Japan and Okinawa as examples.He also examines the joint exercises that various U.S. military organizations perform with some nations known for brutal human rights violations.On accountability he made this observation, "The Pentagon's most recent route around accountability is 'privatization' of it's training activities."Another aspect of American imperialism is the actions of the International Monetary Fund that often leads to political instability.On financing he discusses the enormous sums of money in the U.S defense budget to maintain access to Persian Gulf oil and why that's a priority."The American Empire has become skilled at developing self-fulfilling and self-serving prophecies in order to justify it's policies." -page 92.No truer words have been written about the subject.He offers up an accurate assessment of free trade, particularly with China. "The second aspect of human rights in China we must recognize is to ensure that poor working conditions and prison labor in China (and elsewhere) do not end up destroying the livelihood of American workers."Chalmers Johnson clarified the financial as well as the military aspect of the American empire citing the positions of Adam Smith and John Hobson."Smith and Hobson both believed that finance capitalism produced the pathologies of the global economy they called mercantilism and imperialism."He observes that capitalists are seldom happy with being capitalists and would prefer being monopolists, inside traders, or usurers.After reading all three of Chalmers Johnson's trilogy books, I regard "Blowback, Second Edition" as the best.If you want to understand how the American empire works and why blowback happens, this book is a "must read".It covers the many aspects of American imperialism and in an easily understood fashion. Destined to be a foreign policy classic, if it isn't already!

Jess Walter has written an unbiased book about the standoff on Ruby Ridge.Paranoia and fear played a large part in the conflict, for both sides.The author detailed the religious influences,beliefs, and motivating factors for the Weaver's move to Idaho. A simple weapons charge could possibly have been beaten and the whole situation avoided.But for the F.B.I. to have such unconstitutional rules of engagement was arrogant and incompetent at best. The Justice Department report admitted that while the F.B.I. continued it's attempts to cover up and promote those that were most involved. I was amazed to read that the Marshals that were involved in the original shootings weren't interviewed by the other law enforcement agencies and the false reports of the Marshals being in danger after they had in fact,already retreated."Every Knee Shall Bow.." is a book I recommend if you want to read about the tragedy of Ruby Ridge.

The Septuagint is the Greek translation of the original Hebrew Old Testament text.There are quite a few English translations to choose from and most of them are newer.THE SEPTUAGINT BIBLE was discovered by a friend of mine and has been a great resource in comparing various Bible versions.The Introduction and Foreword to THE SEPTUAGINT BIBLE are packed with information such as:-The differences between the editing of Muses and that of Pell previously.-Some translational differences of Thomson and Brenton.-The source used in the Septuagint and where those texts ended up.-The source text that Thomson used was also identified.This translation was originally published in 1808 after being translated by Charles Thomson, who was formerly the Secretary of both the Continental Congress and the regular Congress until 1789.The language is older English, but I found it more readable and less stiff than the "Olde English" of the contemporary King James Bibles.There are some footnotes from Charles Thomson in this edition, but they are apparently not as extensive as those in other editions. The Apocrypha are not included in this translation.The editor,C.A.Muses explained why he restored some material to the Book of Esther that Mr. Thomson had previously omitted.This edition also has the verse numbers in the text parenthetically rather than in the margins. The Chapter numbers are in Roman numerals, which takes some getting used to.Another interesting detail is that the two books of Samuel and both books of Kings are labeled I Basileion-IV Basileion. This is the Greek word that was the common title for those four books.One interesting footnote is found for Ezeliel 10:13."And in my hearing these wheels were called Gelgel."The context is the vision that Ezekiel saw of the heavenly throne and the cherubims with the wheels associated with them.The footnote is "Chaldean Galgal,wheel or rolling thing."Galgal is an interesting word study in it's own right!There is a note after the 13th verse of Jeremiah 25- "From this point on, the older Septuagint text of Jeremiah differs markedly from the order of the presently received text revised in the Christian era by rabbinical scribes." The original order is listed in that footnote.The wording of Deuteronomy 16:1 was unique and clear, "Observe the month of New things, and keep the Passover to the Lord thy God, because in the month of New things thou didst come out of the Land of Egypt, by night."I highly recommend THE SEPTUAGINT BIBLE for anyone who wants to read the Septuagint in English. This book is a treasure to read and the historical information in the Foreword and Introduction is invaluable!

This is much more than a handbook. It's an exhaustive resource book about spiritual warfare.Dr. Murphy organized this book very well. It can easily serve as a reference or guide on spiritual warfare.His definitions were clear and I found them helpful. Examples would be Demonization vs. Demon possessed, and Power encounter vs. Spiritual warfare. Truth encounter is something I hadn't thought of.On page 98 the author sums up spiritual warfare concisely- "...it is important to understand that spiritual warfare is a multidimensional sin issue that plagues all believers."Christians can be afflicted by demons.Dr. Murphy cites many personal experiences delivering Christians.He also cautions the reader to beware of getting in over their head.The surveys on Scripture regarding deliverance and demonization was informative and his writing style kept this reader engaged throughout the book.Some of the other subjects that I found educational and helpful were:- The chapter on foreign gods in the Old Testament.- The chapter on New Age religion was fascinating and an eye-opener. This is some of the best material on that subject that I have read lately.- There is a difference between being demonized and having a mental illness. Sometimes they are connected but not always. The author shared his personal experience and explained the difference well.- Some of the signs that indicate a demon is present in someone.- Ways to induce demon manifestation and alternately how to shut them down.The book also contains prayers for both the individual and a group.This book is heavily researched, has approximately 50 pages of endnotes, an Index for Scriptures, and a Subject Index at the back of the book.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a comprehensive manual on spiritual warfare.

Judge Andrew Napolitano has written an excellent book about governmental abuses of constitutional rights.The Judge defines in laymen's terms the fundamental differences between the theories of natural law and positivism. The author subscribes to the natural law theory.He shares some of his personal experiences from the bench.The bulk of the book is a commentary from a conservative point of view on the abuses of rights by the government in areas such as Eminent Domain.He tracks how Eminent Domain has devolved from uses for "public use" to "public benefit" to ulimately for "private use". Something that was strictly for public use is now abused for private gain.He details some of the shocking, unconstitutional abuses by Janet Reno when she was a State Attornney in Dade County, Florida and later as U.S. Attorney General. Particularly her use of the "Miami Method" of prosecution and the coercion and outright abuse of a suspect's wife. She serves as an example of how the justice system sometimes circumvents individual's rights and breaks the law.The author assesses the right to possess arms as a fundamental human right, guaranteed by the Second Amendment. This right has little to do with hunting, it's basically about self-defense. He cites some examples from history of human rights abuses after citizens were disarmed.Judge Napolitano provides a scathing critique of the PATRIOT ACT and the Bush administrations misuse of the term "enemy combatant" in light of the Constitution and the rights therein.On secret legal proceedings the author has this opinion. "When the federal government decrees a 'special interest' case and then escorts the public out of the courtroom, it smacks of Stalinism."He also examines how John Ashcroft usurped the Constitution's Sixth Amendment guarantee of client-attorney priviledge."Constitutional Chaos-What Happens When the Government Breaks It's Own Laws" is highly recommended reading for anyone that cares about freedom, individual rights,and the Constitution.

I became aware of this book from footnotes of another book I recently read. Mr. Kwitney also wrote the Introduction to "The Hoffa Wars" which was authored by his friend Dan Moldea."Endless Enemies" was printed in 1984, but remains very relevant to U.S. foreign policy yet today.The fiascoes examined in this book are a matter of history repeating itself today, only with some new characters in the cast."The corruption of foreigners cannot be accomplished without the corruption of Americans." That quote from page 94 all too often accurately depicts the results of foreign policy.Jonathan Kwitney exposes how Exxon, Mobil, and British Petroleum(Known than as Anglo-Iranian Oil) in collusion affected the overthrow of Iran's Premier in 1953 and what the motive really was. He got ahold of "journalist" Kenneth Love's correspondence with Allen Dulles regarding his involvement in the action.He examines the power and influence of major oil companies dating back to pre-WWII agreements between Exxon and I.G.Farben. He details how oil companies in particular have set the agenda for U.S policy abroad often at the expanse of the taxpayer. That brought to mind the secret meetings between Cheney and the energy companies early in Bush's first term.I found his investigating of the heroin sources and C.I.A.(Air America) transportation of it fascinating.He used the Dulles brothers as prime examples of the allegiances of international businesses, large law firms like Sullivan & Cromwell, and the C.I.A. in setting foreign policy and covert actions."Endless Enemies" is a revealing, critical look at U.S. foreign policy in several countries covering many administrations. This is one of the more impressive books on the subject, I would put it in the same league as Chalmers Johnson's books. It's great as a history of this subject.

This book wasn't as detailed as I would have liked.But the author did cover a lot of topics on the Bible and it's history.One topic of interest was the oral transmission of the deeds of the Messiah before they were written.On page 54 he addresses the language; "Aramaic was apparently the spoken langage of Jesus and his disciples, including Paul. Hebrew did continue to be the language of liturgy, of law, and of biblical scholarship"He states that Aramaic was sometimes referred to as "Hebrew".On kabbalah he wrote- "For the kabbalah and its practicioners, the Tetragrammaton is the key to the mystery of all Being, divine or created, but also the key to understanding the meaning of the Bible." From page 83.On the subject of translational differences between the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, the author touches on it lightly.On the decision of which manuscript was chosen in translating the Latin Vulgate he offers this - "Over and over it became necessary to choose from among two (and often more) conflicting readings in the various manuscripts, of which only one could be the right one, and to decide which of then to print as the authoritative text." Mr. Pelikan uses that as an example of the difficulties that arise in translating manuscripts.His material regarding Erasmus' dissatisfaction with his translation hearkens to the "Erasmus addition" of text in I John 5:8 that was left to corrupt the KJV. He tells of the history of that addition, it's removal, and subsequent re-insertion.Overall this book was written well, but I think it's more of a primer or very basic approach to textual difference.

While this book doesn't identify the actual shooters in the assassination of John Kennedy,it offers up an immense volume of information about the C.I.A.-mafia partnership regarding assassination attempts directed at Fidel Castro.The planning,execution,and failure of the Bay of Pigs operation are detailed.The book really focuses on the C.I.A.'s activities and participants,especially in the Caribbean. Air America and the Corsican mafia are also discussed. Various agency business connections and financial ties are detailed.You will read about characters such as Robert Maheu,Howard Hughes,E.Howard Hunt,Mitchell WerBell III,Frank Sturgis,"Maurice Bishop", and a myriad of other interesting people that were in some instances heavily involved in the intelligence community. In addition to that aspect, the authors investigate the mafia activities in Cuba and Haiti and how they particpated in projects with the Agency, sometimes without Kennedys knowing about it.The authors documented this book well.On the subject of the JFK assassination,this is one of the better books available. The details in the book make it an even better book on the subject of secret wars and how participants re-surfaced in the Watergate scandal and even later in politics.

This book is a series of first-hand experiences from Special Forces soldiers in the field.The author provides some tidbit-type information about Special Forces,procedures,weapons.The S.O.G was mentioned in some of the accounts,there was some additional detail about them in the section about Charles Berg.Mr. Halberstadt gives some history and origin of the Special Forces. I found that to be educational.The origin of the green beret as headgear was interesting.The details about the ethnic makeup of the allies in Viet Nam was really good. The differences and animosity between the Montagnards,Nungs,and South Vietnamese added responsibility to Special Forces units that utilized the various groups as team members.This book covers the Special Forces from Viet Nam to Iraq,with over half of the book deicated for Viet Nam era experiences.The last chapter was about "sprayers" found in Iraq and the possible connection to WMD's. That's something I haven't read before!This book is a compelling read! I am intrigued by the S.O.G. warriors. Consider that these volunteers were "off the books" and on their own, many of them disappeared and with no official explanation.

Mr Wohlberg has written a book that clearly exposes the errors of the Left Behind fictional books and movie.He shows that there is no pre-trib rapture.It's not a secret rapture either.Reading this book has led me to consider the historicist view as opposed to the futurist view of Revelation.Reading the Bible in context and studying Daniel(7:25 in particular)with Revelation from a historical standpoint confirms for me that Mr. Wohlberg may be "on point" with this book.He has taken apart the the theories of the Left Behind series without slandering the evangelists behind the books and all the while basing his theory on the Bible!

"Conservatives Without Conscience" was written after "Worse Than Watergate". I prefer the first book over this one. This book had some boring material about the different factions in conservatism.John Dean educates the reader on the neo-conservative ideas. They moved from the Left in the 60s and 70s. They differ from other conservatives with these ideas;an American empire is plausible,promotion of American values around the globe by military force if necessary,the U.S. should enforce peace around the world,and military-imposed nation building.Another interesting topic was the mixing of religion and politics. This grew from the Carter election sparking the birth of Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority and eventually giving way to Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition.Cal Thomas is quoted saying "the marriage of religion and politics almost always compromises the Gospel,for politics is all about compromise."page 98."While authoritarian conservatism was growing in force in Washington for a decade before Bush and Cheney arrived at the White House,their administration has taken it to it's highest and most dangerous level in American history."-page 117."Conservatives Without Conscience" is an indictment of the Republican party's corruption like the K-Street Project and Jack Abramoff. Dean's criticism of Cheney is followed by a particular quote that validates concern. "....given the world that we live in,that the president needs to have unimpaired executive authority"-Dick Cheney.I believe that John Dean has accurately depicted both the president and vice-president's relationship and their personalities.The author goes a little too far when he validates the Clintons' claim of a "vast Right Wing conspiracy" though. That's a well known Clinton cop-out that gets trotted out whenever they back themselves into a corner.Overall "Conservatives Without Conscience" is a good source for understanding the many facets of conservatism in the Republican party,some of the Figures,and the history and changes of the movement.

This book is the best on Revelation that I have read to date.It's refreshing in the regard that the authors are not pushing the rapture on the reader.Their approach to studying Revelation is a new one for me and the style of writing is quite clear.I recommend this book to anyone that wants to study Revelation.

Lou Dobbs has written a common sense,straight-forward book about the cause of economic woes for the middle class."America has become a society owned by corporations and a political system dominated by corporate and special interests..." That statement is painfully true when you look at lobbying in Washington and the exorbitant salaries and bonuses of the CEO's. A case in point being the retirement package given to the retiring Chairman of Exxon/Mobil.Other topics in the book are:Illegal Immigration and the cost relating to education and insurance/medical care.Free Trade and "outsourcing".Failure in Education.Health Care and Insurance.All of this ties directly into the increasing burden on the middle class.I recommend this book.It is well-written and an easy read.

William Greider exposes the part of capitalism that doesn't always get much exposure. The environmental as well as human aspects.Among the issues that Mr. Greider addresses are wealth inequality in American capitalism. He links inequality to employment and wages.On page 111 he quotes John Maynard Keynes on investing-"The actual, private object of the most skilled investment today is 'to beat the gun', as the Americans so well express it, to outwit the crowd and to pass the bad or depreciating crown to the other fellow."Sounds an awful lot like what happened to many investors in the current crisis.He addresses job growth and advocates capital flow to "smaller enterprises" rather than larger entities.Another interesting issue is the advice that Morgan Stanley gave to corporate executives. Among that advice: to avoid unions, pensions, and health care benefits for the employees.An example that corporate profits will always trump wages and anything else important to the worker.An area that causes more problems is the gradual re-merging of monopoly corporations.On page 227 he asks a fundamental question-"The missing political question is: why are the corporate 'persons' treated so much more generously than living, breathing citizens, especially when the corporate privileges often are used to damage the interests of the human 'persons'?"Mr. Greider offers some good solutions. Among those are profit sharing and employee ownership.A good book on the subject of capitalism and a critical look at various aspects of it.

Economics and money books can be dry and boring. Not this book!In typical Galbraith style, he simplifies the topic and delivers it with wit.Mr. Galbraith discussed various monetary standards and some curious items used as "money".Among them were; land, gold, silver, and even cigarettes.Some of his observations provide excellent quotes like these examples:"If all else fails, immortality can always be assured by adequate error." From page 178."Common sense is another term for what has always been believed." From page 235.The author provided an excellent assessment of fiscal policy in American politics from the Revolution to the Clinton era.In my humble opinion this is the best book that John Kenneth Galbraith wrote.Educational, entertaining, and highly recommended!

Rabbi Joseph Telushkin states his goals in the Introduction of BIBLICAL LITERACY. One of the major goals is to make people read the Old Testament themselves and in the process learn more about the relationship between family and human relationships to the Creator. His hope is to maintain the status of the Bible as "the most influential book of the next three thousand years." So this large book is a type of commentary.Throughout this book the author mixes in some interesting bits of trivia that often get easily passed over. An example is Sarah's age at death being listed. She's the only woman in the Bible that had that.On page 53 in regards to symbolic irony for Jacob's deception"The man who deceived his blind father now finds himself deceived by his uncle during his hours of 'blindness." That's referring to the switching of Leah for Rachel in the marriage tent.A definition that was very helpful was that of an "oracle" contrasted to a warning.There are a few topics where I disagree or am not convinced of Mr. Telushkin's accuracy;One obvious point is his interpretation of the Suffering Servant passage of Isaiah chapters 52 & 53. I see it as individual identity.He addresses a controversial subject of polygamy and how it has been dealt with throughout Jewish culture and Jewish history.I would have liked to see something solid about Jeremiah's place of death.I was expecting a lot more bias and doctrinal insertion in this book.He's actually quite unbiased on a number of subjects.Page 513 provides a straightforward statement on the "613 Commandments"-"The Jewish teaching that the Torah enumerates 613 commandments does not in fact appear anywhere in the Bible." That number comes from the Talmud.He gives a possible explanation on where the extra Jewish festivals come from.Another interesting topic is the legal leniency and wranglings in the past relating to Sabbath years and debt collection.While I don't agree with some of his opinions, Mr. Telushkin deserves credit for highlighting aspects of the Bible that Christians and Jews alike can benefit from.A strongpoint of this book is the sharing of Jewish history and teachings of the sages of Judaism's past.If his book directs readers to more study of the Old Testament, he accomplishes his objective.BIBLICAL LITERACY is large book that is worthy of reading.

"Zebra" is focused on the related crimes in San Francisco. But the "Zebra" crimes were actually happening state-wide. They were racially motivated, a psychopathic race to kill enough innocent victims to rate the killer as a "Death Angel."Some of the killers were intellectually deficient and almost always chose the victims at random, on impulse. They were encouraged to seek out children or women as victims.True to the expectations of some investigators, the killers were cowards and offered no resistance when arrested.The name "Zebra" was inspired by the "Z as in Zebra" radio channel that was reserved for the investigation. Although there are other racial connotations for the case name.The statistics in San Francisco were 23 assaults resulting in 15 deaths and numerous survivors scarred in one way or the other from the assault that they survived. Mr. Howard does a commendable job portraying the victims as everyday people rather than merely numbered victims.I echo the surprise of the other reviewer that this case hasn't recieved more attention over the years. It was a huge case,more like conspiracy,of murder throughout California that had as amany as 70+ victims!Clark Howard's "Zebra" is a very good read for any true crime reader.

This book is offered as a teaching tool on the history and economic issues of the 1890's.Mr.Dighe chronicles the interpretations of "The Wizard of Oz" as imagery of politics and money by various writers starting with Henry Littlefield in 1964.The author cautions that there are subtle differences between the movie and Mr. Baum's book. The color of Dorothy's shoes is one example.Mr. Baum's political leanings are a relevant topic of this book. They are basically an unknown. Mr. Dighe suggests that Mr. Baum probably didn't intentionally write "The Wizard of Oz" as political/economic allegory. But the book fills that role surprisingly well!The first chapter explains money and national finances in easy terms. Some of the subjects in that vein are; the gold standard, gold reserve, and fiat money. They are all efficiently defined.The story of "The Wizard of Oz" is printed in this book accompanied by numerous footnotes that are educational and interesting. Those footnotes detail some of the interpretations from authors like Henry Littlefield, Hugh Rockoff, and Ranjit Dighe himself among others.These interpretations are speculative, but some of them are glaringly obvious. The green in Oz's temple for the color of money is one.He includes William Jennings Bryan's speech at the end of the book. I have mixed feelings on Mr. Bryan. While he advocated the federal income tax(I don't care for that)he has his spot in history that was well-earned by his presidential campaigns and eloquent speeches.This book addresses a fascinating topic. The question of whether L.Frank Baum intended for his book to serve as an allegory for the politics of the 1890's is one that each reader will have to answer for themselves.

I found this book to be informative and well researched.The author examines the diversity of premillenialist's beliefs as well as dispensational beliefs. The key issue in "On the road to Armageddon" is their support for the state of Israel,particularly in light of their Biblical interpretation of Armageddon.Some of the highlights for me were:The Plymouth Brethren. Who they were and the manipulation of the crucifixion date in relation to Artaxerxe's decree.The source of the rapture theory. Most likely from Margaret MacDonald, a "prophetess" from Scotland. John Darby's oppurtunism as an early proponent of the rapture theory."According to recent theory,Darby returned home totally against the so-called outpouring of the Holy Spirit but convinced that Maragaret MacDonald's view of the rapture was true."-page 24.Premillenialism as well as postmillenialism and other branches of eschatological belief are based on interpretation of Scripture. This paves the way for "proof texting",cherry-picking and avoidance of interpreting Scripture while considering context.The effect that "higher criticism" had on strenghening the dispensational movement.The origin of identifying Scriptural "Gog" as Russia and why it is very likely wrong.The Presbyterian church's missionary work among Jews between the World Wars draws a striking paralell to messianic judaism of today. Retaining Biblical holy days and Old Testament law(Torah) while accepting Yehusha as Savior or Messiah. The author provided a historical overview of messianic judaism as well.This is the first I have read of a potential,future "bloodless" temple.I find it hypocritical that any Christian would advocate a future temple that would reinstate animal sacrifice.An excellent book on the subject. "Forcing God's Hand" by Grace Halsell is another very good book on the subject,but I would recommend this book more.

This is the second book from Adin Steinsaltz that I have read. ("The Thirteen Petalled Rose" being the first).He was proficient at explaining difficult concepts in a manner that was understandable.Some of the deepest topics are a bit clearer from reading this book.Trials and suffering,repentance are just a few of those topics that I view differently after reading this book.The chapters on "The Trials of Life" were very good!I learned a lot about the connection between wisdom and understanding.You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate some of Adin Steinsaltz' teaching.If you want to read about various aspects of life from a Hasidic perspective, this book is one I recommend.

Pete Brewton was an investigative journalist for the "Houston Post" newspaper. This book is the result of his extensive investigation into the Savings and Loan bailouts in multiple states including Texas.When some of his articles weren't published he concentrated on writing a book on the scandals related to the bailouts.This reader can't help but notice some parallels with the TARP program. The taxpayers pay for a bailout and the money is seldom traced. Somebody makes out really well. On page 380 there is an observation that could have been written in the Fall of 2008-"the taxpayers are now bailing out the savings and loans that were bailing out big banks and insurance companies."This book is a "Pandora's Box" with connections running through bankers, politicians, power-brokers, CIA assets, and the Mafia.A lot of the characters are from Texas, but the financial crimes covered the globe with offshore accounts and foreign governments involved. The Iran-Contra affair was but one activity that had links to the S&L; institutions that are the subject of this book.As the title suggests, Mr. Brewton did examine the elder George Bush's connections to people involved in the activities at the financial institutions. There is actually more material dealing with sons Neil, Jeb, and George W. than with the Bush patriarch himself. Some Bush- Saudi connections were exposed and these resurfaced later.This book turned up some interesting connections between Carlos Marcello and figures in Texas.Among other subjects, the CIA's aviation assets were investigated regarding drug smuggling and gun running.Pete Brewton did a thorough job on a complex conspiracy with a large cast of characters, most of them villains on some level.While dated, this book puts the Savings and Loans scandal in a much brighter light.

This book written by Nesta Webster is not a typical sensationalistic book.While this work is dated,it's also loaded with a lot of information about well-known and little-known secret societies.This author investigates the origin,founders,and in some cases the actions of these organisations.The French Revolution being one.Not all of these societies are bad and that is expressed in this book.This book is an excellent introduction to the study of secret societies and I recommend it.It's written well and despite it's size,I found it hard to put down.

This book is well-written and gives a lot of insight on Reagan's campaigns for the presidency.Mr.Kuhn was involved in those campaigns dating back to the 1970's.The author covers Ronald Reagan's two terms in the White House very well.He also details the President's travels and some of the political strategies that came into play with Gorbachev in particular.If you are a Reagan fan this book is a great read.I would recommend this book over Peter Wallison's book.Mr.Kuhn was around Ronald Reagan a lot longer and covers a longer time period.

THE KENNEDY CONTRACT is another book from John H. Davis author of MAFIA KINGFISH which I reviewed two years ago.This book is more recent, four years newer to be exact and in that time some more information has come to light.The book starts off with mob attorney Frank Ragano's claims relating to a mafia hit on JFK.Mr. Davis addresses J. Edgar Hoover's actions before and after the assassination. Internal FBI memos make it clear that Hoover was privy to key information in both time frames. Possible motivation for why Hoover took actions/inactions with the knowledge that he had is examined.The mafia connections involving the usual characters is investigated. Players such as Jimmy Hoffa, Santos Trafficante, Carlos Marcello, Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie, and Johnny Roselli are discussed. There were a lot of provable connections even as far back as 1963.I don't recall previously reading some of the material like:Karen Carlin's statement in 1992.The "mock target practice" by unidentified men on the grassy knoll November 20,1963.A theory about who may have placed the "pristine bullet" on a gurney at Parkland Hospital.Mr. Davis criticizes the illegal removal of the President's body from Texas and explains why the autopsy was sloppy.The author addresses Jim Garrison and the movie "JFK" and why Garrison was not trustworthy, and the movie was mostly fiction.Two noteworthy quotes are found on pages 257 and 266 respectively."If Jimmy Hoffa, Santos Trafficante, and Carlos Marcello concluded that President Kennedy had to go they most certainly had the guns, the guts, and the power to get the job done." The author makes a very convincing case for that."Although there still remain many unanswered questions about the assassination, I believe it is now reasonable to affirm that thirty years after the murder in Dallas we at last have an inkling who was ultimately responsible for the crime."This book also contains 34 pages of Source notes and an Index.This is the best book on this subject that I have read so far.

This massive tome didn't answer all of the questions or solve all of the mysteries surrounding the JFK assassination, but it did address some discoveries that followed the recent release of de-classified government documents.Thom Hartmann and Lamar Waldron did a terrific job of explaining what fueled the coverups for so many decades.It's been widely suspected for years that organized crime was deeply involved in the assassination but unable to pull it all off or plan it themselves. Well, this book explains why and how they used different participants, some of them unwitting, to kill John F. Kennedy. Another revelation was the two other planned attempts to kill JFK.In addition to the mafia aspects of the conspiracy, various intelligence and other government agencies' connections are detailed also. There was far more going on regarding Cuba than I read about before!Some of the material is repeated in parts of the book. I appreciate that. With a complex conspiracy like this some details bear repeating.ULTIMATE SACRIFICE builds on various theories from the past. Waldron and Hartmann did a lot of research and the results are one of the best and most current books available on the subject!The hype from some of the earlier reviews is more than justified.I suggest this as one of the "must read" books about the JFK assassination.

"The New American Militarism-How Americans Are Seduced by War" is an analysis of the subject from multiple viewpoints. Andrew Bacevich examines American militarism from the point of: politicians, the military, evangelical Christians, and society in general.In the Preface the author is quite candid and humble about himself, his idealogy, and some of the experiences that helped form his positions."Some will misread this as cynicism. It is instead the absence of illusion."He doesn't attempt to lay blame.The chapter on the neoconservative idealogy (Left,Right,Left)was very good. Some of the leaders were "devout Wilsonians, devoted to the proposition that American values are by definition universal values." That's an accurate assessment of exporting democracy."The conception of politics to which neoconservatives paid allegiance owed more to the ethos of the Left than the orthodoxes of the Right.On the Right they hoped to find the oppurtunity to create the alternative perception of reality necessary for fulfilling their radical aspirations." One of those aspirations was the global empire that we have now.In analyzing the view of evangelical Christians on militarism he made this truthful observation on page 124-"The relationship between Christianity and war has been a tangled one. Despite Christ's admonition to love one's neighbor and to turn the other cheek, Christians historically have slaughtered their fellow men, to include their fellow Christians, in breathtakingly large numbers."Some Christian advocate war more than others.Some more subject matter that I found revelatory were:*The author compares current and past presidents foreign policy to that of Woodrow Wilson.*The analysis of the Weinberger and Powell Doctrines regarding pre-conditions for engagement.*Where the idea for prosecuting two wars concurrently originated.*The quote from a Pentagon General assessing Rumsfeld as someone who has "done more damage to the country than we will recover from in 50 years" was sobering.*The "priesthood of strategists". Who they are and how deeply they have affected military strategy .*A comparison of former presidents and how they viewed and sometimes utilized the military.Mr. Bacevich offers some sensible solutions to the current problems of American militarism, one being to utilize the National Guard more at home for Homeland Security activities. Border Patrol would make sense."American policymakers should employ force only with reluctance and after the most careful deliberation....and it should do so with one eye cocked on the home front, wary of claims of military necessity being used to compromise our civil liberties."My interest in Andrew Bacevich's books was kindled by watching an appearance he made on Bill Moyer's program to promote "The Limits of Power." This book is one of the best I have read in some time.I'd rate it highly and in the league of Chalmers Johnson's books.

What this book adds to the mix of JFK assassination books is a Viet Nam angle from a foreign policy standpoint. The idea that South Viet Nam president Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother (Ngo Dinh Nhu) could have participated in the plot before being assassinated themselves sounds far-fetched....until you consider the "Iron Triangle" and his brother's connection to the heroin industry.A major divisive issue is what exactly was JFK's role in the coup that overthrew Diem?To be fair; whether JFK approved of the executions or simply abandoned Diem, would it make much difference as a motivating factor for retaliation?This all leads to the constant player in this cast- the U.S Mafia.They did business with the Marseilles syndicate of the now famous heroin "French Connection". So their motivation could very well have been on a business level in addition to a personal vendetta.Some things that I found really interesting in TRIANGLE OF DEATH:* The KGB's own investigation into the shooting and their opinion of Oswald as a potential agent and sniper.* Debunking Christian David's identification of the "assassins".* The identity of the assassin who was deported within days after JFK's murder. The authors did a lot of research on that particular topic!* The French intelligence agency's query about the deportation of that assassin.Where this book may have come up short:- I agree with the opinion that Matthew DeLuca stated in his review of this book about the direction of the fatal headshot. It came from the front. The author's argue that it came from behind.- They also reference Bill Bonanno who suggests that Oswald killed officer J.D. Tippitt. Too many eyewitnesses to the Tippitt murder contradict Bonanno's theory.From page 157 the authors wrote about something that gets overlooked sometimes-"Ultimately, of course, no book written on the Kennedy assassination will ever be more than a writer's hypothesis."That's true and there is no shortage of books available on this subject.Some of the material covered in this book is new, specially CIA document 632-796. I think that some of this new information (some released in 2003) may fill in some blanks. Will we ever really know all of the details? Maybe not, but we may get a clearer picture over time. This book provides some interesting theories to consider.

This book is a collection of different types of ancient writings.Some are gnostic while I recognise others that I have read in "Lost Books of the Bible" or as individual books."The Didache" is one of those books.One of the motivations for my purchasing this particular book was the inclusion of "The Coptic Gospel of Thomas".The author had this to say in the Introduction of this book-"Some scholars have maintained that the sayings of Thomas may be closer to what Jesus actually taught than what we find in the New Testament..." The book has a gnostic point of view though. I don't subscribe to the gnosticism,but this particular book does mirror the Gospels in some respects.Some more books I found interesting in this collection were:The Proto-Gospel of James.This book focuses on Mary prior to Messiah's birth, with James supposedly being the author.The Shepherd of Hermas."The Shepherd was a popular book among Christians of the first four centuries.Written by Hermas,brother of Pius,Bishop of Rome during the first half of the second century."This book addresses ethics.The Letter of Barnabas.It was part of the Codex Sinaiticus(4th century greek manuscript).More or less a Christianity vs. Judaism theme.With this type of literature the reader needs to be aware that some of it is similar to Scripture while some of it is definitely not.As a collection I rate this book slightly better than "The Lost Books of the Bible".

The author states that the goal of this book "Is an examination of how one company has single-handedly altered our expectations of what we deserve as consumers and what we will tolerate as citizens."One of the points Mr. Dicker has demonstrated effectively is that the consumer gets low prices while employees get low wages often without insurance. Another troublesome aspect of those low prices is the source of those low price items. Suppliers are forced to outsource to be able to provide goods at a low enough price for WalMart.Those cheap prices have other costs that aren't visible.Another complaint Mr. Dicker addresses is where the WalkMart employees go for health insurance when it's not provided by the employer.An intriguing bit of information was the leaked internal WalMart audit from the Summer of 2001 printed by "the New York Times". This was used as an example of how cost obsession can subvert labor standards.There was some history of WalMart and Sam Walton. The growth of the company, the history of some retailers, a comparison of WalMart with A&P.; This was all very interesting as a history/trivia lesson.Paul Samuelson was quoted on cheap labor vs. wage loss- "Being able to purchase groceries 20 percent cheaper at WalMart does not necessarily make up for the wage losses."The importance of Chinese labor to WalMart is discussed.John Dicker got a lot of solid points across with this book. I do think that he could have done it without some of the language though.

Yacov Rambsel shares some of his discoveries of the Bible code in the biblical Hebrew language.He finds the name "Yeshua" throughout the OT.He doesn't use the code in any attempt to prophecy the future.He details how the names are located in the related Scripture.Aside from the work on the code,I also found some of the issues he touched on very interesting.From a historic point he mentions Bar Kochba and what the Romans did to the Temple Mount in AD71.Mr.Rambsel shares some new thoughts on the purpose of Elijah and Moses' appearance on the Mount of Transfiguration.Relevant to that topic he discusses the links between Yeshua,Moses,and Elijah in the code.The author's brief examination of the events of MT.27:50-54 was something that I hadn't considered.This was the resurrection of saints that happened after the crucifixion.This is a thought-provoking book and it's easy to read.

This book was written on the verge of the Soviet Union's collapse. With that in mind, some of the Senator's views are dated."The Price of Empire" is in part a narrative of J.William Fulbright's political career. It makes for interesting reading.He laments the financial costs of the arms race for both sides and tends to be more inquisitive rather than rhetorical about nations commonly labeled as our enemies.My favorite chapter was "Our Militarized Economy." Some of Senator Fulbrights concerns about the economy became reality in 2008.He shared some of his views as a dissenter of Viet Nam and was highly critical of people like Richard Perle who were hysterical about a Soviet radar installation in the 1980s.Another timeless topic is the political power of corporations. The author wrote a bit about that influence in Eisenhower's presidency.On page 155 he made this observation-"There is a tendency in all societies for people with power to exploit whomever they can exploit.."He shared some helpful insight not only on Viet Nam but on American interventionism in general offering this advice on page 167-"We should intervene only when-and without question-our own real interests are threatened."This is a very well argued book whether you agree with the author or not.I prefer this book slightly more than the author's older offering "Arrogance of Power."

Mr. Mitchell is a talented true crime author! "Evil Eyes" was my first exposure to Coral Eugene Watts. As Corey Mitchell accurately pointed out in the book,Coral Watts is barely known. The media really didn't cover one of the most prolific,dangerous serial killers in American history.He definitely killed in Texas and Michigan, it's also very likely that he crossed into Canada and killed in Ontario.Coral Watts was the "Sunday Morning Slasher" of fame in Michigan.What is surreal about the Watts case is his sentencing in Texas. A state known for executions in capital cases was facing the very real probability that it would be releasing a serial killer and awarding him for time off for good behavior in prison! A contributing factor was the plea agreement granting immunity for confessions and locating victims' corpses.Mr. Mitchell includes the transcripts of Watts' confessions. You get the feeling that after confessing, Watts "clammed up" or he could have solved more murder cases that matched his M.O.He also devotes attention to the survivors and victims' families and some of the key figures in related organizations.The author exposes the F.B.I. profilers error in some of their profiles regarding serial killers, particular race."Evil Eyes" is a very well-written true crime book and I highly recommend the book.

This book is based on the Ethiopic book rather than the Slavonic, which is known as "the Secrets of Enoch"."The Lost Book of Enoch" is a much better,readable version.Jude 14 tells of Enoch as a prophet.So,an Enochian book did have an influence on the NT.Discoveries of copies of the book among the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran prove the book was in existence before the time of Christ.Mr. Lumpkin has added scripture quotes where there is a relationship to the text in this book.Editor's notes and Author's notes are also helpful,and explanatory.This book is prophetic of Jesus Christ.It is also apocalyptic.You can read the names of the fallen angels and the mighty archangels.While this book is not included in the Bible,it does have value in giving us a glimpse of the beliefs of the early church and before that even.I haven't found anything in this book that contradicts Scripture yet.I recommend "the Lost Book of Enoch" by Joseph Lumpkin over any other book of Enoch.

This is the second book from Ernest L. Martin that I have read.Like the first book(The Secrets of Golgotha),this one didn't disappoint.Mr.Martin covered a lot of topics that I found to be very interesting.He discusses how Jerome altered the order of the New Testament and why he did it.Particularly why he put the Pauline epistles in front of the General epistles.Mr.Martin wrote about rank concerning Paul,Peter,James(the Just)and John.He provides some fascinating information on the canonisation of the Old Testament.The number of OT books was 22.A book for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet before some of the books were broken down into smaller books.Some more highlights of the book are:Matthew, the author of the Gospel-his name and what he was.Date of the writing of the book of Revelation from historical events.John's relationship to Jesus and what his heritage may have been.An interesting view on what "bind" and "loose" may mean in MT 16:19.The diverse authorship of the Psalms,particularly from Hezekiah.The "cloak" that Paul requested of Timothy in II Timothy 4:9-13.The principle of progressive revelation-teaching that begins with elementary matters and proceeds to the more sophisticated.These are just some of the many interesting topics in the book.The Index at the back is useful.It's a "must read" for anyone wanting to study the canonisation and order of the Bible.I recommend this book and "The Secrets of Golgotha" also written by Ernest L. Martin.

"The K Street Gang" is the sordid tale of how some Republican leaders were involved to varying degrees in the Abramoff scandal.It all started in the early Nineties with Tom Delay gaining more power.In the words of Tom Delay quoted in the book -"We say to the lobbyists,'help us'. We know what we want to do and we find the people to help us do that. We go to the lobbyists and say 'help us get this in the appropriations bill'."The fundamental problem for the Republican party in 1994 was summed up by the author on page 59. "And so the GOP has come to adopt the theory of interest group politics, which dictates that politicians should seek to please the specific interests that brought them to power and not promote national goals that affect diverse groups."Anotherwords- in too many instances they simply sold out for money instead of serving their constituents.The most well-known Jack Abramoff scandal was the ripoff he perpetrated on some Indian tribes with the aid of Michael Scanlon.But this book sheds light on some more disgusting activites such as the Sun Cruz Casino scam, lobbying for homicidal dictators, paying journalists for favorable articles, and his mutually benficial business relationship with sweat-shop owner Willie Tan.If you want to read about some of the sleazy underbelly of Washington D.C. and some of the greedy lobbyists, this book examines the biggest of them all.

While Bill Gertz does an effective job at highlighting the miscues and mistakes of the Clinton administration when dealing with the potential threats of terrorism and handling of intelligence data in general, he totally misses the effects that U.S. foreign policy have had on terrorism. There is a long record of regime change instigated and in some cases, accomplished by the CIA.The Clintons didn't take advantage of oppurtunities to locate bin Laden, but to be fair, what have Bush and company achieved toward that end in the last 7 years?The author seems to have a positive view of the PATRIOT ACT. Intelligence at the cost of personal freedom and Constitutional liberty may be a fair trade for some, anyone that values the Constitutional rights of America's citizens will disagree.This book is more of an apology for Bush's failures by blaming the Clintons and other Democrats. It's neoconservative propaganda.

Mr. Martin has written arguably the best book about the crucifixion and it's site.He does an excellent job of using Scripture and rabbinical sources to pinpoint exactly where the crucifixion happened and why other famous sites are incorrect. He discusses laws and customs of that time,both Jewish and Roman, and how they factor into the crucifixion."Without the camp" and the crucifixion site can only be one direction and he gives a lot of concrete reasons why this is true.Mr. Martin goes into vivid detail about the crucifixion and why Messiah died so quickly compared to the two criminals that were crucified with him.The section about the fulfillment of the Suffering Servant in Isaiah 52:13-53:12 was excellent and puts Messiah's suffering in a new light!There are a few tidbits of little-known information about Judas Iscariot and the Apostle John.The similarities of the crucifixion with the process of the red heifer sacrifice was educational.He addresses the four miraculous signs in Jewish history regarding the Temple from A.D.30-A.D.70.Mr.Martin shares some of Eusebius' writings about where Messiah lived and taught for the most part. This area became very important to Christians of the era before Constantine.There is so much information in this book!For years we have been taught incorrectly about the manner and location of Messiah's crucifixion. Reading this book has made me aware of more prophetic and symbolic meanings and the horrendous suffering by Messiah. The suffering goes beyond what you saw in "Passion of the Christ".I highly recommend this book.

Mr. Butz states in this book that James is one of the most over-looked figures in the history of the church.That is an accurate assessment in my view.James is very important as he was a brother of Jesus, and even a casual reading of Acts 15:13-21 alludes to the fact that he was respected by Peter and Paul in particular.They respected James enough that he settled the dispute that is the subject of that chapter.One of the subjects that the author deals with in detail is the family of Jesus.Mark 6:1-3 lists four brothers by name and sisters "here among us".He also takes the position that Jesus' family was not opposed to his mission.He's in good company in that Richard Bauckham shares that view.Another idea that is seldom explored is whether or not there were conflicts in early church history.Human logic suggests that there probably were disagreements.(If you think that "religion" is always peaceful and non-confrontational read Foxe's "Book of Martyrs".)The theory that James was more or less a "Bishop of the Jerusalem Church" makes sense.I see Peter as a missionary, not a Bishop or head of the church.Mr.Butz references such early church historians as;Eusebius,Clement,Hegesippus,and Josephus.He also looks at early church-age writings like gnostic writings and those that were used in early churches.While these books are not canonised they provide valuable insight into what early believers thought or believed.Some are way out there and others parallel Scripture very closely.The death of James is controversial.The author gives a few different versions of how he was martyred.If James did reside in Jerusalem after the Crucifixion and until his death that leads to the question..why?I believe that he was the leader of the early church and maybe even a Pharisee also.He was jewish that is certain.The concept of "jewish christians" is a step forward in understanding the early history of the church and it's relationship to judaism.One caveat about the book though...I am not at all convinced that Paul preached that grace replaced the law.It's more likely that greek words have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used.Did Paul and Peter have disagreements(or any of the Apostles for that matter)? Sure they did.I'm just not convinced that the subject matter is correct.At any rate, if you are looking for a well-researched,open minded book about James or the beginnings of the church,this is a book worth reading.I recommend it.

I read this book after reading and being favorably impressed with Dan Moldea's book "The Hoffa Wars".This book is a result of Moldea's lengthy investigation and the research of many individuals."The Killing of Robert F. Kennedy" is composed of three sections.Part 1 concerns the official police investigation. Part 2 explains the controversy arising from the official probe. Part 3 is Mr. Moldea's own investigation.He interviewed Sirhan Sirhan and Thane Cesar many times.The most troubling aspect of the Robert Kennedy murder investigation was that the controversy was self inflicted.The crime scene wasn't properly secured, the disposal of possible evidence, the controversy surrounding DeWayne Wolfer, and numerous "clerical errors" in related documents are just some of the factors that helped fuel conspiracy theories.Were there bullet holes in the center divider of the pantry? That's a question which a second gunman theory hinges on and Mr.Moldea hasn't convinced me that they weren't there.The girl with the polka-dot dress is another theme that was addressed.I do agree that the conclusion that he arrived at with the aid of Thomas Noguchi is correct. Especially after reading "Whoever Fights Monsters" by Robert Ressler ,his interviews with Sirhan Sirhan seem to confirm Moldea's theory.This is a good book and it reads like a novel with different twists and turns in the investigation.

This is a remaster of an older album released somewhere around 1992.This version includes the five bonus tracks one of which is an extended version.Another bonus is the contributions from Albert Collins on "The Blues Is Alright" and B.B. King on "Since I Met You Baby."So a few blues legends stopped by "after hours" to jam. How cool is that?Here are a few quick impressions on some of the songs that I like the most on "After Hours":"Cold Day In Hell" is the leadoff track and it sets the pace for a very good cd.Gary Moore added a horn section,a piano, and backgound singers to accent his blistering lead guitar on this track. The vocals make this seem like it should be his "signature" song."Since I Met You Baby" stands out for the guitar playing style and vocals shared by Moore and B.B. King. The quip from B.B King at the end of the song ("You Tell em' Gary") gives a glimpse into the working relationship between the two. This is a terrific song and one of the best that Gary Moore did in my opinion. There a few You Tube videos with these two performing together and the comraderie was evident and even entertaining."Only Fool In Town" tears it up right out of the gate. It's more of a hard rock inspired blues tune. The lead licks are screamers! There is a horn section backing it up and the vocals are great! "There's something about that woman." "You can take it from me, you're not the only fool in town.""Jumpin' At Shadows" is another well-done slow ballad that Gary Moore seemed to perform on every blues cd that I have listened to. The choice of notes and when to use them makes this a beautiful song! This is what I would call a "blues ballad". Penned by Duster Moore and performed Gary Moore style."The Blues Is Alright" is a Milton Campbell penned song notable for its slow subtle start that explodes into a blues lead that screams for attention. An added treat is the dual guitar of Gary Moore and Albert Collins. Some fantastic blues guitar can be heard on this song!"All Time Low" is an extended version song. Some of these extended versions get to be too long. Like a guest that won't take the hint and leave. This particular track is an exception! I'm left thinking it ended too soon. The backbeat is basic and repetitive but it sets up one of Gary Moore's best blues lead guitar performances. So good that I hit the rewind button enough to worry about wearing this track out. He covers a lot of stylistic ground from an almost crying sound to fast spanish style licks.The last track is "Once In A Blue Mood", an instrumental.One minor complaint that I have is that this song starts out very faint or low. Maybe it was planned and recorded that way for some reason. Not a big deal.The bass is like a jazz bass line and there is a piano accompanying it.What stands out front and center is the lead guitar and the tasteful placement of those notes.I'm not crazy about instrumentals in general, but this one rates very high in my eyes and ears.I noticed that two songs were misspelled in the track listings. They were identified correctly by title on the lyrics pages. The songs are "The Blues Is Alright" and "Once In A Blue Mood."If you listen to enough songs from an artist as versatile as Gary Moore you will find some high quality tunes that just aren't your style or taste. "Separate Ways", "The Hurt Inside" and "Nothing's The Same" are those songs for me.I would rate this cd at 4 stars if not for the bonus tracks.Bad for You Babyis a cd that I prefer slightly better than this cd.

This autobiography of T. Boone Pickens drew my interest partly because of the recent publicity of Mr. Pickens with his energy plan.This book is very readable and entertaining. Mr. Pickens comes across as a common country boy rather than an extremely wealthy oilman/financier.Part of his success appears to be rooted in his using new ideas and procedures that are now commonly known and used.I have read a few other books that touched on the Business Roundtable, Mr. Pickens has a scathing view of that organization.He explains that the energy "crisis" of 1979 was manipulated by withholding supply rather than an actual shortage.The author also elaborates on some of the corporate take-overs he was involved in. That offers an insider view that shares not only the part he and his company played but also the affected CEOs as well as the outside counsel and investment bankers.He also shares some of his business philosophy.Some of the quotes that I enjoyed the most were these;"Looking back, it seems as though I have spent my whole life raising money for a deal. One thing that you learn fast; you may not find money, but you're sure to meet some interesting people.""A CEO shouldn't leave until quitting time, just like everybody else. If he makes the biggest bucks, he ought to put in the longest hours.""The biggest hurdle in American corporations is the CEO's ego. Nowadays we talk about restructuring and "downsizing" companies, but what we really need is a way to downsize the egos."This may be a 22 year old book, but it was an enjoyable read and Pickens shares some common sense and wisdom throughout the book that applies to today.

This book was an eye-opener for me.The authors really give a lot of information about the different forces encountered in spiritual warfare.The experiences of missionaries abroad with territorial spirits is one example.Possession and exorcism are touched upon.The origins of demons was quite interesting and 3 Scripture-based theories are listed:1-"Disembodied spirits of inhabitants of the pre-Adamic Age."2-"The offspring of angels and antedeluvian women."3-"Fallen angels."The layout of "Wrestling with Dark Angels" is simple.There is a response to each chapter.The power evangelism topic wasn't interesting to me.The value of this book is in spiritual warfare and understanding how the enemy works.This book covers that area well!

From the Preface of his book Kevin Philips says-"My original ambition was to identify and explain the Bush-related transformation of the U.S.presidency into an increasingly dynastic office,a change with profound consequences for the American Republic,given the factors of family bias,domestic special interests,and foreign grudges that the Bushes,father and son,brought into the White House."Mr.Philips fulfills that ambition in this book.He delves into the family history and alliances,from Yale to Skull and Bones and in some cases to the O.S.S. and eventually the C.I.A.He explains "Texanomics" quite well. A kind of low-tax,low-service,high economic stratification brand of Southern economic conservatism.G.W.Bush's allegiance to big business and the astronomical tax rebates to companies like G.E. and the ever famous Enron are detailed in the book. Also discussed in the book are G.W.Bush's ties to Ken Lay and his lobbying for energy deregulation. I didn't know that Enron had been a large supporter of the Republican team in the Florida recounts of the 2000 presidential election."George W. Bush is in a class by himself when it comes to prevarication. It is no exaggeration to say that lying has become Bush's signature as president."- The American Prospect quoted in the book.Mr.Philips tells how the Bush-Cheney pairing in the White House is historical in that it brought two former energy company executives together.The author gives a clear description of what the military-industrial complex is and it's history.He details the major part petroleum has played in past as well as present wars. It's historical significance in the outcome of World War II can't be argued.This book explores the religious aspect of the junor president Bush and his relationship with evangelical voters in contrast with his father's relationship to the same group of voters.This is a very detailed book about the Bush and Walker families and the businesses they were involved in as well as the transformation of both president Bushes from business to their eventual presidencies.

John Coston has written a rapid-paced true crime thriller about Wayne Nance who killed mostly women and girls for 12 years.The actual number of victims is not known.His childhood was a disturbing one with Nance frequently getting into trouble and in one instance showing a cruel streak directed at some kittens. He also had an acute interest in the occult and sacrificed animals. Nance was definitely a loosely-wrapped head case when he started murdering as a teenager. What made him so dangerous was his ability to earn peoples' trust and come across as almost normal while hiding the fact that he was "a mercurial,seething psycho".Like a lot of serial killers you read about, Wayne Nance made mistakes and kept a few trophies. He avoided detection in small part by the tunnel vision of the sheriff in one of the cases. What's frustrating about the case was the fact that one of the investigators early on suspected him but couldn't get enough evidence. Things were a lot harder before DNA became a tool for law enforcement and Nance was very lucky.He was also an anomaly among serial killers, prowling a very small area and avoiding detection for more than a decade."To Kill and Kill Again" is a riveting true crime book. Among the best at telling the story not only of the killer and his victims,but also the heroic survivor who ended the killing spree.

This book is good for reading about Yahushua's Torah observance. The fact that Messiah attended and taught in the Temple validates the idea that He followed Torah. A quote in the book sums it up well "Both Jewish and Christian scholars clearly see that Yeshua followed the Torah." The author highlights some Scripture that can be easily over-looked. Some examples are found in Acts 22:12,21:20. "zealous for Law" and "devout man according to the Law" are two phrases that bear a close look. "Law" or "the law" in the NT is usually another name for Torah. These two passages make it clear that there were Messianic believers that still followed Torah!Mr Friedman wrote a fascinating section about the "early Church fathers" and their knowledge of the existence of Messianic Jews that followed Torah in the 1st century.He also wrote a very good chapter about Paul's actions and writing style.He could have gone further with some of his arguments. An interesting caveat regarding the Jersualem Concils' decision about the conditions for the believers at Antioch;Acts 15:21"for since ancient times,Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him and he is read in the synagogue every Sabbath day." Reading Chapter 15, it could be argued that the motive for following the conditions was to gain access to the synagogue for the purpose of being exposed to Torah(Laws of Moses).According to Matthew 5:17-18 Torah is still valid.This book is a good starting point for anyone that wants to study what the Messiah and his early followers thought and taught regarding Torah.

James Bovard chronicles the evolution of American presidential politics to the state we suffer today. Executive power has eroded individual liberties. He examines the low bar for what passes as truth from governmental leaders to the gullible citizenry."Attention Deficit Democracy" is loaded with quotes from historical figures.Like the quote on page 164 from Vin Weber- "We create the government that screws you, and then you're supposed to thank us for protecting you from it."The presidents and other leaders lie and we act like it's to be expected. Terms like "political illiteracy", "blind trust" and "mass ignorance" all too often seem to fit the general voting public.The chapter entitled "Messianic Democracy" was a brilliantly written history lesson on American foreign policy. A few examples were the CIA's aid in the military coup in Honduras of 1954 fueled by the interest of United Fruit Company in a dispute over compensation for land.A more recent example is the extreme U.S. manipulation of the Iraqi elections.Mr. Bovard examines the heavy influence of Leo Strauss' views on foreign policy via neo-conservatives. An enlightening quote from Shadia Drury's book notes that Strauss believed that "those who are fit to rule are those who realize that there is no morality and that there is only one natural right- the right of the superior to rule over the inferior." That's on page 96. That school of thought propelled the aggressive U.S. foreign policy position of preemptive war/invasion.The author hit the nail on the head regarding 9/11. "The fact that numerous government agencies botched their duty to defend the American people became, in Bush's eyes, a failure of freedom itself." Page 236."Attention Deficit Democracy" drives home the uncomfortable reality that a lot of us (citizens) don't care about truth in politics or power grabs by the administration past and present. This is due in part because we suffer from blind trust, reduced expectations, or ignorance. Any deficit in attention by the voting public is subject to exploitation by political campaigns.This is a very good book about current politics and how we as citizens need to be more attentive and return to the watchful attitude of the early Republic.

We bought the Bissell Momentum vacuum cleaner as a replacement for an older Dirt Devil bagless upright unit.I noticed an improvement in what was cleaned from the carpet. This new Bissell Momentum picks up more dirt and pet hair.Assembly was simple,all I needed was a screw driver.The Momentum is lighter than the Dirt Devil and has as much power.The height adjustment works and even does bare floors well.It came with a long cord. I have used the motorized attachment to vacuum chair pads and it didn't bog down, it worked well for me. The dirt canister is also easy to take off and locks in place easily when putting it back on.I have noticed that the replacement parts such as belts and HEPA filter are reasonably priced and readily available at a number of outlets. The washable filters are convenient also.I haven't been disappointed with the Bissell Momentum to date, we got it cheaper and I recommend this model with no reservations.

This is the true story of Robert Hansen,the worst serial killer in Alaska's history.He was a baker,amateur pilot,and avid hunter that preyed on prostitutes.He benefitted from his choice of victims. Prostitutes and dancers passed in and out of Alaska lured by the prospect of easy money servicing workers on the pipeline. And the local police didn't view them as credible witnesses. However,the FBI profilers had an accurate profile of Hansen in this case.Coincidentally,Hansen was a contemporary of the infamous Green River killer who was similar in stature and also preyed on hookers.The authors do an excellent job in writing from the view of the lead investigator who refused to quit despite the grueling process of putting together an air-tight case for the D.A.Hansen eventually confessed to killing over a dozen prostitutes but never admitted killing other women that weren't in that profession. In his own words-"I can't see anything in it for me,what's done is done. It's behind me now." A callous reponse to a request to cooperate in possibly solving more murders that he probably committed. The man has no remorse whatsoever.After reading of the evidence he had stashed in his home you will probably come to the same conclusion. He killed more women than he will ever admit to.A very well written true crime book. The authors managed to keep my attention focused even with the details of the trial,which can get boring.

This is an interesting compilation of apocryphal books.Every book has a short,but helpful Introduction.There are a handful of books that stand out from the rest for me.The General Epistle of Barnabas."This Epistle lays a greater claim to canonical authority than most others."May be the best book included.The Gospel of Nicodemus.Formerly called the "Acts of Pontius Pilate",this book is believed a forgery.It is an entertaining read about Christ's trial,crucifixion and some of the events surrounding it.The Shepherd of Hermas.The origin of this book is known. It has wisdom and is a useful book.The Secrets of Enoch is included in this book.This is the Slavonic version which I would rate lower than the Ethiopic version.This collection runs the gamut.You will find gnostic writings,legitimate early church age writings,and bizarre fiction.If you are interested in literature from that age or gnosticism,this book will be of more value to you.

This book is an excellent tool for anyone wanting to study Zechariah.David Baron was born in Russia and raised in a Jewish family.He latered converted to Christianity.This author's background enabled him to look at Zechariah from a number of view-points.What makes this book so good is that he mentions differing views from a number of sages and higher critics,than details the faults or accuracies in whatever theory.Zechariah prophesied of our Messiah and he gives Scripture reference to other O.T prophecies that tie together.The author also did an excellent job of showing how Zechariah relates to the book of Revelation.Mr.Baron does a superb job of explaining the book of Zechariah while making it an easy read.The footnotes are very informative.Also included in this book are a General Index and Scripture Index which make this a great reference book.

"Hostile Takeover" serves as more than just a book documenting how Corporate America has bought our government, it's also a guidebook the reader can use to debunk a number of lies, myths, and half-truths deployed in the effort to justify government policies that rip us off.Some of the topics that Mr. Sirota addresses are:$ How Oil companies manipulate gas and oil prices.$ Why the author believes the flat tax is a bad idea.$ The Welch business objective.$ How taxpayers' money pays to export jobs.$ Where employee pension money often ends up.$ The subject of HMO & health insurance company profits vs. health care for all citizens.$ Why "free" trade is only free for corporations.$ The Bush tax cuts for the wealthy policy.On wages and the gulf between the rich and the working class he says this; " The lower the wages, the less overhead for businesses, the bigger the salaries for executives, the more campaign contributions for politicians, and the most lies that are created to justify policies that persecute America's working families."The sheer volume of money and perks utilized by Corporate America through their lobbyists are mind-boggling! Free use of corporate jets and lobbyists that write bills are a few perks.The hypocrisy of Washington,D.C. is highlighted by some of the lies and scare tactics used on topics like health care and imported pharmaceuticals. Health care reform would lead to "rationed" health care, or "government-run" health care. As David Sirota points out, we basically have that already. After politicians are covered and the health care and insurance industry are finished gouging, isn't a form of "rationed" health care what we are left with? Regarding "government-run" health care, that seems to work well for Bush, Cheney and all of the Congressmembers that use it.Bush and others caution that Canadian pharmaceuticals could be "unsafe", yet noone can prove that these drugs are anything but safe, and equally important, they are cheaper! Importing Canadian pharmaceuticals would cut into somebody's profit margin.An internal Chevron memo from 1995 was leaked and the author quotes it to explain one part of manipulating gas prices. "If the U.S. petroleum industry doesn't reduce it's refining capacity,it will never see any substantial increase in refinery profits.""Hostile Takeover" is littered with notes and it documents the multitude of ways that Corporate America dictates the government's agenda through campaign contributions to both parties. There are "Heroes" and "Hacks" segments scattered throughout the book that offer a brief overview of individuals and why they fit that category.David Sirota includes a lot of detail in his complaints and offers solutions. I don't agree 100% with his solutions or viewpoints, but I recommend this book to any citizen concerned with our current government or suspicious of why things just don't seem right.

Kenneth McDuff is probably the only murderer to be sentenced to death twice...in two decades! It cost at least four women their lives when McDuff was paroled in 1989.Learn the harrowing tale of how a serial killer was released after his death sentence was commuted and later he was paroled.He wasn't charged with his first known rape and murder of a teen girl due to sloppy prosecution and faulty paperwork.He routinely violated his parole and probation conditions,sometimes within mere minutes after appearing in court! Mr. Lavergne aptly states that McDuff had "no moral compass." He wasn't an intelligent individual,he was aided by luck and mysterious assistance in leaving Texas after his murders. His neurotic mother regularly enabled him with financial support throughout his life.There a few mysteries left unexplained, the chief being the identity of the CI that coaxed McDuff into helping to locate the burial sites of his victims while on death row.Gary Lavergne has done his research and written in detail the chilling actions of a serial killer that got to continue killing long after he should have been executed.

What I like about this book is that it's easy.The reader is shown how to write Hebrew letters as well as the sounds associated with it.The authors explain the differences between Hebrew and English.They suggest using flash-cards or a similar memory tool. I am approaching memorization by writing the letters and the associated English sound and frequently referring to those papers.I recommend "Teach Yourself to Read Hebrew" as a basic starter book.

"Crypt 33" follows the life of Marilyn Monroe in chronological order from her birth as Norma Jeane Mortensen to her mysterious death. In between the authors document the loves,friendships,sycophants,successes and challenges in her life. She was nothing if not complex. One tidbit that I found interesting was her mother's poor health related in a large way to her job and the toxic fumes inhaled while cutting and splicing film at major studios.Of her marriages, Joe DiMaggio seemed to truly be her equal.The authors detail Marilyn's introduction to John Kennedy through Frank Sinatra."Crypt 33" contains a lot of information about JFK,RFK,Sam Giancana,Johnny Roselli and their ties. They shared more than just women.I found it quite interesting that Frank Hronek from the District Attorney's office monitored the Kennedys since August,1960. He freely admitted his belief that Marilyn Monroe was murdered. He wasn't the only person "monitoring" Marilyn Monroe's house, Bernard Spindel did that for Jimmy Hoffa. It's very likely that at one time there were Kennedy-Monroe audio tapes of their conversations and activities. Maybe there was a tape of her murder also.The "Cyanosis" chapter was revealing. The mishandling of her autopsy was a telling signal and a more experienced Dr. Noguchi stated later that she probably was murdered. I think that Adela Gregory and Milo Speriglio have the cause of death and all of the participants correctly identified.In a nutshell, I think they have solved the murder of Marilyn Monroe.

"Whoever Fights Monsters" by Robert Ressler can be summed up with a quote from page 125."Every ounce of information we can extract from a killer about his mind and methods gives us more ammunition to track the next one."Mr. Ressler chronicles his career with the military and eventually the FBI.He is credited with coining the term "serial killer" and he gives the meaning and origin of the term.In the book the author documents the start of profiling and his unsanctioned venture into prison interviews with violent criminals.It was risky, but over time has paid off with some candid interviews and useful information for future investigations.Some of the interview highlights that Mr. Ressler shares in the book come from Edmund Kemper, Charles Manson, Tex Watson, Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, and Richard Speck.He also gives examples of agent-interviewers who got too close emotionally to their subject.He wrote about the compulsive confessor Henry Lee Lucas who never saw a murder that he wouldn't claim as his work much to the embarrassment of law enforcement agencies throughout the country.Mr. Ressler's personal view of "Silence of the Lambs" and "Red Dragon" from his experience in the field was educational.I was impressed with this author's writing style. Profilers have a reputation for being arrogant (whether that's just an impression or valid I wouldn't know) but Mr. Ressler humbly explains mistakes he has made over his career. He is efficient at detailing the psychology of the different types of violent criminals. A good book about criminal profiling!

Celebrating the Feasts with family is a noble endeavor.I feel that this book has merit on that idea alone.However,celebrating Sunday as a weekly Sabbath is incorrect.The Sabbath from a Scriptural standpoint has always been the Seventh Day.The passage that the author uses does not reveal the day of Christ's resurrection.I noticed that Mrs. Zimmerman used the NASB for most of her Scripture quotes.She also used the New Berkely Version.A lot of authors use the NIV.Mrs. Zimmerman is to be commended for her choice of Bibles used.

This is the first edition of The Wealth Inequality Reader. The topics and their treatment are very relevant yet today.I personally prefer this book over "Top Heavy". This book does cite data from Edward Wolff but I found The Wealth Inequality Reader as an easier read.The book examines the 7 causes of wealth inequality.Contrasts income vs. wealth.What conservatives real motivation is for cutting taxes on the wealth- to eliminate social programs because they are too expensive. Chuck Collins shares his observation on the success of conservatives through think-tanks and similar organizations to push for policies that are not in the best interests of the vast majority of citizens.Page 88 has a quote from Kevin Phillips that I found to be still accurate in today's political landscape."When money is king, politicians get bought on a truly grand scale and philosophy bows to avarice."Chuck Collins and Dedrick Muhammad describe the neo-conservative "shrink, shift and shaft" agenda. Shrink regulation and welfare while enlarging "warfare" and "watchtower" states. Shift progressive taxes to regressive payroll taxes. Shaft the majority of the population by shafting(underfunding) infrastructure like schools and roads.A really intriguing subject is the Alaska Permanent Fund-an example of a public trust.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a critical study of current economic policies and some solid solutions from the Progressive side.

FOR THE PEOPLE is not a typical book about the U.S. Constitution in that it doesn't totally adopt either a liberal or a conservative viewpoint.The authors write in the introduction that the scheme of the Constitution is actually more populist than libertarian. They examine the Constitution as a tapestry rather than individual portions.The authors argue citizens have sovereignty, not government when addressing the topic of "sovereign immunity."The main point of this book is that the Constitution belongs to the citizens and that there are some facets of that document that you don't often read about.On page 7 they write " All exercise of authority must derive from us."One of the more intriguing subjects relates to amending the Constitution- the popular amendment to be specific. The authors make the case that a national referendum is a legitimate alternative.For an unfamiliar, thought-provoking book on Constitutional rights, responsibilities, and it's history I recommend FOR THE PEOPLE.

The central question posed by William Hartung is this-Are we as a democracy prepared to deal with the threat implied by the dangerous gathering of corporate,military,and governmental power in a small circle or group?"Why didn't we realize that George W. Bush was a radical,right-wing,neo-conservative 'wolf' dressed up in compassionate conservative 'sheep's' clothing?" is a question on page 4 that I have found myself pondering. I call it voter's remorse.Some issues that the author addresses quite well in the book are:-The identity of the "Vulcans", what their task was, areas of experience, how they got their nickname, and who chose and assembled them.-The farcical process by which Cheney basically selected himself as vice president.-The delusional exaggerations that have been Rumsfeld's trademarks throughout his career and his ties to various companies as an expensive lobbyist.-Rumsfeld's connection to Saddam Hussein in the 80's and his "nuclear" connections with North Korea.-The Carlyle Group and it's infamous crony connections.-The many fiascoes of John Bolton.-How think tanks are biased by means of financial support.-The neoconservative think tanks membership and how they set policies in Dubya's administration.-The identity of the warhawks that schemed up the policy of "preventive war".-The abuse of his position as Chairman of the Defense Policy Board by Richard Perle in solicting funds for his company-Trireme. Which coincidentally, was incorporated in November of 2001 in time to benefit from the foreseen military/security spending boom.Mr. Hartung references a Seymour Hersh report of Perle's unethical pursuit of funding.He quotes Paul Krugman on Bush's policy-"leave no defense contractor behind".The author has Chapter notes at the end of each chapter which cite sources."How Much Are You Making on the War Daddy?" is an excellent expose' on the profiteers of the current wars and the people that actually make the policies of the current president.

I bought the Kodak Easy Share CX 6230 new at a big-box retail store eight years ago.As part of the purchase I bought a Kodak 64 MB SD memory card which was a great investment!I bought a cheap, generic digital camera new before purchasing this camera. The Kodak was definitely an upgrade and for slightly less money! So the price was reasonable.This camera has worked well for me throughout the years and it is a dependable camera for what it is.What it is- it's a simple point-and-shoot camera. There are not a lot of fine-tune adjustments.Never tried the video feature but the other settings on the control knob work well-Automatic,Landscape,and Close-up worked well enough to suit me.This camera would be great for teens. It's a no-fuss unit.Pictures in a dark setting are not a strength for this camera. Photos using the zoom on maximum can look a bit blurry,especially around the edges.Another minor annoyance is that the ok button to the left of the viewing window on the back is way too "touchy".By that, I mean that if you don't push the button exactly in the center it will not confirm what you are doing whether deleting pictures,setting the date ec...It eats batteries like any digital camera. We tried lithium batteries and found that they lasted longer, but I'm not sure that they last long enough to justify the added expense. Rechargeable batteries would be a better solution in my opinion.For durability: This camera has lasted a long time with no problems. It's never been dropped or abused(batteries left in,exposed to weather etc..) either though.For everyday snapshots and durability this camera is a solid choice. Not a bad choice for a beginner.It has proven to be an excellent investment for what I needed at the time!

This book is the product of over 30 years of research.It is heavily illustrated,which is helpful."When a society goes down...[or]a society perishes,one condition may always be found.They forgot where they came from."-from the Introduction.The camp arrangements of the Twelve Tribes are diagrammed.Both primary emblems and secondary emblems of the tribes are also illustrated.Mr.Bennett also uses Scripture in exploring the emblems for tribal identification.The Brigade emblems are found in visions by John(Rev.4:7)and Ezekiel(1:5-10).A Chapter is devoted to the Coronation Stone/Jacob's Pillar in Britain.The copy reviewed here is a 210 page,hard cover published in 1985.This is one of the better books available on the subject of the Lost Tribes.

In this book Chritopher Ruddy provides many facts about the strange death of Vincent Foster. That death is historically significant whether it was suicide or homicide,after all it's not often that someone close to a sitting president succombs to a mysterious death. Mr. Ruddy shares information from discussions with homicide detectives,medical examiners,and staff from the Starr investigations.Here are some issues that the author touches on:The gun supposedly found in Vincent Foster's hand. It was a 1913 Colt that was basically a cobbled-up "drop piece" made from combining two guns with two differing serial numbers. Most disturbing is the fact that it wasn't his gun. Add to that witness statements that claimed the gun was a different color and was a semi-automatic rather than a revolver. A lot of conflicting witness statements about something as important as the gun used in a potential suicide.The different locations of the body. Mr.Ruddy clearly and logically explains where the corpse was discovered by those first on the scene.The "crime scene" was not the place of Mr.Foster's death. The body was moved,that much is very obvious from the blood evidence! Unless of course blood can run uphill.The problematic location of his glasses and the presence of gunpowder on them.There were conflicting reports regarding Foster's briefcase,and it's likely location in the Honda car at the park.The timeline within the White House and how soon they really knew about the death. The strange Secret Service memo that stated "Vince Foster shot himself in the White House parking lot". Helen Dickey repeated that before recanting later.The search and subsequent destruction of documents from Foster's White House office. Another mystery surrounding the case.The way that White House personnel obstructed or adversely affected investigations into the death. The long-standing relationships with investigators and the poor choice of some of the participants such as Fiske and Starr.The possible motivation for having the Park Police investigate the case is explained by their less than illustrious history with crimes and coverups.While this book doesn't prove a homicide or suicide,it does prove an obvious coverup. The body was definitely moved. Did Vincent Foster committ suicide in a White House parking lot? We'll probably never know the truth about the location and cause of death.Christopher Ruddy has written an excellent book and I recommend it!

WAR POWERS by Peter Irons is a history book addressing the authority to declare war.It starts with the Continental Congress and the positions of various delegates regarding executive powers.Mr. Irons provides some pertinent quotes such as this from page 34-"In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war and peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department".-James Madison.An interesting aspect of his journey through presidential history is that some favorite presidents trespassed the Constitution on the issue of waging war and admitted doing so. Others like Wilson and Bush II viewed it far differently.Mr. Irons explains that over the course of American political history it wasn't only Congress abdicating it's Constitutional duty that was partially at fault. The Supreme Court during different eras deferred to the president or simply avoided the issue by labeling it a "political issue".He explains the correlation between corporate interests and the global network of military bases.The author quoted one phrase from Justice Davis' 1866 writing on the Milligan case that bears repeating in this review. It's even more important today that it was 140 + years ago."The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances." -Justice David Davis.As a book on imperial presidential ambitions and history, this book is unbiased.It's a little dated (2005) but worth reading for understanding how war powers have been taken over by the executive branch and how the other two branches of government have reacted.This book also examines how the executive branch has infringed on individual rights of citizens and non-citizens alike. One prime example he cites is the internment of Japanese-American citizens during WWII.

The illustrations in this book are excellent! Unfortunately,the print is ridiculously small.The author does cover a lot of basic information about Freemasonry; an interesting topic was the concept of time related to the building of various temples. Solomon's temple or the second temple constucted by Zerubbabel.The Masonic year began in March. In the past Hebrew names of months were used. There are a lot of Hebrew connections to Freemasonry. Those connections relate to,among other areas,cabbala and also the Tree of Life.Speculative masonry rejected the legend of the craft which honored the tower of Babel and Nimrod for a preferred link to King Solomon.There is a legend telling of how 3 architects discovered an ancient temple attributed to Enoch and the discovery of "a brilliantly shining triangle". I had not formerly heard of an Enochian temple.The last descendant of Cain was Tubal-Cain-a blacksmith. Biblically speaking,Cain was a builder and built a city. I don't see a Scripture that claims that Cain "founded a dynasty of creators". But that doesn't make it fiction.Hiram the architect was a son of a widow. There is a tie with Horus,also the son of a widow.There was a fascinating chapter about the Two Pillars and possible identifications to different mythological or Biblical figures.The subject of the "forbidden fruit" of Genesis was something new. Could it have been a fig or a pomegranate instead of an apple? The argument that they are more common to the Jerusalem area makes sense. Something to ponder anyway."Khor" is the Hebrew form of "Horus" the Egyptian god. That looks very much like the "Kore" of the Old Testsament.A list of Masons in history was a trivia bonus.Despite the small print,this book is an educational tool for anyone interesting in taking an outsider's curious look at Freemasonry.The author details different rites of Masonry and where they originated. He really covers a lot of ground despite the small size of the book.

LEGAL RESEARCH, ANALYSIS, AND WRITING provides everything you need to learn in order to successfully research and analyze law."How to write a Case Brief" gives instructions on how to write one of the most important documents in the legal field.One of the fundamentals that the authors stress in the book is preparation. Preparation can cut down on costs and make the research process shorter and more effective.Case Projects and Research Assignments and Activities are essential exercises to educate the reader.Some other features that are particularly helpful for me:*The Figures showing pages from codebooks, websites, and books for research. This shows the reader what theses sources look like. The page layout, diagrams, and labels break down each figure making it easier to navigate the source in the pictures.* A Point to Remember are assorted, helpful tips scattered throughout the book.*Appendix B - a basic Citation Reference Guide. Also references to citation rules from The Bluebook.This book provides very detailed information about citing cases, analyzing legal issues, and research using both on-line and print resources.Legal writing is addressed with suggestions on how to start the writing process, the difference in types of documents and how they differ in style or content.Two words that sum up this edition for me are Detailed and Professional. I'm keeping my copy so that I can refer back to it when I need to.

In the Introduction of "The Aramaic Peshitta New Testament Translation" Janet Magiera details her objective for this book.That objective is to promote further understanding of the message of the New Testament through understanding the language of Jesus, it's idioms, and figures of speech.I think that she succeeded for the most part.This translation is refreshing and makes many passages more clear. She uses the generic titles(God and Lord) and the name Jesus Christ instead of the Aramaic or Hebrew names. I understand that this translation is viewing Christians as the prospective audience.She provides an educational brief history of the Aramaic language.The Idiom chart has four columns: English-Aramaic-literal translation-Scripture example.The differences in the Eastern and Western Peshittas are described also. This translation includes the 27 New Testament books.Appendix 1 has Figures of Speech in five categories. Appendix 2 has money, weights, & Measures. There is also a Bibliography. The text has loads of footnotes. A great example is the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew 1.Some of the renderings of note:Matthew 6:13 has "and do not let us enter into trial" rather than "lead us not into temptation" which contradicts James 1:13.Rev.1:10 is one passage that may be questionable. The subject is the "Lord's day". The translator has it meaning a day of the week where it alternately can be the day of judgment. Was it referring to the event that John saw or the day that he saw it?I prefer this Peshitta New Testament Translation over Lamsa's. The charts and other additional information are both helpful and educational.

"The Rapture Plot" is a very detailed book written after extensive research by Dave MacPherson. He uses numerous writings from the late 1820's up to the date of this book(1994).There is no doubt that the pre-trib rapture hoax originated with Margaret MacDonald and was preached first by Edward Irving before Darby.The contortions of Scripture used throughout history to attempt to somehow authenticate pre-trib rapture are examined.Some of the phrases and the all too popular "symbolism" are also detailed.A few examples would be the notion that the "man-child" of Revelation 12:5 is the "mystical body of Christ"(Yahushua);the Church. Another extreme use of symbolism is the idea that when John was beckoned "come up hither" it was an invitation to the Church. MacPherson also wrote about the error that any prophecy that hadn't been fulfilled regarding Israel,Judah,Jerusalem,or Zion should be assigned in a figurative and spiritual sense to the Church.What Dave MacPherson does so well in "The Rapture Plot" is detail the written history of the pre-trib theory and the evolution of thought by some of the larger figures,especially John Darby and even some of today's writers.I highly recommend this book!!

In Dave Hunt's book he exposes who the woman is that rides the beast in Revelation.The identity ties in directly with the metamorphosis of the early "church".He is accurate when he states that Roman Catholicism has always been what Constantine (the Great sun worshipper) blended-early Christianity and paganism. Right down to the "Queen of Heaven" who was worshipped in pagan cults before the Catholic Church called her "Mary".His investigation into the source of the RCC's vast riches was quite interesting.Some factual food for thought a reader will glean from "A Woman Rides the Beast":"Peter whom the Catholics erroneously claim was the first pope was married". Page 77. See I Cor.9:5.Catholic writers claim "Babylon" means Rome. From Karl Keating;"Babylon is a code word for Rome". Page 68.Papal violation of I Peter 5:1-3. A shepherd of the flock is not to "lord" over the flock.Mr. Hunt gives some details of the papal involvement in the Inquisitions(See "Foxe's Book of Martyrs" for more detailed coverage of the subject)as well as the pope's concordats in the WWII period.The real motivation for infant baptism/sprinkling.This book is documented and a lot of the souces for quotes are from Catholic apologists!!!One topic that has far-reaching negative effects on the Catholic Church is celibacy. This all too often means not abstaining from sex, but rather refraining from marriage.The source of the problems with RCC (and I could argue other denominations as well)is summed up by the author very well on page 184. "Christians had not used images untill Constantine became the de-facto head of the church. The door that was opened to paganism at that time has never been shut. The church attempted to accomodate the pagans joining it by retaining their idols under Christian names"."When it's tradition and the Bible conflict,Rome goes by tradition."It's all about traditions of man and the church. Page 347.I personally believe that Dave Hunt has the woman from Revelation 17 & 18 identified accurately and in more ways than one. A fascinating read and I highly recommend it.

"Offshore" focuses on Cayman and it's major role in offshore finances.Mr. Brittain-Catlin does a good job of explaining how corporations are viewed on the island in relation to individual citizens. Transfer Pricing is also defined. The biggest lure to Cayman for businesses was to evade taxes in their home country.The author also examines Delaware as another popular base for multinational holding companies and subsidiaries.Their was a memorable quote from Willaim Greider on the subject of the S&L; bailout of the past- "The government's regulatory system was perversely diverted to a different purpose-'socializing' the losses accumulating by freewheeling bankers and developers by making every taxpayer pay for them." The same scenario as the Wall Street bailout of this year, bailout financial institutions with working peoples' taxes.The saving of LTCM is a similar story that the author brought up.One gem from the author was found on page 172 while discussing acclaimed "economic growth"."That economic growth had been brought about by letting corporations out of their obligation to pay taxes on their earnings. That growth was, in effect, their taxes, simply retained as profits and parked offshore."This book had some meaningful information as a result of research done by the author.What detracts from an otherwise very good book is the author's foray into mytholgy and related characters. It grew old for me personally.

This book is very helpful for learning about the NT church and it's leaders.It is a "chronological-sociological-historical synopsis of the entire NT." Frank Viola does an excellent job weaving the NT in chronological order.He gives the date,author,and purpose of the letters and books.The notes and Scripture in the End Notes are educational."Sharpening the Focus" is another very informational tool in this book.On the sociological side,Mr. Viola details the living conditions,health problems(eyesight for one),literacy rate,and average life-span of the citizens in some areas of the Roman Empire(Rome and Galatia for instance).Of all the aspects of this book,the chronology is the most helpful!He defines the two wings of Pharisaism very well.I didn't know that the order of the Pauline letters was determined by their length!Also of interest to me was the origin of the Gospel of Mark.The author does a great job in the definition of the members of the early church.In Antioch they were first called "Christians" by the Greeks.They actually called themselves "the Way".In Palestine they are called "Nazarenes".I listed a few tidbits of info that I found interesting.There is more in this book.Frank Viola did an excellent job with this book and succeeded in making the NT much more easy to understand.This book is very easy to read and beneficial to any collection or library.

This biography is as detailed about the legendary actor as it is large."Bogart" was started by Ann Sperber. After her death Eric Lax finished the book. Sperber interviewed over 200 people in her research ranging from family such as Lauren Bacall and son Stephen, to friends in Hollywood.Humphrey Bogart's childhood was detailed. His parents were successful as a doctor and an artist. They were also addicts that didn't spend a lot of time with their children.The authors followed Bogart's journey in acting, how it started and his long journey that ultimately led to stardom. His marriages were also detailed.The personal politics of the movie studios, especially Warner Bothers was examined. Bogie and Bacall's battles with the studio were discussed.Bogart's political views and his actions were detailed.This is a large book that includes an Index and a Filmography that any Bogart fan will appreciate.An excellent book about Humphrey Bogart- his childhood, the good and the bad experiences that his contemporaries shared.

I bought the Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary on the strength of a friend's recommendation.This dictionary is very comprehensive.It covers every word I have looked for.The charts and time-lines are an unexpected bonus.The binding is excellent.That's important when dealing with a large book.If you are looking for a Bible Dictionary that covers the most words and has the most information in general,this is probably the one!

I'm no fan of James Carville.I give him credit for his writing style and wit. The book is entertaining.Carville didn't address outsourcing which was a disappointment for me.The issues that he did address he did in a no-nonsense way. And he's correct about his complaints and observations.James Carville has some great ideas on taxes, MediCare, and Social Security.Another excellent solution was offered for campaign finance reform.On tax cuts for the rich he wrote this-"In my fifty eight years on this earth, the only thing tax cuts have worked to do is get people elected who don't have a single idea in their heads." Page 112.This book is outdated but serves well as a Progressive primer on issues that are just relevant today as when he wrote this book. It's a fast read and worth reading.

This book is a sniper's look at the assassination and the scene.Mr.Roberts theory of "crossfire" or "triangulation of fire" is excellent,especially considering his military experience.I think he may be correct about the location of the hit teams.Were the hit teams made up of a Corsican assassin and a member of ZR/Rifle? The author isn't the only writer that has offered that theory.Craig Roberts theory about what happened to the President's body aboard Air Force 1 is intriguing! His investigation into the aircraft and strange activity related to the flight was good also.What is debatable is the identity of those responsible for the murder.It seems most likely that the mafia was working with the CIA to committ the crime with J.Edgar Hoover working for the mafia to cover it up.This book is worth reading for the insight offered by the author considering his experience and knowledge.

The purpose of this book is to help us understand the idioms used in the Bible.Part One is broken down into books by order;Genesis first etc..A phrase and location are listed with a translation.An example-Gen.49:24 "His bow abode in strength" means he will become a valiant warrior.Some of the translations in this book are "off the mark" in my opinion.The number 666 meaning Nero Caesar.The Sons of God from Genesis 6 being Seth's descendants.These ideas are debatable.A Key to the original Gospels(Part Two of the book) has some interesting information."Eli,Eli,Lmana Sabachthani" the phrase uttered my Messiah shortly before his death is rendered-"My God,my God,for this I was kept."Mr.Lamsa may have went a bit too far looking for symbolic meaning in passages that have a literal meaning.While I don't think that this book is without error, it has value as a tool for studying some difficult idioms.

This is an excellent book on the subject of judaism in the period between the OT and the NT.Dr. Julius Scott covers a lot of ground regarding religious beliefs and how they changed over time.There were different branches of judaism with similarities as well as differences.The author also details some contrasts between Samaritans,Pharisees,and Sadducees.There is some helpful information on the Septuagint,it's source,and difference of translation between the hebrew OT and the greek OT.Dr.Scott looks at Josephus and Philo and the value of their writings in the study of intertestamental judaism,with some understandable scepticism of Josephus.He also details the priesthood and rivalry between families-Zadokites and Tobiads.The pollution of the priesthood is also discussed.He covers the start of rabbinical judaism and the circumstances that led to the percieved need for oral law/tradition as a hedge around Torah.There was some interesting information about Simon bar Kosiba(Kochba).There is an "Intertestamental Calendar and Festivals Table" that is an excellent resource about the Biblical feasts.This period also saw the addition and alteration of some OT feasts.The use of the sacred name is discussed."The Talmud and other rabbinical sources indicate that by the time of Simon the Just(c.200BC)the divine name was no longer pronounced,except by the high priest on Yom Kippur".He also had an interesting perspective on the sabbatical and Jubilee years."The sabbatical year,occuring every seventh year and the Jubilee,every fiftieth year,prevented the accumulation of too much wealth and oppression of the poor".There is a very good list of general sources,frequent footnotes and quotes.I found a few minor points that I think are debatable in the book.That doesn't lessen the value of the author's work.While not as comprehensive as Edersheim's "The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah", this book is a good choice for anyone interested in the diverse beliefs and Messianic expectations of the period.

I like Joe Conason's writing style. He's very direct and accurate when he rants about the worst president(Dubya) and the Republicans in general.He cites a wide variety of polls that show that a majority of citizens do not support Bush's tax cuts for the rich and prefer public spending. Just one example of right-wing misrepresentation of "polls" and "the peoples' will."As Mr. Conason writes-"Liberals defend the interests of working Americans against the fake populism of corporate conservatism."It's past time that Democrats own that and use it against the Republicans!An example of the hypocrisy on the right is the complaints about "Hollywood limousines" while the corporate jets "depart on schedule for those tax havens inn the Caribbean." It's projection away from the right wing flaw.He tackles the myth of a "liberal media bias" that most casual observers know doesn't exist. Fox News is one blatant example of why there is no "liberal bias." It's another straw man that conservatives bring out regularly.The author also wrote about the disturbing attacks on Tom Daschle by Karl Rove and James Dobson.On patriotism he lists a large number of conservative Republicans that dodged the draft during Viet Nam and later tried to paint liberals as weak on defense and patriotism. He uses Max Cleland as an example of a Democrat that was severely wounded while serving his country.Some quotes that I found especially witty and accurate were these:"The Republicans take from the poor, give to the rich, and get themselves re-elected." Page 85."It's the unfair burdens on the rich that always cause George W. Bush deep concern, a caring that seems strangely absent from his approach to the problems of the poor." Page 172.Another interesting subject was the connection of Jeb Bush to Orlando Bosch.If you want an author to debunk the myriad lies of the right wing spin machine, this book does that better than most.A dated but well-documented expose on right wing politics.

I really tried to like this book.As a populist I was expecting something better than what I read in this book.Are there some excellent profiles on American figures and their populist views?Yes. And some extremely good material like quotations from Senator Robert Taft, Thomas Jefferson, H.L.Mencken, and Senator Bob LaFollette to list just four of the many leaders cited.What ruined the book for me was the racist views aired over and over throughout this book!I give it one star and no recommendation.It's too bad because the title and subject held a lot of promise on a subject even more relevant today.

This is a reader type book which includes some articles from "The Nation" magazine. Some of the contributors that I like the best were William Greider,Bill Moyers, and Miles Rapoport.This book was published in 2004 prior to Bush's reelection so some of the material is now out-of-date.William Greider took a critical look at the conservative plans for taxation, basically tax labor instead of capital.Bush's "market friendly" health care reforms and how drug companies and HMO's benefited from it.Robert Reich had this to say about Bush's tax cuts. "Their purpose was to reward the administration's wealthy friends, and at the same time to starve the government so that there's no money left for Social Security, Medicare, education, health care, or anything else. Privatization of such services becomes a more palatable alternative when there's no money for public provision."Some of the obstacles in the way of universal health care are listed. Among them are the power of health insurance and big pharmaceutical company lobbyists.Also examined were the large portion of the health care tab that pays administrative fees and profit.Bracken Hendricks covered energy deregulation and the results of that strategy as well as Cheney's secret energy task force and how the energy plan didn't address the dependency on imported oil.Benjamin Barber provided the less-known second verse of "America the Beautiful". "America! America! God mend thine every flaw. Confirm thy soul in self control. Thy Liberty is law!" Self Control and Liberty are words that stand out.I didn't find any value in the "Declaration of Interdependence". It rings too much like a global or world order. No thanks. I'll stick with the "Declaration of Independence" and the Constitution.I really like some of the election reform ideas that Miles Rapoport contributed.Allowing sixteen and seventeen year old students to preregister to vote while in High School is one.Making Election Day a national holiday is another idea that might stimulate more voter participation.Bill Moyers gave some history comparing Karl Rove with Mark Hanna, the man that made William McKinley.This book has some well thought out ideas for fixing a lot of the damage that the Bush administration has caused.

The strength of this book is its quotes. Some humorous,some seriously arrogant,and some poignant.There was a chapter on Ari Fleischer and his evasive tactics that served Bush II so well during press conferences.One of the Republican whoppers that was dispelled was the fictional "Charley the janitor", an invention of Dick Armey, lately known as the wizard behind the curtain of the Tea Party.There was another interesting piece on the Republican press and how they spin tax cuts for the wealthy to the poor and the working poor.Then there is this quote from David Stockman on Reagan's 1981 tax bill-"[Supply-side economics] was always a trojan horse to bring down the top rate...Do you realize the greed that came to the forefront? The hogs were really feeding."There were some humorous mis-speak quotes from Dan Quayle that sound very similar to Bushisms made dubiously famous by Bush 41.You will find a collection of Bushisms here unrivaled by most books.Another interesting subject was the close ties between George W. Bush and Ken Lay.On page 393 there is a quote from Harry S. Truman-"Republicans are....bloodsuckers with offices in Wall Street, princes of privilege,plunderers."- Harry S. Truman,1948.Recent history suggests that Harry called that one correctly!This book is mostly rhetoric and poorly titled but there is some very good reading from authors such as Greg Palast, Senator Robert Byrd, Stanley Kutler, and The Onion. Greg Palast contributed some investigative reporting on election 2000. Very good information that you won't find in many American news sources.

This book is based on Peter Wallison's year in the White House when he served as a legal counsel.This book shares some of Ronald Reagan's wit,humor,and humility.Mr.Wallison offers an assessment of the media coverage regarding the Reagan administration. The media had a tendency to over-cover the sensational while ignoring subjects of substance,like policy(foreign or domestic).They trolled for scandals.This book shows what management style was used by the President.It also debuncts the myth that President Reagan was not intelligent.Another interesting topic in this book is the behind the scenes view of situations in the cabinet. Leaks to the media and how rampant they were from the White House and especially the Hill.There was a comparison of the Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Wallison wrote mostly about Donald Regan because he worked with him.The chapters dedicated to the Iran-Contra scandal were very good! I came away with a better understanding of exactly what happened and who was involved.This is the first book that I have read about President Reagan. I recommend it as a balanced book from an author who worked in the White House. I wish that he had been there longer!

This book is a collection of knowledge from doctors and herbal practicioners that provides the reader with information to help make informed decisions on whether to use medicine or herbal alternatives.This book is layed out well and is easy to navigate and use.There are profiles of herbal treatments including effectiveness, possible side effects, and typical dosage. There are the usual cautions also.The types of herbs are categorized."The Herbal Drugstore" also offers the following:Remedies by condition(ailment) listed with commonly used drugs and herbal alternatives.Tips on buying herbs, growing herbs, making your own herbal products.Exploring treatment options.The Herb Profiles section offers a close-up look at common herbs showing alternate names, source, part used, forms available, uses, and cautions.The Index at the end of the book is very helpful also.I recommend keeping "The Herbal Drugstore" on hand as a valuable, convenient herbal guide. I would rate it on par with "The Green Pharmarcy".

After reading this book and Mark Baxter's review I will add a few short comments.Mr. Baxter's review covered the book very well!One observation that I make on this book is the author's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald was a communist assassin of John F. Kennedy. That theory/cover story has not fared well over time.Another observation regards the CFR. Whatever they are, they are not as secret as they were in 1970. The CFR maintains its own public website nowadays.Mr. Clousen makes a lot of disturbing points regarding the establishment powers. Most of them will be recognized by any reader of conspiracy theory books. What's disturbing is the likely truth of those topics.One that comes to mind is the election of Woodrow Wilson and the reputed influence that Edward Mandell House exerted over that administration. Along that line, the book "Philip Dru: Adminstrator" has become a bit more available of late.The Benjamin Disraeli quote sums up the book nicely "The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes."That especailly applies today when considering politics and the almighty dollar.This is a classic in the conspiracy theory genre. It's also a well-written commentary on Quigley's book!

Richard Schickel is a friend of Clint Eastwood. That itself shouldn't disqualify him from writing this book.The problem with the book is that it is very biased, he spends an absurd portion of the book defending Eastwood from an assortment of negative movie critiques, predominantly those of Pauline Kael.I am a fan of most of Clint Eastwood's films and movie critics have never been a factor in formulating my opinion of any particular movie. And I don't see why Clint Eastwood's work needs defending!"Clint Eastwood-a Biography" is otherwise loaded with some fascinating facts about Eastwood's life and career.Schickel describes how Eastwood obtained various scripts for movies that he was involved in as an actor, director, and sometimes both.The details include his relationship with other stars, directors, and producers.Who proposed the forming of Malpaso and how monumental that company became is another topic in the book.I found it interesting that Clint turned down the part of "Harmonica" in "Once Upon a Time in the West". That's the role that Charles Bronson accepted in a movie that eventually came to be regarded as one of the best westerns of all time and a personal favorite of mine.The book details Eastwood's inherited musical talent and how deeply jazz has influenced the actor both musically and in film.Clint solves the mystery of the identity of his character in "High Plains Drifter".Another aspect of Eastwood as a director is the location of shoots for the "Eiger Sanction" and "Unforgiven". His sense of realism can be extreme, but admirable.Overall "Clint Eastwood-a Biography" has a lot of trivia-type information and can be entertaining. What downgrades the book considerably is the seemingly endless ranting about the negative reviews from movie critics.

This book exposes the hypocrisy of the Christian right.Their support of Israel is motivated by the belief that mortal men can accelerate Armageddon and the false expectation of a rapture.It seems disingenuous to me that a Christian leader could support the building of a third temple and a return to animal sacrifice.After all,was sacrificial law not fulfilled by the crucifixion of Yahushua(Christ)?These religious leaders don't really like Jews. They are just using them to get something that they want.A few quotes in the book show that very clearly-"Who will the Antichrist be?...Of course he'll be Jewish."-Jerry Falwell."Only 144,000 Jews will remain alive after Armageddon."-Hal Lindsey.That's not exactly a flattering endorsement! Errant also in that the passage used doesn't anywhere identify the 144,000 as Jews. A member of a tribe of Israel is not necessarily identical to a Jew or someone practicing Judaism.Some food for thought regarding Armageddon;Nobody can force God's(YaHUaH) hand!What will people do when the rapture doesn't happen?It's very easy to sell Christians on the idea of a "free pass" while the Jews are supposedly being "purged".After all,who wants to suffer?This book goes a long way in showing the real motivation of some Christian leaders' support of Israel.They really seem to believe that they can speed up the process of what God clearly controls!This is a well written,easy reading book.I recommend it.

The heart of the subject matter in this book is nationalism vs. free trade/globalism.Pat Buchanan's view on free trade is interesting considering that he himself formerly held a pro-free trade opinion.He communicates why he opposes free trade very well in this book.Mr. Bucahanan's detailing of the political battles over free trade vs.protectionism was enlightening.It was interesting to read about where some of the former Presidents and other leaders stood on the topic.It would seem that it boils down to a question of revenue sources.Income tax or tariffs on imports? If history is an accurate indicator,tariffs have carried the load well before the personal income tax was implemented.Something to consider in economics or anything in general:nothing is free.It all costs you at some point.While there is nothing wrong with importing or exporting goods,there should be a level playing field or a cost to enter into the American marketplace.The cost shouldn't be a loss of textile jobs for American workers so that we can have cheap T-shirts.I think "The Great Betrayal" is a well-written,easy to read book that makes the author's points effectively.It's written in the same vein as Lou Dobbs' "War on the Middle Class", only about 6 years earlier.The Dobbs book is another very good book!

The author has exposed some pagan traditions in the holidays that he addresses in this book.The American history of Easter celebration was interesting.The change from Passover celebration to Easter celebration was on point.He is correct also about King Saul and witchcraft(consulting a witch)and Solomon's connection to the worship of pagan gods.Mr.Ingraham does an excellent job of showing that Halloween is prohibited in Scripture.The section connecting Roman Emperors to Babylonian cults was also good.Christmas and it's origin as saturnalia prior to Jesus' mission was helpful.There are two points that I disagree with though:I think that his concept of the harlot in Rev.17 is only partially correct.The idea that Abraham may have worshipped pagan gods because of the meaning of his name is not correct according to the Holman Bible Dictionary.Abram simply means "Father is exalted" while Abraham means "Father of a multitude".While I think that the author is in error on a few minor points,this book does have some very good information about pagan traditions.Lew White's books and "Come out of her my People" by C.J Koster are books that I would recommend over this book.

This is a book that a reader will either find offensive or revealing.Regardless of that,it is well-written and documented.Mr.Koster gives detailed quotes in the book,like "the Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday,a day which we never sanctify."-Cardinal Gibbons in "Faith of our Fathers".The author wrote about some errors in certain Bible translations and that's something that has been known for some time. What may not be so well-known is the background of some of the "early church fathers". Fascinating information!I investigated a statement in this book with the Jersualem Bible.Rev 17:5 does indeed have a footnote regarding "Babylon the Great" in that passage."Babylon is the symbolic name for Rome" is the footnote.He quotes numerous Scripture pertaining to the Name of God.Mr.Koster also discusses the motive for claiming the resurrection occured on a Sunday. An upright stake being used in the crucifixion is something I have read about previously.An excellent book if you want study traditions in the light of Scripture and history!

FATAL HOUR has a lot of material about mostly the JFK assassination. Quite a bit of that material has been covered in other books that I have read.Mr. Blakey delves into elements of organized crime and their connections to the assassination. He makes a compelling case for the multiple strong ties of Cosa Nostra members and Jack Ruby. There were also connections to Oswald, although probably not as direct.This book strongly argues for the second shooter being placed on the Grassy Knoll. What I'm not convinced of is the direction of the fatal shot. The Zapruder film and physics point to a shot from the front. Oswald as an effective shooter hasn't been proven in my opinion.On the positive side, Blakey is to be commended for not relying on the Warren Commission Report and actually investigating evidence that indicated a second gunman.I favor the two books below over this book.But FATAL HOUR has some good points and is worthy of a read.ConspiracyUltimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK

Stephanie Stanley was a reporter for the Times-Picayune in New Orleans in 2002. She proves to be a talented true crime author with this book.There is a common theme with some serial killers-an abusive petty criminal breaks the law with impunity and recieves little or no punishment. As a child nothing is his fault. Derrick Todd Lee shares that theme with Kenneth McDuff.The investigations into the multiple murders that Lee committed were hampered by two factors. First,the usual routine of looking at those closest to the victims as suspects. Husbands and boyfriends. Next was the F.B.I.'s profile that suggested a white male was the serial killer. The author spotlights the pain and disappointment of victims' families as well as some members in law enforcement that believe Lee could have been investigated 5 years earlier, sparing lives of latter victims.Another problem in the investigations was the fact that he killed in multiple jurisdictions, crossed racial lines in selecting victims,and used different means of killing. A versatile murderer. It took time for authorities to link up the crimes.As with many cases, DNA evidence was crucial in eventually connecting Derrick Lee to 6 victims. The author explains some of the process without getting too technical."An Invisible Man.." is one of the better,recent true crime books that I have read. I recommend it.

I had a Kodak Easy Share camera before I bought a used Nikon Cool Pics 3100.The only attribute that Kodak had over this camera was ease of use. It was definitely easier to use.As much as I like this camera I can't give it a 5 in that category.As a used camera it didn't come with a manual that may have helped.This camera is versatile. There are more photo settings than I will probably ever use!It's strong points are portability and picture quality.Portability: This camera is small enough to fit into your shirt or pants pocket. Although I wouldn't recommend that.It is light and small. My wife carries it in her purse regularly.Picture Quality: I see a noticeable difference in photo quality over cameras I have owned previously. Comparing pictures in a photo album you can see an improvement with the Cool Pics.Battery Life: I have come to the conclusion that battery life is a problem with virtually every digital camera. You have three options on the battery issue;1)Buy longer life batteries. My experience is that the extra life is not long enough to justify the added cost.2)Use re-chargeable batteries. This camera came with rechargeable batteries and a charger.They don't work and another set we used for different gadgets didn't work well either.3)Buy batteries in bulk and conserve them as much as possible. We went this route.For example,don't leave the camera on for extended periods unless you're shooting photos. We buy 8 or 12 packs of Duracells or Rayovacs on sale and they last long enough for what we need.The viewer window is big enough to be effective when pointing the camera for a shot. It's accurate, no top or bottom of the photo missing the target like some cameras do.Another cool feature is the power button.It slides and is spring loaded. Push it to the right to turn on or off. It's convenient and I prefer it over a push-button.This should prevent accidentally bumping the button and draining the batteries.I almost forgot to mention another strong point; the port for downloading photos to a computer and the memory card slot are conveniently located(on the sides) and easy to access. We bought an additional memory card because of the cheap price. Downloading photos either way is really easy with the Cool Pics whether you use a $3 memory card reader or directly from the camera using a USB port cable.The Cool Pics 3100 has served us well and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera again.I plan on looking for another one when this current camera needs to be replaced in the future.

I bought BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY for two basic reasons.First, the Abridged Fifth Edition was very affordable.And I also wanted to compare it with the legal dictionary that I already have.The only negative that I can think of is the age of this edition.Despite that, I have been very happy this older edition.It's a comprehensive list of terms with over 16,000 definitions. That's considerably more than Oran's Dictionary of the Law has.I found the definitions to be thorough.The pronunciation guide is another feature that I appreciate in BLACK'S.An added bonus is the U.S. Constitution in the back of the dictionary.If you are searching for an affordable, comprehensive law dictionary this edition is worthy of consideration.

In the Preface the author elaborates on the sources he used for the book.Some sources are named while others are anonymous out of neccessity. Mr. Ritter also writes from experience as a UN weapons inspector with prior military experience.Scott Ritter describes the inspection process, the nationality of team members, and the involvement of governmental agencies from various countries.He gives some history between Iraq and America dating back to 1991 and the publicized threats from Bush 41. That administration is the source of the presidential "lethal finding" which strongly advocated the removal from power of Saddam Hussein. That regime change policy was pursued by the Clinton administration also. The Iraq Operations Group was instrumental in those efforts.Besides the Iraqi government's uncooperative actions, the author describes devious actions by the CIA.He tells about the worst covert operation failure since the Bay of Pigs. A CIA coup attempt in Iraq was effectively infiltrated by double agents.If that wasn't bad enough, someone blew the cover of a British-assisted SIGINT operation in Iraq.The failed weapons inspection program can be summed up best by the author's words on page 291- "Disarmament was simply not the USA's principal policy objective in Iraq after 1991. Regime change was."In "Iraq Confidential" Scott Ritter tells the inside story of what really happened in Iraq.

The Introduction for "The Hoffa Wars" was Jonathan Kwitney's memory of a search for Jimmy Hoffa at a remote lodge that Hoffa owned a part of. This occured two days after the disappearance and the author participated in the search in Eagle River,WI. It was an entertaining Intro.Dan Moldea's book was first published in 1978 amid harsh criticism for his suggestion that the trio of Santos Trafficante,Carlos Marcello,and Jimmy Hoffa were responsible for the JFK assassination. In the years since then, that theory has become arguably the most popularly held theory.The main topic of "The Hoffa Wars" is Jimmy Hoffa himself and the history of the Teamsters Union. A lot of corruption is detailed and Mr. Moldea makes it clear that he is no fan of Hoffa.This book covers a lot of territory; from Hoffa's early years with the local union to his eventual disappearance.The violence among rivals and the circumstances leading to mafia control of some unions is highlighted.The Nixon bribes, mafia connections, shakedowns during union "organizing" are all discussed in this book.After reading many books about the JFK assassination, This book is impressive and the author has really done his research.As far as Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance is concerned....the information that Mr. Moldea provides in this book was confirmed by Frank Sheeran in the book "I Heard You Paint Houses."The only caveat with this edition is the very small print.Despite the volume of the book, it's an easy read with no fluff. I recommend "The Hoffa Wars".

The edition of THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS - A NEW TRANSLATION that I am reviewing is the older edition, not the revised edition of 2005.I came away from reading this book with a better understanding of the times and beliefs involving the sectarians that were the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.The aim of the editors was to provide a book for the nonspecialist. They succeeded in that endeavor."In it we have aspired to be both responsible to the sources and understandable to the public."There is a clear explanation up front about missing material and how the editors addressed that problem.The editors examine the date of the scrolls and offer some suggestions for the identities of "the Wicked Priest" and " the Man of the Lie."On page 65 of the Damascus Document the Name is discussed in the context of swearing an oath- "He must not make mention of the Law of Moses, because the Name of God is written out fully in it, and if he swears by it, and then committs a sin, he will have defiled the Name."The use of the Name is also discussed in other scrolls.Some information on the Urim and Thummim was offered in Chapter 11 "Tongues of Fire". That subject has been of interest to me personally.The approach employed to interpret prophecy by some of the scroll authors is found ironically to be very similar to the approach used by Protestant Christianity.Some of the other topics of interest I read in the book are;The extreme positions in some of the sectarian laws regarding Sabbath activities they found unacceptable. The most extreme were the strict limits imposed on saving a human life.On the calendars of the time of the DSS-This was a divisive issue with a variety of methods used for reckoning time and the calendar.The importance of the calendar to two groups- the priests and the astronomers.The earliest list of zodiacal signs ever discovered in Aramaic is another interesting topic.Three extra-Biblical feasts are mentioned in the scrolls.The Wine Festival, Festival of Wood Offering, and the Festival of Oil.The editors also offered some helpful information on different Old Testament translations, some of the differences in them, and how the scrolls mirror or deviate from other manuscripts.I enjoyed the book. It's easy enough to comprehend, but the reader has to understand that this is not a complete translation because there are scroll materials missing and you will have gaps in the text.It's a useful resource in many ways. Keep in mind that there is a revised edition published after this edition.

JESUS AND MOSES-the Parallel Sayings is more than a comparison of the sayings from Jesus and Moses. That is only part of the book. Every page has Jesus' sayings compared to not only Moses, but in some cases, the Talmud (oral traditions of Judaism) and other extra-biblical sources.Some of what I found to be positive aspects of the book were;The similarities of ethics both from Jesus and the sages of Judaism.The editor casts some light on a different perspective of the "dead" in Matthew 8:22."Follow me, and the let the dead bury their own dead."The editor also details some of the differences between Christianity and Judaism. This may have more value to persons that haven't thought or read about the other religion.There are mainly two issues with the book that I find debatable.The use of the NIV for New Testament quotes is one.The second is the idea expressed on page 89 that "Paul, however, determined to attract pagan converts to Christianity..." I agree that in early "Christian" history believers were steered away from Torah and pagans were incorporated in large numbers. But I believe that was long after Paul's time.The title is somewhat misleading in that the reader is getting more than a comparison of Jesus' sayings with Moses' sayings.The book may come in handy for some readers as a handy,organized resource book.
