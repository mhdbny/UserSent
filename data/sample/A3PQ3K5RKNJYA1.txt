All we needed was a bunch of female egotists doing what normally is [executed] by witless males in a movie like this. They're over their heads (or under, in this case) when a gaggle of women decide to go spelunking and wind up being ripped to shreds and eaten piecemeal (pun intended) by a bunch of very hungry cave ghouls (for want of a more descriptive term).What follows is the usual "offing" one-by-one of the adventurists. Well, not all of them. Horrific scenes (guffaw!) are not too subtle (chortle!), bloody (snicker!), and very predictable. The spelunkers get their "just desserts".... Or, at least the ghouls do (snort!).Blood, gore, screams, yelling, dismemberment - almost like watching an old Ozzie Osborn concert. Still a very entertaining horror flick.

Christopher Walken's excellent portrayal of the troubled Johnny Smith, who develops psychic abilities after recovering from a five year coma. He's able to see the future (as well as trace back to the past of a crime scene) of certain events, and takes measures into his own hands to stop the tragic circumstances before they occur. Martin Sheen plays the ruthless and unscrupulous politician, Greg Stillson; with his future sights on The White House in mind. This doesn't escape Johnny, who must stop Stillson from leading the World into an Apocalyptic future event.There are some heart-breaking scenes (one hint: "The Ice Is Gonna Break!"), especially the inescapable and inevitable demise of Johnny, in his assassination attempt on Greg Stillson. One of Christopher Walken's best. Ably supported by Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt and Herbert Lom.

Before even watching this movie I blew it off as a hack ripoff of action hero movies. But I soon found out how fun this movie was to watch. If anything, Vin Diesel got his point across that he wasn't trying to portray (ahem) other action heroes in a serious way.Vin Diesel was extremely funny, and I think if people just take this as a "Fun Action Movie" they'd really enjoy it, instead of just cutting Vin down as a wannabee. Unlike the blowhard critics, you really ought to watch this movie without any preconceived notions of a "ripoff." Darn it, you'll really enjoy it. I did!

can turn a somber occasion into a laugh riot! Absolutely one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. The Brits really know how to make fun of themselves and make people laugh all over the World. I laughed so uncontrollably loud, my neighbors thought I was going crazy in this Frank Oz directed movie. The ongoing "Valium" gag was the real clincher in this movie; affecting Alan Tudyk's (Firefly, 3:10 To Yuma, Knocked Up) "Simon" to Peter Vaughn's "Uncle Alfie." Peter Dinklage (In Bruges, 30 Rock, Nip/Tuck) adds fire to the Valium-induced high-jinks. Andy Nyman as Howard was uproariously funny. Bang-Bang laughs from the improbable happenings at a funeral service. Matthew MacFayden as "Daniel," the long-suffering son, trying to keep order and decorum at his Dad's funeral, was the sinking sand amongst the solid rocks in attendance. Too funny.

But if you must know. It's the usual pathetic acting job by Meg Ryan that really brings down this movie. Little wonder most of her movies in the past 8 years have sucked. I can't believe she's cast in serious roles. Never works. Don't waste your time with this one, unless you're a Russell Crowe fan - then it's all right.

I don't see how some reviewers missed the subplots or thought there were too many. I guess they must suffer from ADD. I got the whole story the first time around, and have watched it many more times for the great dramatic and emotional impact it takes the viewer through. I also think a lot of reviewers forget to watch the acting, besides just the story line. In this I feel that Kate Winslet delivered an absolutely magnificent, emotional and gut-wrenching performance; as did Laura Linney and of course, Kevin Spacey.Too many people have preconceived notions about a movie before it even begins to tell the story, and end up convincing themselves that a movie is bad in comparison to this or that movie; which is a waste of time and thought (unless it's an intentional wanna-be type movie). Gosh, just look and listen. Try to be impartial, even though there may be a message; albeit forced-fed at times to the viewer (Libs and Cons take note).The more I see great acting (like that of the principals in this movie), the more I appreciate how much work actors put into their characters and how hard it is to "stay in character" as the filming goes on for weeks or months. It's really easy to act badly, but difficult to act convincingly. Can't say enough about the first-rate jobs by the entire cast of this movie. Bravo!

Not much more can be added to all the accolades offered by reviewers in the past. I most admire the painstaking handiwork of the Set Designer(s) and Decorator(s) of this monumental film. Hauntinlgy beautiful and yet sordid scenes from the future. Masterful direction by Ridley ScottLoved Harrison Ford and Edward James Olmos portrayals of the forced-out-of retirement "Blade Runner," Deckard and the grudgingly former Blade Runner and overseer, Gaff. Rutger Hauer's masterful job as Roy Batty is unforgettable if not just for his final scene and touching dialogue before death. Sean Young as Rachel, is so beautiful and alluring; as is Joanna Cassidy in her short role as "Zhora." Brion James as "Leon" is as creepy as any of the characters he's played in other movies. And not forgetting Darryl Hanna as the gymnastic "Pris," rounds out the "Replicants" that Deckard is assigned to destroy.One of the greatest Sci-Fi Adventures film ever.

Season Two is a jewel. I"m not sure if anyone watching the episode "Park Safety" will be able to get past the scene (without rolling on the floor in an uncontrollable fit of laughter) where Jerry bends down during his video presentation, splits his pants open and farts. Andy Samberg guest stars.Tom Haverford experiences an epiphany of sorts, when he looks at an abstract painting and carries on, to no end; about the shapes - absolutely hilarious in "The Camel". Ron Swanson having unbridled sex with his hated ex-wife, Tammy (Megan Mullally) in "Ron And Tammy." Andy Dwyer, the no-clue doofus, shoe-shine boy; tackling a possum, who bit the Mayor's dog on the golf range (The Possum). Also, Ron Swanson experiencing a "toe-gasm" while Andy is shining one of his shoes; emitting an animal-like sound in the process (The Camel). Just a few of the insane scenes that occur in this set.Oh, and you're going to love the annoying, obnoxious, self-absorbed character of Jean-Ralphio; Tom Haverford's friend and co-investor in The Snakehole Lounge. He appears in "The Setup," "Woman Of The Year" (outtakes are priceless) and "The Master Plan" The very pretty Rashida Jones plays Leslie's close friend and confidant, Ann Perkins.I don't care what anyone says - This show is funnier, and has a more versatile cast than "The Office." Aziz Ansari, as Tom Haverford; is ten times funnier than Dwight or Andy from The Office. And Amy Poehler's Leslie Knope isn't an incompetent, half-wit buffoon of a boss; like Michael Scott.Boo-la! Boo-la!

Well not really. As a matter of fact, Dirty Harry doesn't even use his magnum to dispense the rogue cops. Davis (David Soul) is drown-fu'd, Grimes (Robert Urich) is car-fu'd, Astrachan (Kip Niven) is chop-fu'd and Lt. Briggs (Hal Holbrook) is bomb-fu'd by Harry. Sweet (Tim Matheson) is shotgun-fu'd in an ambush by the bad guys while serving a "Warrant"The really good parts were the shooting range introductions of Dirty Harry to all the rogue cops (minus Rogue Boss - Briggs). Where Harry tells the traffic cops he uses "light specials" - meaning .44 Special ammunition; which I don't believe, due to the recoil of the gun. He's using full-power magnums, alright. Officer Sweet (Tim Matheson) gets to shoot Harry's big gun. "It was just a little heavy, I missed one" says Sweet.Also, the combat pistol-shooting championships pit the Colt blue steel 4-inch .357 magnum 125gr JHP's and HKS speedloaders of David Soul vs. The Smith and Wesson blue steel 6-inch Model 29 .44 magnum using 180gr or 210gr jhp's and Safariland speedloaders of Clint Eastwood. Yarrrrrs, mateys! Those were the days when "real men" fired full-power magnum loads, not your pip-sqeak 9mm's in later movies.Robert Urich in his pre - "S.W.A.T.", "VEGAS" and "Spenser For Hire" days. Tim Matheson in his pre - "Animal House" days. David Soul in his pre - "Starsky and Hutch" days (although he did end up using a Colt Python 6-inch .357 magnum on that show). Kip Niven in his pre - Jacklyn Smith days. And Hal Holbrook in his pre - Dixie Carter "Southern Comfort" days.Oh, the plot or the premise of this movie? Read the other reviews.

Wow. I've seen better 10 minute videos on You Tube. The dialogue via subtitles are from a high school play. It's almost a parody of some very bad sci-fi movies. Below-amateur writing, production, directing and editing. I watched it twice with theatre and then movie production people. We all had a wonderful time- CHORTLE! SNEER! GUFFAW! SNICKER! Even Ernie Fosselius' "Hardware Wars" was superior to this tripe. Serious students of film will barf at 19.25 minutes.On my list of "The 100 Worst Films I've Ever Seen." This is one of those DVD's that you can use as a signaling mirror if you're lost on a deserted island.

It really doesn't matter to me if no one agrees with my opinion of this season, because these are personal opinions and not votes for a popularity contest.The Office has steadily declined the past three years. The character of Michael Scott, as the half-wit, half-moron, incompetent boss, was really getting old. There just weren't anymore really standout episodes that were funny. It's like the writers just ran out of ideas, and put a new (and boring) twist to an old theme. Dwight's and Andy's antics were no longer funny, and the sappy, insipid relationship (okay, marriage) of Pam and Jim, was just that - sappy and insipid. The rest of the cast were just plain boring.The season finale could not have stunk any more than it did. What an anti-climax! Yes, they will go on, because they need paychecks, but they'll lose more viewers to the funnier "Parks And Recreation" as the next season goes by. This show has really bottomed-out. Only the die-hard lover's of this show will continue watch it to its ultimate death.

Lousy premise, lousy acting, lousy filming techniques, lousy color and hues that didn't do anything to change the feeling of the movie. It wasn't scary, it wasn't thrilling. Tedious doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Was the director asleep? Did he just let the actors improvise all the scenes?

Sometimes you wonder why people put money, time and talent into a piece of garbage like this. If they had only given me the funds that were wasted on this movie, I would have invested it and made millions.Neo-Noir? I'd spell it C-R-A-P. The script flew out of the car, onto the highway and wasn't numbered. So they just stapled it all together without checking with anyone and you got this.It was like watching a Charlie Sheen look-alike acting badly. At 82 minutes into the movie (a miracle I go that far into it) I was contemplating pulling out the DVD and using it for target practice at the range. Robert Loggia played his oft-repeated tough-guy mobster role, Gary Busey in his pre-druggie days, and Patricia Arquette as the spaced-out, airhead girlfriend of Mr. Eddy (Loggia) who likes "doing it" with the Charlie Sheen guy (I forgot and don't care what his name was). Robert Blake played a hideous little imp with flour makeup.I truly believe these type movies are made for when you are either drunk or stoned; or both. At 107 minutes you'll either be laughing out loud or screaming for the director's head. I'd be like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, and have the Key Grip punch out the Director and then I'd improvise and have the rest of the crew punch out the writer(s). Oh yeah, Bill Pullman wasn't very convincing as the spaced-out screeching sax player earlier in this tripe. You know what? Everyone involved in this movie was spaced-out.What do you do with garbage? You throw it out. Do the same with this movie.

I thought I'd seen some quirky comedies, but this one has become my favorite of them all. Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand and Robert Downey Jr. are at their quirkiest in this goofy tale about a group of writers (no need to elaborate, as other reviewers have already covered the story). I've never been a fan of Katie Holmes; only because of her limited acting range (compared to the other cast members).It makes you wonder if there really are strange people out there like this. And if you knew them, what would that make you? The dead dog (Poe) in the trunk drove me crazy.Very weird, very strange movie.

Well, if you aren't touched at least 65 minutes into the film (the hospital scene), I don't know when it'll hit you. Wow. Great performances by Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish and Brad Pitt, as Joe (Death) Black. Claire Forlani couldn't have been better cast for her part as Susan (Bill's daughter); a doctor in the hospital in which Joe makes an unscheduled visit. There's also a very touching scene between Bill (speaking of his late wife) and Joe, over a cold lamb sandwich.Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, and Marcia Gay Harden as Allison ("throwing the Birthday Party of the Century" - for her Dad, Bill) lend great support to this story of a man's soon-to-be demise from the world. And Jake Weber as Drew, the long-suffering boyfriend of Susan (and also the back-stabbing business partner of Bill), who really takes a mental pounding from Joe; which at times is hilarious. The second dinner scene with a slight confrontation between Drew and Joe may leave you in stitches.Thought-provoking lessons in living one's life to the fullest, by not taking for granted the little things we ignore while trying to go about "making a living" instead of "living life." Okay, that was corny, but I had to say it. And don't forget your appreciation of peanut butter(?). Of course, you'll have to get used to "Death" kissing Susan. "Thank You" - "You're Welcome."Love, friendship, family, trust, relations, allegiances. We should all go out in style, like Bill. And Mr. Joe Black was really an agent from the IRS. What a great movie. What an ending. "No Regrets"

Unlike other reviews that felt the movie was a bit too long, I felt that the pacing fit perfectly with all the principals investigative skills and the fantastic and engrossing acting abilities of Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Elias Koteas. You feel the tension, pain, confusion and frustration these [investigators], both police and journalist experienced through their investigation(s) of this infamous murder suspect. Brian Cox played a short but admirable part as Attorney Melvin Belli; who's office I once had the pleasure of "visiting", picking up legal documents as a process server in the City of San Francisco. What a character he was. And what a great group of good-looking "female legal assistants" he had in that office.The more I watch such top-notch acting jobs performed by these stars, the more I appreciate how much work and effort they put into their jobs that sometimes make you feel like they're the real characters and not acting. Superb Directing by David Fincher.What a great movie. I live right next to San Francisco (Daly City) and was in high school when these killings started. They were the talk of the town. One of the best murder-suspense movies ever made.

A painful and laborious game of trying to catch the killer of "The Black Dahlia." I'm glad I read the book a few years ago. At least it held my attention more than this movie.Josh Hartnett, as "Bucky - ICE" the L.A. Detective is a real boring and stiff. Aaron Eckhardt, as "Lee - FIRE," his partner was intense, but average. Scarlett Johannson, "Kay" and Hilary Swank, "Madeleine" were also big bores, and they showed it with their acting.It was almost like watching a stage play; with the dinner at Madeleine's house being excruciatingly painful to watch. As was the "love scene" with Hartnett and Swank, which looked like a "Carol Burnett Show" or "Saturday Night Live" parody of a classic movie. Some of these scenes will make you or snicker or laugh; which in effect, will wake you up and out of your boredom enough to finish the movie.At 53 minutes into the movie, I checked the timing display to find that the movie is 121 minutes long. As Doctor Smith from "Lost In Space" used to say: "The pain. Oh, the pain."

I agree that Sean Young (Kate Gekko) should have switched parts with Hannah.Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox were excellent. The very touching scene between Bud and his dad Carl (Martin Sheen) in the hospital was one of the more memorable in this great movie.

So, he was a musical genius, so what? I always like the way people ignore the fact that some musical geniuses were plain out of their skulls. Through the years, a lot of jazz musicians (professional and non) paid (and continue to pay) homage to this guy, but would never be able to work for such a schizoid personality.People let it slide all the weird things he did, and the way he treated other musicians in a sort of "blind faith" following. From what I've read in many books from musicians who've worked for him, and watching this video, it's almost as if they'd bow to him and lick his boots because they got notoriety from playing in his band (i.e. he may be abusive and obtuse, but man, I can make some money and be famous working for him).Then you get the snooty "know-it-all's" who worship him and look beyond his crass idiosyncrasies because they want to be part of the "In Crowd" in-the-know about this musical genius. But would never for a moment, want to possess his psychological profile, nor would they even consider socializing with this "fruitcake" if it were not for his music alone.He was an Underdog in his own mind, and brought upon his own paranoia due to his radical viewpoint towards life. Yeah, I like some of his music. But he was a "space cadet" in every sense of the word.

This is rock-jazz, jazz-rock at its most sophisticated. AJA and Deacon Blues are reason enough to buy this CD. Listening to Wayne Shorter's tenor solo on AJA and Pete Christlieb's solo on Deacon Blues should be inspiration and schooling on improvisation to all tenor saxophonists. Great horn section playing and contributions from Tom Scott and Steve Gadd supplying some masterful drumming.

You know, the really bad ones you have to sit through because your son or daughter has a part in it? Whoever this Dash what's-her-name actress is, I believe could be voted as one of the worse performances in a stupid, inane, boring and lifeless film. I mean, she really sucks. Special effects - laughable. I think I remember seeing the old man in TRON. And the little dude in the bar from "The Blade Runner." The interaction between characters really does border on truly amateurish. Someone mentioned a 4 million dollar budget? Sounds about right. Don't waste tour time or money on this clunker.

The run-up to the heist was kind of slow, but then again I can see how they wanted to setup the whole caper for us to understand. Very tense, exciting and full of twists in the plot. The scumbags, radicals, small-time hoods, crooked and straight cops, MI5 or MI6 and Royals all come together; well, not all at the same time. I really enjoyed this movie.Sex, politics, burglary, robbery, murder, deception, torture - it's all here.

Chick Corea's "Spain," opening with Frank Tiberi's beautiful bassoon and the flute of Gary Anderson. Then picking up the tempo with a great Dennis Dotson flugelhorn solo towards the end. And John LaBarbera's "Toothless Grin" featuring the tenor sax of Gregory Herbert (I played this chart in jazz band).The other "Pop charts" weren't as catchy and sort of sappy. This was an one of those albums where Woody followed a musical trend, rather than lead one.

Why did it seem like Tommy Lee Jones was doing his 'Strannix thing" from "Under Siege" in this movie? The plot winds into predictable end that makes you say "Where have I seen this before?"

I thought I remembered this as being a good movie when I was a kid. Upon seeing this movie again, some thirty-five years later; I was wrong. The acting is terrible and the story has more than a few technical flaws that really irked me. Such as the soldiers with no grenandes hanging from their web gear (they magically appear during the battle scenes), or only one BAR in the entire company, and no one wearing bandoleers of ammo for their M-1 rifles. And one of the biggest faux's was the use of German MP-40's (9mm subguns) by both the Americans and Japanese (In the Pacific War?).A cheaply made movie (technically speaking) for only the psychological impact. I guess I'm just used to more realism than was displayed in this movie. If you've ever seen bad acting when a soldier is getting shot - a la "Hell Is For Heroes," then you're really going to laugh at the way guys die in this movie. Ugh! I'm donating my video to the local library.

Uhhhh.....There's this one scene where the Gov't agents led by Agent Keyes (Gary Busey. Remember Mr. Joshua in Lethal Weapon?) attempt to corral the Predator in a over-sized meat locker; they're supposed to be wearing these suits that block out their heat signature (that's how Predator sees you) but they are carrying these 1 million candle-power lamps, which generate heat. Okay, one glaring inconsistency that most people wouldn't notice.Danny Glover (Harrigan), the rogue cop (remember Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon?) is mis-cast in this strange, goofy sequel to the original (the original, being far superior to this offering). And in fact, acts like the Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon. Maybe, they should have asked Mel Gibson to play his side-kick in this one. Nahhhhhh..... wouldn't have made a difference.Reuben Blades (Danny) and Bill Paxton (Lambert), who play the other cops in Glover's "team" get their turns being gutted by the Predator. And Maria Conchita Alonzo (Leona) plays a stereotypical rough-and-tumble, almost-gutted female cop, who's spared by the Predator; because she's pregnant. Boy, does she have some terrible lines.Oh well, there's lots of gunfire (and lots of bad acting) in the opening scenes (with lotsa' scumbags), and in the transit car gun battle (armed citizens and gang members) with about every assault weapon available (at that time)!The final duel with Murtaugh, I mean Harrigan is anti-climactic. To say the least. Kent McCord (ADAM-12, for you oldsters) is Glover's superior.

The end is worth watching this whole movie. With Giovanni Ribisi uttering this great line at the end that'll catch your thoughts. Cate Blanchett always amazes me with her ability do drop her Australian accent and take up the different regional accents of Americans she portrays (Pushing Tin, Bandits, Shipping News) and does it so flawlessly. She's got a fine supporting cast of the aforementioned Ribisi, Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Gary Cole, Kim Dickens, J.K. Simmons and Greg Kinnear. Katie Holmes part is really minor, even tough she ends up being the subject of the greater storyline. Twists and turns that make it the more interesting. But above all, the stellar performance of Cate Blanchett as the psychic, Annie Wilson.

Drew Barrymore was too cute and innocent, but not bad. Eric Bana playing the obsessed poker-playing pro was boring and somewhat of a veiled ripoff of Matt Damon's excellent character in the superior movie "Rounders."Even though you get to see some "Real World poker players" such as Phil Helmut, Daniel Negreanu, Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson," it didn't help the awful plot of pitting father (Robert Duvall) against son (Eric Bana).

Well, I've always liked John's writing (for Buddy Rich, Bill Watrous - Tiger of San Pedro, Woody Herman - Toothless Grin, etc) and when Don Menza left Buddy's band and Pat took over the jazz Tenor chair; before leaving for Elvin Jones. Pat LaBarbera has matured so much in his improvisations through the years, that I never tire of listening to his new ideas.These charts and the band really swing, proving once again that John LaBarbera can put together a first-class jazz band. Just like on his previous CD: On The Wild Side. What else can you expect from the LaBarbera brothers?Yep, jazz has been relegated to that "other music" that a lot of young and old don't care for, or understand. But you can't re-live yesterdays jazz triumphs; just move on an enjoy the great jazz that's still created for us today.

Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Kenny, are marvelously outrageous in this dark comedy. Ralph Fiennes as Harry ("He swears a lot, doesn't he?"), adds his own darkness and humor to this excellent movie. The "Nooks and Crannies" or "Alcoves" dialogue with Ken and Yuri was particularly funny. As was Ray and Harry's conversational "shootout" scene at Marie's hotel.There were also a few very sad and touching scenes of Ray; flashing back to his accidentally killing an innocent young boy in the church during his assassination of a priest. And the subsequent attempt to take his own life in the park as Ken stops him. Colin Farrell gives a convincing performance as he conveys to Ken, the need to end his life. Kenny in turn, trying to talk Ray out of it, by emphasizing it would serve no purpose and wouldn't bring back the life of the child he took. A real tear-jerker.Thekla Reuten as Marie, is absolutely gorgeous. As is Clemence Poesy as Chloe, the only thing in Bruges that peaked Ray's interest and kept his mind off the boredom (and the dead boy). Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) the "racist midget" actor, was equally adept to bringing forth his own brand of humor and "off-color" points of view. Yes, there were some pretty bloody scenes in the movie, but not enough to detract from the overall comedy that shone through the darkness of this film.

Okay - You've got the Vice Presidential plane (with David Keith aboard) traveling over the Pacific Ocean without Naval escort fighters, in a tropical storm that should have been predicted and avoided. The storm puts the plane down near an unknown island (Barago!). No emergency call, no secondary channel, no emergency transponder beeping after the plane goes down. And last but not least, only one Secret Service Agent onboard (Mariel Hemingway). The President orders a search for the "Second most powerful man in the World" Duh.... The President comes across as a real low I.Q. doofus. The Naval Admiral is also an idiot.After some "A-Team type" gun battles, the Guerillas take the VP hostage for a large ransom (what else?). Mariel takes only a 9mm subgun, instead of an assault rifle, from the scumbags. The Guerilla leader is especially obnoxious in the acting department. I mean, low-down, amateur, stinking bad acting. Hemingway and Keith must have taken the lead from the extras; because they were just as bad. You'll wonder why the person who wrote the dialogue wasn't left on the island; where everything else about this movie should have been left. Oh, and it seemed like they hired some pretty bad Samoan or Hawaiian actors for this stinker. They grunt a lot.If you can stand just killing time and watching a [horrible] movie, then go ahead. Heck, you can go to the "John" a few times, go out for some pizza, and even walk your dog. You won't miss anything. When jobs in Hollywood are sparse, I guess you take anything yo can get (Mariel and David did) and hope that at least the director can save the script (he didn't.) Absolutely stunk !

Ever see a movie that takes you so far that you actually see the characters as someone really talking in front of you? Will Smith, Lisa Bonet and Tom Sizemore (amongst the others), are acting too hard. They weren't convincing enough to make me feel like they were real characters. Again, the action was great. But the acting was contrived and predictable.

I agree with everyone who's said this movie was bad, stunk, predictable, etc. Pacino running around with a Phil Spector-like "hairdo" was laughable. Alicia Witt, playing one of his students spouted out her lines as if she were reading at an audition. She gave a particularly atrocious acting job in this stinker, that I was really hoping she'd be the next victim to die. The little parts where Pacino is freaking-out, staring at his students, wondering if any one of them was involved in framing him was something out of a You Tube parody. Racing around town in a cab, with the cab driver calmly sitting in the back seat making his hundreds of bucks so that.............oh fergit it. Folks, this is a no-go.

This was a real surprise movie for me. Having heard this movie mentioned so much, but not knowing the premise is what really caught me off-guard. What a freakin' spooky movie!!! I loved the way the movie was pieced together after each spooky ocurrance, so that you knew what led up to the demise of each individual; instead of trying to guess. I especially liked the fact that it was made in Japan, and the some of the American actors had to try and communicate in Japanese.Let's see now... cats, attics, cell phones, closets. I think I should try and avoid all those things in the night from now on. What the heck was that noise? What was that little boy doing in my sink?Oh damn! I gotta' shampoo my hair in the morning (check for extra fingers in scalp), and then take the bus to work (look out for reflections in the window) I don't think I'm ever going to sleep in my bed again. That sofa is looking pretty good from here. Aaaaahhhhhhhhh!

By modern day standards, this squad has low-tech weapons and tactics. I mean even American SWAT teams at this time had better armor, weapons and tactics.Maybe because this was a low budget film they couldn't afford newer weapons and options that are standard equipment on even the poorest US SWAT teams. Their assault tactics looked elementary; such as maneuvering in bright lights instead of dim; bunching up in alleys, running into a situation without enough ammo, etc. Plus, no reflex sights, no night scopes, Kevlar helmets, comm VOX headsets.In one scene one of heir "Elites" is racking and dry-firing his Glock, and then pointing it at his buddy, which was really stupid and psychotic. Training - okay. Execution - lousy. No Elites; just a bunch of clowns. Oh, they looked pretty effective shooting and torturing suspects; which I'm sure a lot of American police depts would love to do without any repercussions.

Cleverly woven story that comes to a head when U.S. Attorney General James Wells (Wilford Brimley) "Lays down The Law" to reporter Megan Carter (Sally Field), Strike Force leader Elliott Rosen (Bob Balaban), investigator Robert Waddell (Barry Primus) and District Attorney Jim Quinn (Don Hood) for trying to "get something" on Michael Gallagher (Paul Newman); who ends up turning the tables on everyone trying to use him.Great morality play on The Press (and their Spin Control) and a lesson on comeuppence for "just doing one's job."First-rate acting from all the principals.

Goofy, stupid movie, with all the usual cliche's of dumb Americans (usually Caucasians) who get themselves into situations with "the unseen horrors of this world" - woooooooo! All these people needed was a an airstrike of Weed-B-Gone.The vines ringing like bells and chasing the two women in the cave reminded me of "The Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes." Some of the dialogue in the scenes were absolutely hilarious and laughable. The amputation scene was a riot. If you've nothing else to watch; this is an average horror movie for a laugh,

From the opening Nestico chart "Ya' Gotta' Try" with barn-burning solo exchanges between Steve Marcus and Gary Pribek to the closing encore number "Big Swing Face" with an enduring extended tenor solo by Gary Pribek; this DVD cooks!This has by far the best version of Bob Kaye's "Grand Concourse" with Andy Fusco blowing chorus after chorus of imaginative improvisation. His solo is so hot that midway he makes a "statement" that elicits the approval of section-mates Steve Marcus and Chuck Wilson."Little Train" shows off the blowing talents of trumpeters Mike McGovern and John Marshall as well as the trombones of Dale Kirkland and Glen Franke, with Andy Fusco's hard -driving solo sandwiched between them."Channel One Suite" showcases Steve Marcus and his trademark solo interlude with touches of finger-snapping blues tenor interjected before his cadenza and then Buddy's extended solo.This is the best DVD of the Buddy Rich Big Band; even though Rich At The Top (1973) and Live At The Montreal Jazz Festival (1982) are no slouches.

I'm not sure what when on in Bob Greattinger's head when he wrote this music, but it is very haunting. Some of this stuff could be used in soundtrack of a Sci-Fi movie.I can see how some of the musicians who played on these tracks said that their teeth hurt, after playing through this masterpiece. Talk about dissonance.I used to put this album on on Halloween, when people came over to my place. They always freaked-out when listening to the City Of Glass movements. It got so bad that some of my friends told me to shut off the music, because it was so weird. I loved it, and still do to this day. Bob Graettinger was a freaky genius; in his own spaced-out way.

So here's where actors and actresses who work as waiters and waitresses go. Most "big name" directors would tell these people "keep your day job".For Special OPs people they ride in an old Huey (low budget could not afford a Black Hawk). They use regular M4's with only flashlite attachments. No lasers or special sights (cheap budget).Cuba Gooding is pretty pathetic in this one. He shoots a "zombie" in the head, and one of his soldiers in another room asks "what was that?" Soldiers who are used to gunfire asking what a shot was? Franky G trying his worst to be a Jesse Ventura clone (a la Predator) comes off laughable. There's one scene where one female soldier starts shooting at a "vision" of her daughter, then two of her buddies join in shooting at nothing; emptying their mags in the process. - "What were we shooting at?" exclaims one of the idiot soldiers. Uh-boy.Most of the scenes are laughable and amateurish. Forget this STINKER!

Sharon Stone, as the psychotic Catherine Trammel, isn't even sexy. She looks and acts like a 900 sex-talk liar. The party with all the weirdo freak writers in which some of them didn't even recognize Sharon Stone's character, right after she's been on the news, was really stupid. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass (David Morissey) was one sex-addicted, wimpy, weak-willed wanker (how's that for alliteration). Anyway, this is definitely one of those movies in which you've got to be pretty dumb not to figure out what's going to happen next. What a predictable flop.

Great job by Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal) and Jodie Foster (Clarice). It wasn't scary or as yucky as people told me. I'm still one of the believers that "SE7EN" is a much superior movie. This was on O.K. movie. Intense, yes. But not that shocking. I don't understand what the talk has been about, all these years. I wasn't that impressed. Maybe I was trying too hard to compare Hopkins to Kevin Spacey. But then again, Hopkins has more space to develop in this movie than Spacey did. But Kevin Spacey didn't need it. There I go again - comparing. Oooooops!

I ask only because he was the one who really made this film funny. Also, the short, but memorable appearance of the gorgeous Jenna Fischer (The Office), as Whisper, the call-girl. Great story line of immorality, deception, misdirection and eventual double-crossing criminals. I kind of sneaks up on you.Good work by Matt Dillon as David Walsh, the banker with a "Performance Review" bad enough to get him fired. Christina Applegate, as his fiance Sara Goodwin. Andrea Bendewald as Wendy; David's banking co-worker and Sara's Maid-Of-Honor that David's screws, and who ends up screwing David in the end.But most of all, kudos to Steve Zahn as Jack/Wyatt, who's pilfering of jewelry from corpses of accidents, his outrageous homophobic remarks to David's unlicensed dentist, Eric (Dave Foley - NewsRadio) and his gay friends, and a sexual liaison with an under-age stripper, really put this weird movie over-the-top.

Were it not for the inclusion of Denise Richards in this movie, I would have enjoyed it a [bit] more. One can usually forgive all the characters that are thrown in a Bond film. But I cannot stress enough the unbearable scenes in which Denise Richards opens her pie-hole; as if reading straight from the script with no feeling. She wrecked the entire film.Not one of the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Especially with the goofy story line of the wacko Renard, who doesn't feel pain. And M, getting involved too closely in the operation, leading to her kidnapping.

If nothing else but for Don Menza's cooking chart "Time Check." Yeah sure, some of the charts sound pretty dated with the "wah-wah guitar" sound. But there are still some good selections here. Greg Hopkins treatment of Horace Silver's "Nutville" with Hopkins and Pat LaBarbera doing the solo chores. The catchy "Waltz Of The Mushrooms Hunters" with Buddy Budson on electric piano and Pat LaBarbera on soprano sax. Manny Albam's Kilimanjaro Cookout (yeah, with the wah-wah).Backwoods Sideman and Senator Sam feature more Pat LaBarbera and the under-rated Bob Crea (checkout these charts on You Tube). And you can see the exciting "live performance" of Time Check with Pat LaBarbera on the Buddy Rich DVD "Buddy Rich - At The Top."

This album was originally released in 1974, not 1971. This was after the breakup of the big band with Jazz Tenor Pat LaBarbera (The Roar Of '74) and before "The Big Band Machine" with Steve Marcus. Sonny Fortune on alto, and veteran Herman sideman - Sal Nistico on tenor; are the frontline players. I believe Jack Wilkins on guitar, Kenny Baron on piano, Jimmy Maeulen on congas and Anthony Jackson on bass.I thought this was a pretty good album when it first came out. I liked Nica's Dream (though not as much as Stan Getz's) and Chameleon (Maynard Ferguson's swung more) so much, that I transcribed all the parts for a small combo I played with. Jumpin' At The Woodside and Billie's Bounce aren't bad either. But altogether, it wasn't as swingin' as his big band (which goes without saying - but I said it anyway).

No, really. Keep in mind that this was the band Rich put together to record (not counting the pickup big band with Sal Nistico in '74) after disbanding the "Roar Of '74" band (1973) and going to a small combo format (Nistico, Sonny Fortune, Jack Wilkins, etc.,) and a few albums with Zoot Sims and Lionel Hampton. This was our introduction to the late Steve Marcus, who turned out to be an outstanding jazz tenor for Rich until Buddy's death in 1987. Bob Minzter is also in the section on tenor - later to become a top arranger and big band leader, himself.If you listen closely to the "Tommy Medley" you may not think of it as a "dated" or "cop-out" piece - From the opening bass line, congas and then Roger Rosenberg's bari (yeah, you can hear some wah-wah guitar), this chart really starts burning. The saxes state the theme, with the brass joining in. After a brief trombone solo in the second movement, Danny Hayes takes off on trumpet on a long, bopping solo. Then Rich and the congas help close it out."Pieces Of Dreams" is a beautiful, moody song with the saxes playing the melody with short, injected solos from the lead trumpet and trombone. A really nice, pleasant, easy-going big band arrangement (I've got it. And have played it with a big band)."Lush Life" starts off with a very nice trumpet solo, before switching off to a trombone solo.The bands rendition of "Ease On Down The Road" is not bad, with a tenor solo from Steve Marcus. Although the "fade" is kind of corny with Danny Hayes' trumpet in the background."West Side Story Medley '75" is really condensed. With only the tenor solo and then right into Buddy's solo along with the congas and a bass solo. Not one of the better editions of "West Side Story."Still, not a bad album for a second comeback with his Big Band.

Classic Sci-Fi at its best. What a great character! Seemed like Snake was always in a bad mood, which helps when you're dropped into a city (or prison) filled with scum. Harry Dean Stanton's character was funny, Donald Pleasance as the inept President, and Isaac Hayes as "The Duke" - "A" Number One. Best of all: Adrienne Barbeau..... Oh, her acting was pretty good, too.

So the deal with the defibrillator was hopelessly overdone - Small oversight to an interesting yet dangerous premise. Really enjoyed all the acting in this movie. Especially the inventive and quirky character Randy, played by Oliver Platt, who was the only main character who didn't "Flatline."Kevin Bacon's remorseful visit to the girl he harassed in grade school was uplifting. William Baldwin as Joe, got a well-deserved comeuppance from his nefarious "ego-sexual" past. Julia Roberts closure with the ghost of her Dad was the most touching. Kiefer Sutherland's "Nelson" really got the short end of the stick; even though his "experience" was the most deadly (emphasis on "deadly") leading to a really great ending.

Cornball plot but cool movie nonetheless. Although Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins acts and talks like she's spaced-out (i.e. reading from a script) like she tends to do in a lot of her movies. Jude Law's (Sky Captain) voice somehow always seems to grate on me.The digital special effects seem to take one back to another time in film-making (yeah, I know). Though the acting was rather stiff; especially from Angelina Jolie, it was a fun adventure film. Funny also with Gwyneth Paltrow and her camera; deciding whether or not to take a shot, knowing full well she's almost out of film.The "robot monsters" were pretty cool. But it was kind of stupid that Sky Captain was flying a "prop job" (P-40) with some "futuristic hardware" that didn't go with the airplane.Giovanni Ribisi plays Dex, the chewing gum chomping stereotype of a mechanical wiz that's a throwback from the "old movies" - yeah, I know, that's the way it was meant to be. But he over-acted to the point of being very annoying.

This movie really held my attention. Richard Gere was perfect. I was astonished that Clifford Irving seemingly didn't really care that he was creating lies on top of lies. Well, yeah he cared enough to continue the deception so that he, his wife Edith (Marcia Gay Harden) and his cohort Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina) were always one step ahead of being uncovered (almost). His obsession with "The Hoax" was so powerful, he began to believe he was actually meeting Howard Hughes.Particularly entertaining were the scenes when Irving took on the persona of Howard Hughes ( by listening to tape recordings of him) in attempts to actually "feel" the inner sanctum of the Hughes psyche. Also the perceived reality (dreams) that he was kidnapped by the CIA to answer to Hughes about the whole deception.I really enjoyed this movie and felt there were no flat spots in it; due in part, to Irving's constant juggling of lies between the publishers and everyone else suspicious of his and Suskind's dealings. And the persistent paranoia of Dick Suskind (in which Irving blew off, most of the time) that ended up permeating the mind of Irving himself, in the end.

Despite the high jinks, bumbling and fumbling of Dabney Coleman's Cops and that of small-time hood Nicolas Cage, the racial issue between Blacks and Whites was still able to get the message across; that despite our open-mindness, there's still a racial divide in many parts of your country. Of course, you'd have to have just landed on Earth not to realize that.Still, an entertaining and very funny movie with Samuel L. Jackson as Andrew Sterling, suffering the injustice of a racist police chief and neighbors in his new hometown.Nicolas Cage as the hard-luck patsy for the cops "spin control" caper. A down-to-Earth, down on his luck, functional illiterate, directionally handicapped, bumbling crook with a heart of tarnished silver.Dabney Coleman as the aforementioned racist police chief Cecil Tolliver; also running for county office. Stuck in a compromising position, trying his best to unravel the mess he's gotten himself into; all the while "fronting" for the Press as a good guy.Bob Balaban provides comical "comic relief" as the Hostage Negotiator Dr. R.A. Fink with a blast of his Bob Newhart-style telephone monologue.A surprisingly good movie from back in 1993.

Clarence Williams played a reprehensible scumbag on this one. I guess when you're not offered much in quality movies, you get what you can. John Glover's "Sport" was really annoying. But then again, it must've worked well, because I really hated him throughout the entire movie.The reviewers who think this was Roy Scheider's best performance, are nuts. What about "French Connection?" or "The Seven-Ups?" or even "Sorcerer?" This was not one of his best. This film was not "Ahead of its time" - it was a 1980's film; and looked it. Ann Margret relegated a part that could been played by any amateur, was also in need of a job and money to play in this stinker. But again, if you don't have studios calling for you as much as they were when you were young; this is what happens. (yeah, yeah - Grumpy Old Men 1983. Grumpier Old Men 1995)No thrills. No spills. "SPORT!"

Okay, so they get Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford to portray Russian Officers. I have to tell you that they may be Russians out there laughing at the accents used by the aforementioned actors. It was almost like listening to a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon with Boris Badenoff. I found it extremely difficult to take this movie seriously with Neeson and Ford rambling on in their choppy Russian.Sure, it was a serious drama and all that. But I just couldn't stop thinking about a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. Just typing this makes me laugh.

Would you believe there was time I thought Burt Reynolds was a good actor (Sharkey's Machine)? But even in "Deliverance" I didn't think he was that great. I just keep seeing him as "The Bandit" driving around, making an a** of himself, while being chased by Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). I also realize how bad an actress Catherine Deneuve was when I watched this flick. Beautiful and gorgeous, but terrible acting.Burt kinda' plays his old Dan August part in this movie. The interaction between Reynolds and Deneuve borders on hilarious; when they're trying to be serious. Seriously.It must have been that period of time when acting was different. Even Paul Winfield comes across like he's doing a reading at an audition. His scene with "The Albino" is terrible (i.e. stereotypically laughable).Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan contribute to this slow, laborious undertaking in establishing the plot. Ugh!

Emilio Estevez is almost as funny as his brother Charlie was in the "Hot Shots" series. Forget about SPOILERS! Who cares? Two of the funniest scenes for me was the interrogation of Miss Destiny Demeanor (Kathy Ireland) of the Sharon Stone - Basic Instinct parody. In which she continually crosses over her legs, while in a chair, with the attendant crowd of detectives sitting in "bleachers" waiting to catch a glimpse of her "you-know what." Finally, you see a beaver materialize in the style of a "Caddyshack Gopher."And then the shootout that York (Estevez) and Luger (Jackson) come upon while looking for a suspect; with the "Chips" guys, Ponch and John (who never pulled their guns out during the real show). The shootout is so loud and intense that Ponch has to shoot at John (narrowly missing him) just to get his attention.Too many sight gags to list, that'll bust you up. Funny, funny, movie with loads of cameo appearances.

Pacino and De Niro were perfectly cast for this movie. Jon Voight is the guy who gives De Niro and his crew "the scores." Pacino is the cop who tries to nail De Niro's kind before they can "take down scores." Great acting, great plot. Bad Guys vs. Good Guys. Bad Guys vs Bad Guys......The bank robbery shootout was a masterpiece. For once a movie portrayed the "professional bad guys" as actually knowing how to shoot. And boy, do they hand the cops their BEE-HINDS in their hats. They basically kicked cop-butt. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore join De Niro with their assault rifles in the mayhem they lay out on the streets of L.A. This is the kind of movie that's get cops wailing and whining that they're out-gunned in the streets, when in reality, all you gotta' do is to practice shooting your weapon, and lay off the freakin' donuts.William Fitchner plays a double-crossing bad guy who gets his just desserts toward the end of the movie. The scene where his men try and double-cross DeNiro's crew in the abandoned drive-in was just another example of the difference between the pro's and the amateurs.The dialogue between Pacino and De Niro in the restaurant should have been an "Oscar" winner.

After watching Peter Weller [act] in this movie, I can only imagine him mopping filthy johns at a two-bit diner now. Because I sure as heck would never give him a starring role in a movie again. After seeing this turkey roast after the first 15 minutes. Peter Weller sucked rotten eggs.The only reason(s) you'd watch this movie are: 1) Your Internet connection is down, 2) Your cable or satellite is out, 3) You don't have a date, 4) You've read all the best-sellers, 5) You're sick in bed, 6) You have bad taste in movies. or, 7) You were caught unawares that this flick has to be voted in the top 100 Worst Movies Ever.I couldn't believe the "romantic" interaction between Weller and that "Screamer" chick. You knew the film was already taking a dive when he saw the woman topless, bathing herself and he exclaims "God, you're beautiful." And when he kisses "it" after it saved his life, because "it" learned to LOVE, will make you laugh until you cry. Or split a gut.The freaking little nerd nubie soldier that tagged along with him was also a joke. And the resulting clash of the two "enemy" soldiers between themselves was predictable (One kills the other. Suspecting that he's a Screamer - he wasn't). As was the revealing truth of the remaining "enemy soldier" - he was a screamer. Wow, I'd have never guessed that in a million years.Most of the conversations between the "good guys" at the base were laughable. The director or the writer may have seen too many Star Wars movies. The Ewoks in the Star Wars movies acted better than anyone in this flop. The battle with the "Screamer Kids", who eventually get nuked; was hilarious.I think most of the people in the movie theaters who watched this, were the true "Screamers." Not in horror, but in anger. As in screaming "I Want My Money Back!"

That's right, Zuper! Zuper! Richard Gere was great as the manipulative, money-hungry, publicity-grabbing laywer Billy Flynn working to get Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) off of a murder charge. John C. Reilly's "Cellophane Man" was surprisingly entertaining. Along with of course, Richard Gere's great "puppet man" scene.But Zellweger really steals the show. Well, along with Zeta-Jones' super performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones with a real "triple-threat" performance (like that of Zellweger) really helped put this movie over the top. What a pair of bombshells. The Duo's closing number is awesome. Super choreography throughout the entire movie.

GENESIS: Goofy horror story of a statue of a sculptor's dead wife's statue bleeding and then the sculptor turning to stone, while she generates to flesh and bone. [...]I laughed at most of it; when I wasn't reading a book or surfing the NET. That's how bored I was. Honestly, after the first 5 minutes in the sculptor's shop, everything is predictable.AFTERMATH: Starts off with blood and viscera from a slaughtered dog. Bodies being "worked on" in a morgue (i.e. autopsy) by guys who looked like they enjoy their work. One guy takes the brain out of a body and then deposits it into the chest cavity of said deceased (is that SOP?). He then works on a female body and starts doing "his thing" after cutting her up. Pretty sick. I could go on and on. If you have a weak stomach, you'll probably barf. But I watched the entire process eating "Hamburger Helper" and it didn't faze me.

Since there were no Editorial Reviews, here's what the liner notes consisted of:In this album Stan introduced a sinewy new work for orchestra commissioned from a longtime associate, distinguished jazz composer-arranger Johnny Richards. "Adventures In Time, a Concerto for Orchestra" is a synthesis of eight original compositions by Richards that utilize the full resources of the Kenton musical organization. With this work, Richards once again demonstrates his flair for creating exciting and ingeniously constructed rhythm patterns - the same great gift that helped make "Kenton's West Side Story" a sensational bestseller and winner of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences award in 1962. Here he employs the unusual time signatures in a startling work that forcefully reaffirms the towering importance of the Kenton Orchestra as a seeker of new and challenging musical horizons.SAXOPHONESGabe Baltazar, alto (lead) - soloDon Menza, tenor - soloRay Florian, tenorAllan Beutler, baritone - soloJoel Kaye, bassTRUMPETSDalton Smith (lead)Gary SlavoBob BehrendtMarvin Stamm - soloKeith La MotteTROMBONESBob Fitzpatrick (lead) - soloNewell Bud Parker - soloTom RingoJim Amlotte (bass)MELLOPHONIUMSRay Starling (lead) - soloDwight CarverJoe BurnettLou GascaTUBADave WheelerBASSBucky CalabreseDRUMSDee BartonUTILITY PERCUSSIONSteve Dweck

I've loved this film since I was a kid. Always enjoyed it for what it was - A Film.Ever get the feeling that [some] of these "vets" commenting on films such as this, take them a little too seriously; or literally. It's as if they (the "vets") are trying to tell us that soldiers in combat (heavens-never a Marine) can never crack, quit or be cowards. Well, I guess they've never read books by real veterans who say that soldiers can go "wacko," "bonkers," and do stupid things to get themselves killed. New flash - They have in the past, and they will in the future. With all due respect, "Grunts" aren't the most intelligent people in the service - That's why they're "Ground-Pounders" Get real! Even you so-called "tough, macho men" out there, are human. I mean, really.This movie is a classic, for those who enjoy war movies. Robert Ryan (Lt. Benson) and Aldo Ray (Sgt. Montana) give First Class performances in this Anthony Mann film. The supporting cast of Robert Keith (Colonel), Nehemiah Persoff (Sgt. Lewis), Vic Morrow (Pvt. Zwickley) and James Edwards (Sgt. Killian) were excellent. You'll love this MOVIE.

Christian Bale (Jim Davis) is really psychotic in this movie. And he takes Freddy Rodriguez (Mike Alonzo) on this ride of deception, rip-offs, lies, self-indulgence and violence. Just when you think he's changing his ways, Davis sinks deeper into a morass that leads he and Mike to places and circumstances out of their control. Eva Longoria is the long-suffering Sylvia, Rodiguez's girlfriend who must put up with Mike and Jim's sick antics (mostly unbeknownst to her). The end wasn't shocking, but well expected, seeing the deadly path Bale was taking as the movie progressed. Bleak and pathetic existence of two friends, seemingly going nowhere but down.

There! Spoiler! Who cares. This business of not giving away spoilers is plain dumb. Anybody could IMDB or Wiki the darn plot.Rene Zellweger's is Emily, the Social Worker trying to save Lillith, the "poor kid" from her evil parents. The plot was predictable after the parents tried to "Roast" Lilli in the oven. I mean, come on, both parents trying to kill their child at the same time? Both psycho's? You knew the kid was going to start working on everyone involved in freeing her from her parents. You have had to be pretty dense not to figure out the kid was the evil one, and not the parents.She "kills" some boys parents (by phoning the boy to kill them) then Emily's psychiatrist friend Bradley Cooper, then her parents (mom burned, dad stabbed in mental institution), then the cop.....................do you see where this is going? The only way to kill Lilli is while she's sleeping. Anyway, Emily kills her in the end. Case 39 CLOSED. LOL!What a crock of *^>@#

The opening number of "Fuego Cubano" is just a portent of things to come. Absolutely beautiful orchestral arrangements for the Kenton band. These numbers showcase the powerful brass section, with the trombones especially coming to the fore (Bob Fitzpatrick, Carl Fontana, Kent Larsen).Marvelous solos by tenors Bill Perkins (La Guera Baila, Quien Sabe) and Lucky Thompson (Fuego Cubano), Trumpeters Vinnie Tano and Sam Noto and altoists Lennie Niehaus (La Suerte De Los Tontos, Recuerdos, El Congo Valiente) and the always exciting Gabe Baltazar (El Panzon, Wagon). All backed by an exceptional rhythm section to bring the listener into a wonderful world of Cuban rhythms.Johnny Richards was always a fantastic arranger for the Kenton Band. He had an absolute knack for employing the powerful forces of the brass section that spurred the band to greater heights on performances. And the Kenton band was never short of inventive soloists (as witnessed in this recording) to help interpret his marvelous compositions.

Ever since I saw Kim on "Austin City Limits" performing "I'm Alright" I can't stop listening to her beautiful voice. For me, Kim Richey can't go wrong, as I've enjoyed every one of her CD releases through the years. This is just another example of her great talent as a writer and a singer. Beautiful.

Did anyone beside me notice in the beginning of the movie, when Saiko (the FBI UC woman) blew away the bad guys, her semi-auto's slide never recoiled back? Okay, small detail. Did anyone notice Russell Crowe (Zack) using the same gun on the airliner that John Malkovich used, to attempt to assassinate the President in Clint Eastwood's film "In The Line Of Fire?"Well, gee, Helen Slater (she was Super Girl, remember?) was pretty entertaining as Mary, the airline stewardess/hostage. On the other hand, Crowe's superior (whoever she was) was one terrible actress. The Mob father; Serlano (Michael Lerner) of the son who was killed (scrotum and testicles no longer attached) by Saiko (who kills herself, soon after), kidnaps Crowe's son; Eric, until he brings the Yakuza dude - Yuji,(Etsushi Toyokawa) to him.Uh.. Crowe, the FBI guy, and the Yakuza dude go on a desert hike after the Yakuza dude hijacks the plane they're on, on their way to FBI headquarters....and uh, the bad guys take the Yakuza guy from Crowe in the desert and Helen Slater goes along for the ride. Never mind. The Mob lackeys are also low-class actors. I.....just don't know what to say about this movie. It was pretty bad. Oh, the desert showdown between the FBI guys, the Mob guys and the Yakuza helicopter dude; was pretty sad (as in pretty bad).Anyway, Yuji, Zack and Mary join forces to rub out Serlano and his flunkies in a trap to save Zack's son. There, I spoiled it for you. So the ending was good, but the movie as a whole, wasn't(?)All in all, I think Helen Slater was the star of the movie. She's a real jewel. (Her conversations with the cop in the car, and with bad guys at the lake are priceless). Maybe I'm wrong, but it's possible that this movie was supposed to be funny. FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT, PLEASE.

First of all, the tried-and-true method of the main character narrating as the story goes along, just didn't work with Casey Affleck's nasally and whiny voice. Maybe it was because Ben Affleck directing his brother Casey, thought it would work. It was more annoying and distracting instead of adding to the movie.Michelle Monaghan didn't play a very important or effective part. Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, was perfect as the "doper" and irresponsible mother who got her child back. Ed Harris as Detective Remy Bressant, was very convincing as the main cop and co-conspirator of the kidnapping. Morgan Freeman the mastermind and self-proclaimed "saviour" of the child of Helene McCready played a minor part until the very end.I'm glad this didn't turn out to be a movie that I'd need a calculator to rack up the body count. Although there was considerable amount of victims adding up (related and unrelated) after the initial kidnapping.And in the end, when Casey's character Patrick Kenzie has Morgan Freeman and the others arrested for kidnapping because "it was the right thing to do," he himself goes "Scot-free" after murdering (read Executing) a child molester and killer that the cops helped coverup since he tried to save the life of a cop shot at the very same crime scene. This self-righteous ending just didn't play into the message he wanted to convey. Sure, no one was going to miss the child molester/killer, but his summary execution was in step with that old saying of "the lesser of two evils." Pretty sour.Casey Affleck's tough-guy persona just didn't work in this movie. He just doesn't have that exterior gruff look or demeanor to portray a "bigger-than-life hero."

Wasn't sure what to make of this movie. What with the sinister plot hatched by Gary Sinise (Gabriel) and Charlize Theron (Ashley) using Ben Affleck (Rudy) as their pawn. And Rudy digging himself so much deeper into an inescapable dilemma, and also having to deal with the psychotic accomplices of Gabriel and Ashley. Especially the wacked-out "Merlin," played by Clarence Williams III, which hearkens one back to his equally psychotic character in Roy Scheider's 1986 movie: "52 Pick-Up."That Rudy was actually able to concoct a plan of escape (and revenge) in so short a time, with all the odds stacked against him; was a minor miracle. But then again, it's the movies. There were some lighthearted moments in the movie that also brought on some real comic relief; which also broke some of the tension from the psychotic behavior of Rudy's adversaries. The "Santa Claus Shootout," was actually an exciting and well choreographed segment. A very funny, yet rewarding ending.

Next to 'Saving Private Ryan' this is by far, the most combat-intensive movie I've ever seen. When the shooting starts, there's very little letup. Delta Sgt. 1st Class 'Hoot Gibson' (Eric Bana - Munich, Hulk, Lucky You, Troy) and Ranger 'SSgt. Matt Eversmann' (Josh Hartnett - Lucky Number Slevin, Sin City, The Black Dahlia) do "bang-up" jobs in this story of the bloody battle in "The Mog."Great contributions from William Fitchner (HEAT, Invasion, Prison Break, The Dark Knight) as Delta Sgt 1st Class Jeff Sanderson, Jason Isaacs (Resident Evil, Harry Potter, The State Within) as the by-the-book Ranger Capt. Mike Steele, and Tom Sizemore (HEAT, Saving Private Ryan, Bringing Out The Dead) as the rough and tough Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight.It never ceases to amaze me how so many foreign actors can easily imitate American accents in movies. Whereas, American actors hardly ever come through with convincing foreign accents. Case(s) in point: Ewan McGregor as Specialist Grimes, Jason Isaacs as Capt. Steele, Ewen Bremner as Spec. Sgt. Nelson, Orlando Bloom as Pvt. Todd Blackburn and Bana as Hoot. All handling their American accents with excellence during the entire movie. You just couldn't tell they are "foreigners."The detail of the weaponry used was good; especially the Black Hawks with mini-guns and the "Little Birds" with mini-guns and 7-shot rocket pods. With the excepting of one screen shot from above the "Little Bird" gunships, showing a Huey instead. A few other script continuity miscues, but mostly unnoticed by the technically deficient (for want of a more descriptive term). As previously mentioned, literally non-stop action of all the units involved in this undertaking.You'll notice future television stars such as Carmine Giovanazzo (CSI: NY) as Ranger Sgt. Goodale, Enrigue Murciano (Without A Trace) as Ranger Sgt. Ruiz and Nikolaj Coster Waldau (New Amsterdam) as Delta MSgt. Gary Gordon. And former T.V. star Ron Eldard (Men Behaving Badly) as CWO Mike Durant.

The story line? Who cares. Salma Hayek was sexy, alluring, beautiful and inviting in this movie. Oh, I'm sorry, Colin Farrell (Phone Booth, S.W.A.T., Minority Report, Daredevil, The Recruit, Miami Vice) as Arturo Bandini the hard luck novelist. Roller-coaster emotions for both the stars and a very sad ending. But there were some very touching scenes in between the fighting and lovey-dovey stuff. Nothing more to say but "Salma Hayek!" Oh Yeah.

What happened? Where you going? A gun? I'm gonna' call the Police. There's no news? There are people on top of that building. On and on... insipid dialogueREAD Wikipedia for the entire story. WHO CARES ABOUT SPOILERS?Military helicopters come in and insert squads of marines. Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to ride a helicopter to safety. Oliver and Candice still hide in the penthouse, but they are found. Candice accidentally exposes herself to the blue light and absorbed; Oliver sacrifices himself in an attempt to kill a machine, but does not succeed. The army is thrown off the roof by the aliens and one of the small machine / lifeforms attacks Jarrod and Elaine. Together, they kill it, but with Jarrod badly hurt, both are hopelessly trapped when the aliens have defeated the military and begin approaching them. Resigned to their fate, they look up into the blue light, embrace and are sucked up.The ending - Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. The movie ends with a series of still images between the credits that depict "Jarrod" protecting Elaine and their child from other aliens. Eventually "Jarrod" defeats them, picks his girlfriend up, and runs off with her.

You've got to have been in a coma for the past 30 years not to have seen this movie. Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, the "troubled" cab driver is awesome and scary. Jodie Foster (Iris) is alarmingly sexy, Cybill Shepherd (Betsy) is dreamy, and Harvey Keitel (Sport) is the evil pimp. The big shoot-out towards the end of the film is an unforgettable "classic." Tension-building direction from Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro - The Best.

Because of the fact that Dustin Hoffman plays the attorney for the Plaintiff in a wrongful death lawsuit (her husband, an attorney; Dylan McDermot - short cameo at beginning of movie) against a gun manufacturer; he does [mostly] everything by the book. So it's easy to somehow gloss over his character, since he comes across as the knight in shining armor for all the people who's loved ones have died due to handgun violence.Gene Hackman on the other hand, is the scheming, conniving, cold and calculating Rankin Fitch; the jury consultant for the gun manufacturer attorneys. It's easy for his character to be more dominating in the film, as he weaves some pretty evil, unscrupulous, coercive manipulations and intimidation of jury-influencing and tampering. And he has at his command, a plethora of seemingly callous "technicians" (automatons) to assist him. With one of his techs, a real scumbag, "get-it-done no matter what" type (i.e. via physical violence, if need be). Oh, he gets his just desserts from Wiesz (so I spoiled some of it - so what).All the while John Cusak as Juror #9; Nick Easter and his cohort in "jury-tampering" Rachel Wiesz; Marlee, worked their side in the manipulation (a.k.a Blackmail) of both the Plaintiff and Defendant attorneys to swing the verdict in one or the others favor (for money, of course). Cusak seemingly manipulates part of the jury, but in the end he knows that they'll decide on their on account. Nick, being on the inside, with the Jury. Marlee, on the outside working the attorneys.A surprise ending (though not really unpredictable), in which Hackman really gets it "stuck to him". He never knew what hit him. The real surprise is how Nick (Cusak) and Marlee (Weisz) screw Hackman (Fitch) while they come out smelling like roses (a little richer, and a little worse for wear) for their efforts; although still legally immoral. But not to them. They've played this game before.

I first saw this back in 1982. I could barely remember the story line. But after 10 minutes, the emotionally painful and sometimes grating scenes reminded me of this great movie. A great study of character acting. Fantastic performances by the entire cast. Not much more to add than has already been written by the numerous other reviews. Elizabeth Taylor was absolutely marvelous.

Yeah sure, aren't most sci-fi flicks weird? Okay, still a pretty good plot with exceptional acting from Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hathaway, who seemed a little like his Law & Order; CI character on the hunt for "Spence," played by Gary Sinise. I particularly liked the character of "Cale," played by Mekhi Phifer as the Mercenary who ended up helping Spence in his quest for the truth about himself; and got also the medical supplies needed for his "merc" colleagues in the process. Which in the end paid off for the mercenaries.

Yeah, love the San Francisco scenery because I lived and worked in The City for more than 30 years. But I digress. It never ceases to amaze me when people say they're going to give away "spoliers" or that they don't want to give away the ending. All you have to do is WIKI the darn movie. I think Glenn Close does a fantastic job along with Jeff Bridges.But truthfully, Bridges acting gives away the conclusion that he did it - around 40 minutes into the movie (if not sooner). Robert Loggia as the investigator for Close plays a somewhat stereotypical hard-nosed P.I. type that's a cliche. Peter Coyote is the usual D.A. - type with no surprises as to what all D.A.'s do in movies.

This is one of those movie series in which it becomes progressively worse with each installment. Not much I can say, but the women are atypical stereotypes of the aggressive females; long on angst and short on acting skills. Laughable plots and more laughable are the actors trying to reach out "acting". If you like sci-fi action flicks (there are boring sequences), this is pretty good. But don't ever expect Oscar performances in these movies. I guess no one really does.

Okay, so I don't understand the Coen brothers crap that they give to Hollywood. I still don't see why Tommy Lee Jones was even cast in this movie. Yeah, yeah....old men, times change, people change; and all that rubbish.The story was really about Josh Brolin (Llewelyn) who stumbles upon an a large amount of cash from an aborted drug deal gone bad between a bunch of dealers and buyers (everyone's dead on the scene, except one guy in a truck - he's later killed. But not by Brolin). And the Psycho killer, Anton (Javier Bardem) who goes around capping off people shooting bolts into their foreheads, or blowing them away with a suppressed shotgun (right) in his attempts to recover the cash that Llewelyn has taken. Anton acts like sort of an automaton throughout the movie. Sometimes flipping a coin to see if he'll take the life of his next victim (the victim is supposed to "call it". Uh-boy.Leewelyn's girlfriend, Carla Jean (played by Kelly MacDonald) was a really annoying stereotype of "trailer trash," with a double-digit I.Q. to boot. Seemingly spaced-out and unable to do any thinking on her own. Or maybe it was because she was so used to taking orders from Llewelyn (who cares).Woody Harrelson plays a short part (that's right, he gets blown away by Anton) hunting Anton and trying to get the money back from Llewelyn without really wanting to kill him.Tommy Lee Jones goes about the movie blabbering lines and contemplating this and that....oh my gosh, you really have to be into this existential garbage that the actors are attempting to convey to the audience. I got it - it was just plain stupid.The killer gets away in the next to the last scene. And then we see good 'ol Ed Tom who blathering to his wife about a dream. Oh, help me. I can see why it grossed ONLY $74 mil. With the exception of the shootout between Anton and Llewelyn - Bad movie. Lousy Movie.

Ummm, you people who think Mickey Rourke (Martin Fallon) was giving a great performance really need to watch more movies. Rourke's accent was almost as funny as Richard Gere's in "The Jackal." He was okay, but not great.Maybe this was a good movie in the 80's for that genre, but it was very slow, predictable and filled with stereotypical characterizations of cops and bad guys. Oh, the bad guys were especially terrible in this one (Alan Bates as Jack Meehan). Something like New York cops and bad guys; except Irish. The bumbling and fumbling cops weren't any better.Maybe it's because I like American-Made films better. Granted, that could be the problem with my somewhat biased opinion. But we all know that there have been countless American flops the past years.Then again, I've always admired Liam Neeson's (Liam Docherty) acting in any movie (A small part in this one, compared to Rourke's)- including "Next Of Kin," just two years after this one. Bob Hoskins (Father Da Costa) on the other hand, has never impressed me with his acting, and was especially terrible in "Enemy At The Gates" - (2001) as Nikita Kruschev; and in "Outlaw" - (2007) as inside police contact Walter Lewis.I'm still going to give it three stars for trying, and because there actually were parts I enjoyed once they picked up the pace (somewhat). Also, because when I think about it, so many American film makers could and have done worse (read "HITMAN" - Timothy Olyphant 2007).

Joe falls in love with a deaf, pretty drugstore clerk named Fon (Charlie Young), only for her to see him kill two street thugs....never mind.

I transcribed the entire sax solo of the Sun Suite back in 1978. So any alto players out there interested, email me. Just like "Images" the Sun Suite is the showcase alto sax piece. Beautiful soprano sax on Mimi (also transcribed) and great sax doubles/overdubs (a la Tom Scott) on Chelsea Bridge. I still have the original LP with all the liner notes, but just had to buy CD (which is way too expensive and cheap-looking).

Did anyone beside me notice that "Tales Of Rhoda Rat" is indeed Don Menza's "Time Out?" I have the original LP "Buddy Rich Plays and Plays" and this song is Menza's Time Out and not Mintzer's Tales of Rhoda Rat - As Mintzer's composition features a fast tempo in the style of "Two-Bass Hit" with no tempo changes.Other than that, Bob Kaye's composition; "Grand Concourse" featuring the alto sax of Andy Fusco is great. But please give a listen (and watch) to the Buddy Rich 1978 DVD Jazz Icons - Andy Fusco really blows a fantastic solo throughout.I also enjoyed Gary Pribek's tenor solo on "West Side Story", and of course, the Master; Buddy's extended solo. Bob Kaye'e piano is showcased on "Someday My Prince Will Come." Lots of screeching trumpets on "Bugle Call Rag" with Buddy's cool solo.

I won't bore you with the details. The story is kind of thin and predictable at times, but with enough foreshadowing, you see what's coming. The gratuitous scenes of Arnold getting the crap beaten of him (almost), leading up to the payoff conclusion, is great for those who hate seeing the hero take so long to exact revenge. In the end, the scumbag Columbian terrorist and his wife get their "just desserts." Ahhh...revenge is so sweet - Served up by our hero: The Governor of Kah-lee-fornya

.....from his penis; when it's chopped-off by a van window in [11:14]. Of course, he recovers in time to co-star in [3:10] to Yuma (hmmm...that time stamp again) with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale four years later.But that's only one part of a very cleverly-woven story of individual circumstances intertwined, resulting in the deaths of two people and involving at least a dozen other townsfolk. Great "backtracking" of each storyline that leads to the dramatic ending (or beginning).Does that make any sense? It will, after you watch this very cool movie that stars Patrick Swayze, Barbara Hershey, Hilary Swank, Shawn Hatosy (Alpha Dog, Outside Providence, The Faculty, In & Out), Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That, Josie and The Pussycats), Colin Hanks (Orange County, Band of Brothers, King Kong), Clark Gregg (The New Adventures Of Old Christine, Iron Man), and the aforementioned Ben Foster (and his penis).

I really liked the way this comedy hit you in subtle ways without trying too hard, and without continuous sight gags.Kelsey Grammer does an excellent job as the down-and-out Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge, of the low tech World War Two-era submarine USS Stingray; pitted against modern-day warships in a seemingly one-sided war game. Rob Schneider is the obnoxious and recalcitrant XO Martin Pascal. Lauren Holly is the untested, under pressure, Lt. Emily Lake. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern are the adversarial Admirals in the simulated war game.The crew is composed of a rabble of quirky, spaced-out, ill-mannered, insubordinate and mentally challenged sailors. When the chips are down, they transform into a well-oiled war machine, under Grammer's somewhat "unconventional tutelage." The XO "Walking The Plank" scene, and the Cook "passing gas" during silent running are two of the funniest.Living near San Francisco and being a WWII historian, I immediately recognized their submarine as the WWII U.S.S. Pampanito (SS-383) museum and memorial, docked at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. Another plus for you history buffs.Easy-going, relaxed, lighthearted comedy.

There's some pretty pathetic acting going on in this movie. Cuba Gooding was "under the radar" (i.e. over-acting). I can't even start to tell you how bad this movie is. The "Organization," "Mafia" actors or whatever you call to choose them, were stereotypical of lousy mob movies.Mathhew Modine wasn't very convincing, James Caan played his usual type character (i.e. nothing new) and Caan's daughter 'Clarissa' (Joey Lauren Adams) posessed this really squeaky-type annoying voice. Almost sounding like a parody of Lisa Simpson.The plot was far-fetched (A mob hitman suddenly trains overnight to become a stuntman. Yeah, right) and badly directed. I don't know what people see/saw in this movie as "action" - it wasn't. Good thing this movie wasn't widely released; it would have been mercilessly panned by the critics. All the actors must have been really "off their game" in this one.

The ending was so anti-climatic; because if you've seen these type of movies, you know what's going on, and what's going to happen.You see how Jeff Bridges is Professor Michael Faraday; being manipulated by the terrorists as he feeds off the death of his wife who was a Federal Agent who died in a shootout (a subtle reference to Randy Weaver family at Ruby Ridge); and his disdain for the Gov't not taking the blame for her death the deaths of others at an IRS building (another subtle reference: The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing). The terrorists put to good use, his paranoia, annoying and insipid behavior to paint a very unbecoming portrait of a man on the verge of the breaking point but, [above] suspicion.....until the end.There was nothing new about a plot of this type genre. Pieced together from so many other plots in the past. The ending was really hokey. I mean, really hokey. Timothy Robbins did an excellent job of the terrorist leader/architect and master manipulator Oliver Lang/William Fenimore.

With a few pages from the Rambo film "First Blood," Val Kilmer as ex-Marine and Gulf War veteran "Spooky" MacPherson arrives at the border town of New Lago, in search of his USMC buddy who needs help building his new home in the nearby town of New Hope. Kilmer gets rousted by the Sheriff and his gang of red-neck deputies employed by the megalomaniac John Rhodes (played by Gary Cole - Midnight Caller, Talladega Nights, In The Line Of Fire, Pineapple Express) of Halicorp (a not-so-subtle liberal shot at the Halliburton Corp.) who seems to own the town and its environs; and who also belong to the "United Borders" force (another not-to-subtle shot at the "Minutemen" organization).Anyway, to make a long story short. MacPherson is arrested, "washed down" (a la First Blood) and then the fun begins when the deputies assault him in his cell later that night. He of course escapes, kicking their butts in the process and then leads the bumbling red-necks on a car chase (he's in one of the deputies cars) which ends with him being shot over a small cliff. Oh, by the way, he suffers PTSD, which in a way, helps him survive and escape.Well, of course he survives (we later learn he was wearing the body armor of one of the deputies) to be rescued and put up in a small Mexican village by Joanna (Jennifer Esposito - Crash, Related, Samantha Who?) who has been taken care of by the evil Mr. Rhodes. She wants MacPherson to bring down Rhodes. After telling her he's not the man to do it, she shows him the video tape of his friend and families murder.After that, it's Hell on Earth for Rhodes and all his flunkies. Which concludes in an ambush, sniping and expertly aimed gunfire from semi-auto pistols by MacPherson with the help of one of the deputies (the one who shot him over the cliff) who just happened to be the brother of Joanna.Very predictable plot after the first 15 minutes. But still an enjoyable kick-butt movie. Don't take this movie seriously. Yes, there's a message about Red-Neck racism, Illegal Aliens, The Minutemen, and the Halliburton Corp. But hey, it's a movie, and whether you take offense to it or agree with its politicized message, don't let it spoil your enjoying this film.

Did someone say political thriller? Lopsided? Yes, it was lopsided. It lopped on the side of a slow crawl and boredom. I'm sure that's how the plot was mapped-out, a slow, deliberate pace to the conclusion. The funny thing was how short Matt Craven's part was, before he got blown away very early in the film, by Caine (Pierre Brossard) the French WWII Nazi Sympathizer. Tilda Swinton (Annemarie Livi) was very good as the judge, trying to get Brossard before the Jewish "hunters" rub him out.I guess I was looking for a little more excitement, but you can't expect that with Michael Caine now having reached the senior citizen level and moving at a snails pace. Even though he is fast on the draw - fast enough to blow away two "hunters" attempting to kill him.Charlotte Rampling makes a short cameo appearance as Caine's wife, Nicole. You may recogniza Ciaron Hinds as Pochon, the leader of the Nazi hunters, who also starred as Carl, in "Munich"

From the opening scenes of the doofus Air Force fighter pilot to the ditzy airline stewardess dropping the passengers food; you're in for a real treat of 1950's science fiction. Woooooooooo! Just listening to the opening commentary will have you on the floor. Wooooooo! The dramatic "flying saucer music" will make you so tense, you'll pass gas in fear. Wooooooo!Sit back and enjoy some terrible acting and really stupid-looking aliens. Woooooooooo! UFO's ! The Aliens have landed! Run for your freakin' 1950's lives. Woooooooo! Flying Dinner Plates! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $14 good-bye (average price for used DVD) with apologies to "Hardware Wars."Oh, and wait'll ya' see the Giant Cray Super Computers in the background! Whirrrr!

The opening sequence from raid ingress to egress, was intense, non-stop, violent and pulse-pounding. These troops were well-trained and executed their assignments perfectly. I had read the book prior to viewing this film and was greatly impressed by the complete battle sequences of the "Raid" (Americans) and the "Cover" (Filipinos) groups. Real heroes. Both inside and outside "The Wire."

What a great short movie by Morgan Freeman; an actor with no name, but "Did a film with Ashley Judd." He's doing research for an upcoming film project and starts off at a small grocery store (Jonah Hill - "The Kid" drops him off in his van) where he meets Paz Vega (Scarlet); who is beautifully cast as the disgruntled checker of a small grocery store.She reluctantly gives Freeman a ride home as she leaves work; because he forgot his phone number for his ride and "The Kid" fails to return to pick him up. They both end up on a days journey to an ex-husband's trailer park, a K-Mart, a fast-food restaurant, car wash, and eventually to her interview at a construction company for a job as a secretary (the scene between Freeman and the receptionist is hilarious).Freeman's behavior and interaction with other people and Scarlet is ethereal and esoteric, while Scarlet is quick-witted, smart-mouthed and down-to-earth. What a great pairing of actors. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman appear in a short but funny cameo towards the end.

I say "spoof" because this movie isn't to be taken seriously. It's a fun movie to watch Yun-Fat Chow; the Monk with no name, and Seann William Scott (Kar) interact. The old story of the teacher and the student of martial arts; only Kar learns his martial arts from the movies, at the movie theater in which he works. Mako makes a cameo appearance as his boss Mister Kojima, at the theater. This movie kind of reminds of Indiana Jones' "The Last Crusade," in which the Nazi (in this case - Karel Roden) tries to gain immortality. Karel Roden, cast as the aging Nazi Strucker, is mis-cast; as anyone can tell, his accent isn't even close to being German. Sounds too Russian. Despite that, he does okay as villian in this movie. Jaime King, plays Jade/Bad Girl is Kar's love interest, but kind of superfluous, even though she was the co-recipient of the scroll powers in the end. This was really more Seann William Scott's movie, than Chow Yun-Fat's.

Forget Spider-Man. Yeah, different genre, different period. Maguire gives us an outstanding performance as Jake Roedel, a bushwhacking marauder wreaking havoc on the Union Army during the Civil War. Skeet Ulrich as Jack Bull Chiles, Simon Baker as George Clyde and Jeffrey Wright as Daniel Holt are his close associates during most of the ride. With Jonathan Rhys Myers as Roedel's ally/nemesis, Pitt Mackerson; presenting a racist and very convincing neanderthal who just feeds on killing people.I won't go over the plot, which has been done for many reviews. But I must say that Jeffrey Wright gives an absolutely great performance in his role as George Clyde's sidekick/freed slave ("George Clyde's ni**er - what he was called in the movie) and then Jake Roedel's "riding buddy" (for want of a more descriptive term) to the end of the movie.Special note to Jim Caviezel as Black John, a psychopath killer and leader of men. Mostly bent on revenge for the deaths of women he knew. Remarkable and amazing performance by Jewel as Sue Lee Shelley, the twice widowed wife, and mother of Jack Bull Chiles baby. She comes across as demure, honest, low-keyed but still self-confident. Truly s surprise casting and very credible performance.Good detail of story line regarding the infamous Quantrill's Raiders. The ending scene with Daniel Holt and Jake Roedel was the most moving of the many moving scenes (as should be). Kudos to the composer of the ending music and the editor, plus ending theme by Jewel.

I love it when some reviewers state if you don't like this type of movie, it's because you have a short attention..............span, are not enlightened, or not sophisticated enough to understand or see things on their level of consciousness (or unconsciousness). When it all comes down to the fact that they don't understand quirky movies like this any more than you or I; but would never admit it to anyone. Deep down inside the 4 and 5 Star reviewers are asking themselves "what the hell was that all about?" Which just about sums it up for this movie. It was a bunch of c*r*a*p but I have to admit it was entertaining as a comedy (thus, the 2 Stars. It was a comedy, right?And I must stress that no matter how much a movie stinks, the actors still get paid for it. Even if the movie loses money. Wouldn't that be great if we all got raises in pay, even though we did a mediocre job in our yearly Performance Reviews? That's what kept me thinking "These people actually got paid for making this garbage!" What a great industry to work for. Lucky stiffs. What do I know.....I'm just an unsophisticated individual with a short..............................attention span.

A few favorites come to mind. Of course "We've Only Just Begun" and "Rainy Days and Mondays" were always my favorites from my high school days. But the real jewels were the songs I didn't really listen to until 20 years later. That's when I found "A Song For You" with Karen's beautiful and haunting vocal, and great tenor sax solo by Bob Messenger; which became one of my all-time favorite pop ballads. Prior to hearing this rendition, I had only heard Woody Herman's Thundering Herd play this on their Grammy Winning album "Giant Steps." I hadn't even heard of Leon Russell.But I must also add the wonderful "1980 MEDLEY - Sing/Knowing When To Leave/Make It Easy On Yourself/Someday/We've Only Just Begun", in which Richard orchestrated some beautiful string and woodwind movements. Especially on "Make It Easy On Yourself" - extremely lush string arrangement and first-rate vocal harmonies. Oh, but "Someday" stands out with the marvelous voicings of the strings, flute and oboe; plus the addition of the O.K. Chorale Singers (angelic choir-like voices) - WOW!. I almost lose it every time the singers come in. Thank you Richard, for writing some of the most brilliant string and woodwind accompaniments for Karen's "One-In-A-Million" voice.I'd be remiss, not to mention Richard's orchestrating great strings and woodwinds (first oboe, then flutes and clarinets) in "Where Do I Go From Here." Last, but not least (for me) - The happy, upbeat, Latin-tinged, "All You Get From Love Is A Love Song" showcasing the tenor saxophone of Tom Scott.I'm a woodwind and percussion player (and have always wanted to play the string family), so I sometimes lean on the side of listening to more the orchestrations than I do of the vocals of The Carpenters. Not to take away anything from the moving and beautiful voice of Karen, but I feel that Richard really complemented Karen greatly by writing so many wonderful string and woodwind passages in their music, to move the listener besides just Karen's voice. So I'm not going to apologize for overdoing the kudos on the orchestrations and not enough on Karen. Most all of the reviews have done the praising of Karen, so that should satisfy her fans. I (like the majority) loved and adored Karen Carpenter.

Everything about this phone is great with me. Especially the PDA functions, Camera and Video. I use an SD card to store the pics from the camera and videos from the camcorder. Sure, they aren't high quality, but they work good enough that I don't have to carry a digital camera or camcorder around with me. Messaging, Blue Tooth have always worked great. I especially like the assorted ring/alarm tones.The nice thing about this phone is that it's much more compact than the Tungsten models I've owned the past years, plus the additional features the Tngstens don't have. I've been so impressed that I'm moving up to the 700p next.

David Caruso, as Jimmy Kilmartin; ex-hood, ex-felon was great. Showing that post-"NYPD" and pre-"CSI: Miami" demeanor. All the while being pushed around by the cops (Samuel L. Jackson as Calvin), almost killed by "Little Junior - B.A.D.," played by Nicolas Cage; psycho-hood son of father gangster "Big Junior" (what else!) played by Philip Baker Hall.Jimmy goes to prison, but before he's released 3 years later; his wife (Helen Hunt) is run over (in a drunken stupor). Then, his cousin is killed by Cage for screwing up. Jimmy ends up marrying Rosie, played by Kathryn Erbe in her pre-"Law And Order - Criminal Intent" days. She's a real "looker" in this one.An undercover fed (Ving Rhames) whom Jimmy meets, is assassinated by Little Junior, in his presence. The Feds want Junior's hide, but he ends up "walking." If you've watched a lot of movies with state and federal authorities screwing each other and not sharing information (Stanley Tucci - the prosecutor, among the many), then you'll know why Cage walks.This is going to take too long, so please read "long-winded" reviews for complete storyline.Anyway, the movie is short enough but replete with the many cliche'd "good guys vs. bad guys" mannerisms and confrontations that have been overdone in so many movies that... well....they're done in this one.

Wow, this was one terrible movie. The gratuitous violence during the car chase was absolutely over-done. The shady characters were typical stereotype thugs. Travolta just was as bad (acting-wise) as he was in The Punisher. In fact, almost a cliche'd carbon-copy.Yeah, yeah, Halle Berry showed her great body to the detriment of some really sorry lines.Hugh Jackman - well I guess I couldn't get past Wolverine hacking into computer networks. The only time I paid any attention to Jackman was when he mentioned the DEC PDP-11; because I used to run that computer in the early 80's.Oh, and Sam Shepard, who played the Senator, really needs to change his one-dimensional characters he portrays in nearly every movie I've seen him in.Bad, bad movie, with too many predictable scenes. But these actors got paid, and that's all that really mattered. Heck, If I got paid for doing a lousy job at work, I [probably] wouldn't care either.....then again maybe NOT.

Can't remember seeing a more atrocious example of acting since Cuba Gooding's Direct-to-DVD releases.The producer and director must have recruited every podunk, no-talent actor from the backwaters of "Trailer-Trash U.S.A." You do not want to watch any further than the first 10 minutes. Honestly, there are better amateur production "shorts" by high school and college-age students on YouTube than this crap.As always, in the early years of "cult classics" the acting by the majority of players is nauseating; as they seem to be reading lines from queue cards off the set. This will appeal to those followers of cult films only for the hilarious example of what bad acting and directing can produce. GARBAGE!

Exceptional support from John Tuturro, Famke Janssen (gorgeous), Gretchen Mol (beautiful) and especially John Malkovich as Teddy KGB: "He beet me, street up. peyee thet main his myknee." Fantastic script and direction, in terms of pacing, tension and drama. One of my all-time favorite movies of Matt Damon and Edward Norton.

Steve Carrell (Dan Burns) played too much of Michael Scott in this one. It was like THE OFFICE in a family setting. Dane Cook didn't really add much to the casting. And Juliette Binoche (Marie), unlike Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell has yet to master an American accent to be believable, much less intelligible, with her natural accent fading in and out.Pretty sappy premise and very predictable circumstances. Especially with Dan's daughter's dispositions. And the music of Sondre Lerche playing in and out of scenes was really annoying. Their music was fitting at the end but was overdone during the movie.

I believe this is [the] bottom of the barrel performance of Keitel's life. The story was stilted, disjointed and incoherent. Maybe it was meant to be that way, but it was a dumb movie, altogether. I won't waste my time detailing the premise of the story, but there are parts that will make you laugh out loud - the car scene with the two young girls that Keitel "gets his rocks off" (literally), that's absolutely hilarious. I really don't feel that this movie was meant to be serious, because it was too far out there. It's possible that the drug-induced scenes were real, because Harvey Keitel had to have been on drugs to perform the way he did in this film. The Director must've been on drugs when he made this movie....honestly.

When couples start growing apart. Your girlfriend Alex, who is supposed to be finishing up her dissertation on fruit flies having sex (Kate Beckinsale) ends up making out with your Mom; Jane (Frances McDormand) a record producer and her rockstar boyfriend. Sam (Christian Bale) Kate's boyfriend; is a psychiatrist working with Sara (Natasha McElhone), and they're attracted to each other. Does any of this make sense?The uptight student delays her dissertation, starts smoking grass and hanging with a bunch of lousy rockers and Christian Bale's Mom and boyfriend. Then the two psychiatrists get drunk, kiss and don't do it.We go back to the studio (after Frances McDormand tells her boyfriend she liked kissing her son's girlfriend), which is in the house. Uh, well then the stoner alcohol-guzzling rockers go to a party, then Bale and McElhone sit in car taking about how each other would taste during sex. Still don't do it because Sam feels guilty, but Sara doesn't. In fact Sara just wants to have sex with Sam with no attachments.I think this Lauren Canyon thing has to do with the book I read about Joni Mitchell, the Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, groupies, etc., living in that neighborhood. Pffft! This movie turns very predictable after 60 minutes. I don't know why I even wasted time doing this. You won't find this helpful at all.

Of course this movie will appeal to those certain ethereal space-cadets that sit around drinking brandy and pondering the existential mind of the rat. You know something's afoot, when you enter a Convent with an upside-down Pentagram on the wall and the Munsters Uncle Fester (Baltazar) and Rosie O'Donnell (Berta) greet you. Even creepier is the super-freaky Baltar who immediately has a "woody" for Deneuve, and doesn't hide that fact that he's gone Ga-Ga over her; probably from the lack of women around the joint.There are these comical musical moments as Malkovich (Professor Michael Padovic) and Deneuve (Helen) approach the caves (chapels). I mean, really something out of Scooby-Doo. A particularly funny scene is when Baltazar (the lackey) recoils away from a cave and says with his back to the visitors "This....is....the last....of the chapels" What the heck? The introduction of Piedade (chick) does not bode well for Malkovich. She looks like a very happy, smiling "serial-killer."There's the door-slamming scene between Michael and Helen which is also funny. It'll remind you of a guy watching ESPN or playing and video game; completely ignoring his wife who's trying to get his attention. You guys out there know what I'm talkin' 'bout.Strange, freaky movie that you'll enjoy with a bunch of guys getting drunk on non-alcoholic beer. Yes, we who don't understand such films are fools. But we don't walk around with our panties in a bind.

Yeah, yeah - What is that supposed to mean? I honestly love this bad movie. Just because Bruce Dern has these terrible lines like "Cowboy, Desperado" that he [aims] at Ryan O'Neal, "The Driver" - who is hired out by bad guys for getaways from crime scenes (guess that goes without saying).The plot was really far-fetched. I mean a cop making a deal with bad guys (three real bumbling clowns) to rob a bank so that he can catch "Driver" - Ryan O'Neal. But darn it, the hokey lines that Bruce Dern exchanges with one of his "understudy's" (Matt Clark) and O'Neal are really outrageous.I must add that the car chases were NOT that great. Really. Nothing can compare to "Bullitt." Even "The Seven-Ups" car chase was better than the ones in this movie.Again, I must say that only for the acting of Bruce Dern, this movie would fall flat on its face. Isabelle Adjani really brings home some dead-pan acting. Absolutely emotionless. And Ryan O'Neal's acting isn't much more emotional, either. But all this adds up to a really cool movie. Why? I still don't know.

Mark Wahlberg was great. The plot was far-fetched. Danny Glover is absolutely obnoxious with those braces on, and mis-cast as the bad-guy heavy (unbeknownst to Wahlberg). The technical jargon for snipers was very real and accurate. If you can ignore Glover in this, it's pretty entertaining despite the aforementioned far-fetched plot. Still a very good action movie with lots of shooting.

From the amateurish opening scene car chase, with Seagal's chubby mug filling the entire screen (and the green screen backgrounds from the car) to the really hokey ending - ugh!The budget was very low, as the special effects of Seagal shooting down a helicopter gunship with his .45 really sucked And the insipid Kung-fooey school of students. Just can't say enough for this bad movie.I think he has a double standing in some scenes showing him in the shadows or of his back (as in Belly Of The Beast) because he's really put on some oink-oink pounds. And he has terrible pancake make-up applied to his aging mug. Plus, his over-dyed black hair with out-of-style ponytail makes him look like a clown.

A surprisingly good performance by Chris Evans (Ryan), who's the somewhat dorky, macho dude; against the convincingly evil, badman kidnapper, Jason Statham (Ethan). Kim Basinger plays Jessica Martin; a panicked, desperate, tortured, but determined and very ingenious wife of the hunted husband. She also comes up in the clutch as the movie progresses.The action is fast and sometimes hilarious, with Evans doing the footwork (via his cell phone) in various impossible situations trying to help Basinger (especially when he needs to recharge his phone - a real doozy of a scene). William Macy is Detective Mooney, who eventually puts the pieces of the puzzle together while Ryan (Evans) traverses all over town creating mayhem all his own, while attempting to foil the kidnappers.Good acting (and action) by Chris Evans, with able support from Basinger, Macy and Statham. A surprisingly entertaining movie.

You'll be shaking your head and laughing at this one. First thing you'll notice is the overblown amateur acting of these college students. I mean, really amateurish and predictable. The shaky camera didn't bother me, as it was meant to look like an original "on-location" documentary of mindless, insipid, post-high school morons. Reminds one of party-hardy types who need to drink in order to be social and obnoxious at the same time (we've all been around these type idiots).Again, very amateurish filming and directing of airhead yuppie college half-wits. After the first 12 minutes of the film, you really want the "Monster" (and its little babies) to start wiping out these useless denizens of endless partying. Well, in a fun sort of way. The only tension in the movie is watching these kids partying, and conversing in the usual tripe one engages in with a bunch of drunks. Who by the way, miraculously sober up when the monsters attack (or maybe not).The release of tension from watching these social drunkards is relieved once the loveable monsters begin their mayhem of the city. Of course, the real worth of these "ne're do wells" in panic and disaster situations is revealed by their absolutely stupified reactions to imminent death. Rob! Rob! ..... Hud! Hud! .....Oh my God! Oh God! ......Hey Dude!Laughingly entertaining. Not scary at all. At 27 minutes into the movie, you'll be chuckling. At 60 minutes, really laughing! At 70 minutes, you'll be rooting for the monsters! At 73 mins, 34 secs. your pain will subside. Documentary over. "It's a wrap!"

It's true that they don't make music like this anymore, and probably won't again. But that doesn't mean we can't still enjoy great music, such as presented in this CD. These talented singers were truly blessed with wonderful voices to harmonize as one.One should listen especially to "Till The World Ends" to realize the beautiful background chords that accompany the entrancing vocalization of Chuck Negron on this marvelous tune. One of TDN's most beautiful and more deserving of wider recognition.From the shouting, hard-driving choruses of "Eli's Coming," "Celebrate" and "One," to the soothing melodies of "Out In The Country" and "Easy To Be Hard", this compilation showcases the writing and singing talents of this great 60'sand 70's super group. All unforgettable songs from the past, to be enjoyed in the present.

Another great offering from Sergio Mendes. The band is really swinging on tunes like the upbeat "Funny You Should Say That" (fantastic guitar work and great horn arrangement). Stevie Wonder's "If You Really Love Me" (angelic harmonies from the two beauties - Bonnie and Gracinha. Plus wonderful flute, alto sax and string voicings) "This Masquerade" featuring Bonnie Bowden's soft, sexy voice, "Voce Abousou" (the whole gang). "Waiting For Love" is surprising beautiful. What a great album that I remember from the 70's; along with the albums "LOVE MUSIC" and "HOME COOKING." What a treasure that Brasil has given us in Sergios Mendes and all his bands, through the years.

I first heard "Love Music" on an AM radio station while still in high school and was blown away. I quickly became a Sergio Mendes fan soon after. The beautiful voices of both Bonnie Bowden and Gracinha Leporace are a real treat to this album. The exciting beat and lyrics to "Love Music" are irresistible. I love Bonnie's singing on "Put A Little Love Away. But my absolute favorite from this album is "Hey Look At The Sun" - beautiful flute and string arrangement behind the dreamy voices of the two females. I always played this song when I did some long-distance driving.

I remember reading someone saying that the plot was muddled. It was. The ending was one of the worse I've seen in movies. I expected Sean Bean and his compatriots to get even, but all they did was get their as**** kicked by the Gov't. I mean, just when you think his little army of misfits are going to complete what they set out to do; they bollix (or bollox) it up.Even Bob Hoskins part in helping out the "vigilantes" was predictable and so bad you knew when "his time was up." Bad script and bad direction.

Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years; including some pretty esoteric stuff (Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang - Wonder Boys - Tropic Thunder) but he sometimes borders on the outrageous here as Tony Stark - In a good way. His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah "Stane" (was that a subtle hint?) and the "Iron Monger" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's "Hulk" vs. Tim Roth's "Abomination" battles.

The plot leads one to think that McAdams as Lisa can't handle the pressure or control the situation brought upon by the smooth-talking terrorist Jack Rippner (played by Cillian Murphy). You get the feeling she's going to be one of those hysterical female types, intimidated by a terrorist. Rippner uses both mental and physical abuse during the flight back home, to get Lisa to switch hotel rooms of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (using her Management Power and Authority) so that his cohorts get a good target to hit. Brian Cox plays Lisa's Dad, who is the unsuspecting hostage that will be killed unless Lisa complies to Rippner's demands.Ah.. but, Lisa ends up kicking butt. She first performs an unscheduled "trachaeotomy" on Rippner with a pen (i.e. stabs him in the throat), and then escapes just as the plane lands. She then proceeds to steal an SUV from the "Departing Flights" drop-off area and uses it to smash into and send the would-be assassin of her Dad through the front doors of the house. And finally, as Rippner catches up to her at the house; takes him for a tour of the house (a la hide-and-seek) before she and daddy put a couple of holes in him.Jayma Mays plays Cynthia, Lisa's co-worker and front desk agent at the hotel. She lacks confidence, is not very well organized and space-out to a point of being annoying. But she, like Lisa is able to "keep cool" when the chips are down, and ends up being a life-saver in the end. She really turns out to be quite cute with her lines. Especially her ending line in the movie. SURPRISINGLY GOOD MOVIE.

Wouldn't have been complete without the gorgeous Rachel Weisz. Edward Burns; as Jake Vig, the master grifter narrates throughout the movie, setting up the "scam to scam the bad guys"(?) His crew includes Paul Giamatti as Gordo, and Brian Van Holt as Miles with a few surprise "team members" (Franky G as Lupus is one) that you may or may not catch on to.Anyway, Dustin Hoffman plays a pretty weird guy named "The King," with some really kinky habits. The story follows the big con setup that Jake has to pull off for The King (to make up for ripping him off) on a crooked banker named "Morgan Price." The story line is a con in itself, and you need to be on top of things to piece it together before it "goes down". But maybe I'm telling you too much (spoiler?). I really enjoyed the movie after a somewhat tedious beginning.

At least that's what I think. This movie is really quirky, and I love the performances of Mark Wahlberg as the fireman Tommy Corn, Naomi Watts as the Huckabees (Fu**abees!) model Dawn Campbell ("Looks like an Amish bag lady") and Jude Law as Brad Stand. Jason Schwartzman as the metaphysically troubled Albert Markovski, really delivers in his quest for answers to his existence.The interaction between Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin (the Existential Detectives) and their patients is marvelous. The snappy dialogue is really amazing; especially when you think about the timing involved to make the scenes funny. All the actors are on top of their game. Great "existential" comedy - ethereally speaking. I never tire of this movie. Shania Twain makes a short but funny cameo appearance (has to do with an ongoing joke).

And I thought Season 6 was great! One of my favorite episodes in this set here is when Doug has to work in the Chinese restaurant that he's renting an apartment above (Apartment Complex). This guy is so funny. Kevin James is ten times funnier than Ray Romano, and TKOQ is ten times funnier than "Everybody Loves Raymond." Whereas, Raymond is a cowering p-whipped coward in most anything he does; at least Doug has a personality and actually stands up to Carrie (most of the time). And Doug has real class when he takes care of a baby, to prove to Carrie that he can be a great father. Very touching moments in the episode "Fresh Brood".Yes, these are the episodes where Carrie is chubby from pregnancy, but Leah Remini has been and still is beautiful. Carrie complements Doug so much with her rough and tough talk. She and Kirstie Alley are particularly hilarious in their segment of the aforementioned episode "Apartment Complex." And Carrie's episode involving the iPod she doesn't pay for feaking funny (Ice Cubed).What a great season to a superior comedy series. Just thinking of Doug's misadventures, cracks me up!

Marisa Tomei, as the reporter Natalie Hegelhuzen was pretty hot in this movie. Hilary Duff was very good, as the irrepressible Yonika Babyyeah; the spaced-out, bitchy, one-dimensional, come-on sex-kitten, bimbo; who turns out to be the long lost daughter of Hauser (Cusak). Joan Cusak was particularly annoying and obnoxious as Hauser's Admin Assistant. Cusak had some great fight sequences in which he kicks butt. Well, kills butt. Really funny story line and hilarious circumstances that involve the characters in compromising situations. Really enjoyed the interaction between Cusak and Tomei. Dan Aykroyd's part really wasn't that funny; or needed.

There are far superior movies that don't have to do with the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, than this puker (e.g. The Best Years Of Our Lives). They carry the same message of coming home from war better than this one [tried]. Oh, Samuel L. Jackson was pretty bad, as was Jessica Biel. 50 cent acting "ain't worth a plug nickel" (thought I'd throw that in) even if he got acting lessons from the late Lee Strasberg or Ice Cube (who isn't all that great, himself), it wouldn't help. But when I see 139 of these DVD's on sale for .75 on Amazon, that about sez it all. You'll be part of "The Home Of The Brave" if you buy this stinker. Waste of time and money.

I'm not referring to either Karl Malden or Michael Douglas, but oh gawd the rest of the cast(s) were absolutely atrocious. I was always an avid fan of this series and of the reruns. The big difference in crime dramas like this from the "olden days" and those of today is the "evolution" of good acting from guest stars and extras. So many of the episodes in this series had laughable police procedures and acting from fellow officers and guest stars. Compared to series like Law and Order, The Shield, CSI, NCIS, Southland and even The Closer, this series would be close to the bottom of the barrel; as far as acting is concerned.Some prime BAD examples: (1) Cops draw their guns with their fingers on the trigger, instead of outside the trigger guard; even if there's another cop directly in front of them. (2) When they shoot a suspect, they run to him/her and take the gun and hold the wound with one hand, while the gun is still on the other; no handcuffing suspects even after they're shot (and a known killer). (3) The comical way they answer radio calls, as if they're talking to one another in the office. (4) One of my favorites - shooting door locks; not expecting anyone to be behind the door (especially an innocent); or ricochet's. (5) Arriving at a gun battle and just joining in by opening up on buildings where the bad guy(s) are holed up and not worrying about civilians in the adjoining houses or apartments. (6) And of course, the greatest of all - the warning shot into the air - no worries about where that bullet is going to land when it comes down (people do get killed that way). Those are some of the reasons I can't give it 5 Stars.I no longer see this show as a truly serious crime drama. Very few episodes were touching or "tear-jerkers" unlike a lot of today's shows. But I still enjoy it most because of the locations where I've been and where I've lived in either 'The City" or Daly City.

STOP SCREAMING ! Okay, this has got to be one of THE grossest movies I've ever seen. Radha Mitchell screams and shouts enough times in this flick for 10 horror movies. Great special effects, and that dude with the GIGANTIC knife was pretty darn scary. If this movie was based on a video game, I'd hate to play that game. And I thought watching my son playing "Bioshock" was scary.Great film adaption, script writing, acting, direction and special effects. Radha Mitchell's performance is on par with her part in Vin Diesel's "Pitch Black" (and she was good in Pitch Black). I just voted this movie as one of my all-time favorite horror flicks (SE7EN, Silence of the Lambs, etc). Very cool. Geez, I hope I never hear another air-raid siren again.

At the conclusion of this movie, I was thinking to myself... what the? I don't know where to start, but some of the camera work early in parts of the movie where terrible; with camera angles changing every two seconds or so, making it extremely difficult to follow the action. The peculiar mannerisms of Aurora (Melanie Thierry) were maddening to the point that you wished Vin Diesel, as Toorop or Michelle Yeoh, as Sister Rebekah would put some tape over her mouth to shut her up. Speaking of Michelle Yeoh. She was mis-cast in this thing of a movie. Terrible job on her part. She may have been added only to spice up the action scenes with her Martial Arts. Other than that, she wasn't very interesting. And Gerard Depardieu's part was useless and laughable. I can't be subjective about a movie that was too fragmented to make any sense. Ugh.

I enjoyed every loud, gunfire-blasting moment of this movie. Paul Giamatti (Mr. Hertz) is an evil, foul-mouthed crack-up, occasionally on the phone with his wife during gun battles. A perfect foil to Clive Owen's (Mr Smith) dark, gun-toting, sure-fire bad-guy killing demeanor. Monica Bellucci as Donna Quintano, the prostitute is as beautiful as ever. A myriad of predictable shootout chiche's as you'll ever see in a movie. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.

When you watch the opening scenes of these bogus scientists (Matthew Marsden is one of them) who have no idea of what they're talking about, you'll know that whoever put this together was on a limited budget and had to deal with actors who seemed like they were reading off a script. The "Guide" (Johnny Messner) was your stereotypical tough-talking macho jerk......anyway, the lines these people spout out are from so many bad "adventure/horror films" of the past. He even wrestles and alligator...or was it a crocodile?You may not be able to get past the initial scenes of these "clowns" heading up or down river; especially when mister boat captain has his stupid little monkey on his shoulder.To save you the misery of watching this bit of tripe, just imagine some low-quality actors hired to do their first and possibly last movie (with the exception of Messner - "Running Scared"). Then you'll understand why 213 these DVD's are selling for $0.01 - can't get rid of this movie fast enough."Anaconda" and "Snakes On A Plane" were more entertaining than this "mirror." I say mirror, because if you buy this DVD, that's all the use you'll be getting from it. Hope you make it through this movie. I lasted only 32 minutes before I went off and did something more constructive with my life. I finished watching it when I got the flu, and was totally nauseated - kind of went with the movie.

How do you like my alliteration? Two brothers, Hank (Ethan Hawke) and Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sink to new lows trying to ripoff their own parents jewelry store (and fence "the goods") to pay off debts and start new lives; from their completely screw-up ones.The story was tedious but extremely tense and nerve-wracking once the plan unravelled and "went completely south," as Hawke's accomplice shoots his Mom (she in turn kills him during the robbery attempt). She's taken off life support soon after. Then, it's their Dad, Charles (Albert Finney), who's on a relentless hunt to find out who the accomplices were. It's a predictable and tragic ending for all families. Not a happy ending.

Coogan's search and apprehension of the miscreant Ringerman (Don Stroud) from Arizona to New York City is at times comical. Deputy Sheriff Coogan seems to have little scruples doing his job; lacks finesse, patience, social graces and is a bit misogynistic. But then again he is "rough around the edges" - and I do mean rough. He treats his prisoner (Ringerman) and any "accessory" like a disgruntled UPS package handler.Susan Clark as Julie Roth tries to even out those rough edges, but to no avail. Coogan gets his man, but not after leaving New York like "Jaws" left Quint's boat in the final act of that movie. Okay, maybe not that bad. Don Stroud did a great job as the fugitive scumbag, Ringerman.

Carlos and Jessie made this "slow mover" an absolute stinker. I hated this amateur effort so much, that I don't want to elaborate. Normally, I'd give away spoilers for a movie that sucked as much as this; but it's not worth the effort.

A few of the questionable tactics used in apprehending or pursuing guides, smugglers, illegals or armed-adversaries:They serve a warrant on a suspected smuggler's house, yet they don't have a battering ram or even a hooligan tool to breach the door. One of the guys tries to bash through, slamming his shoulder onto it; after the rake they found (unbelievable) couldn't jimmy the door open.Two agents patrolling a dangerous area where there's the possibility they might encounter heavily-armed men, who would outnumber and outgun them, carry only 20-round mags in their M4's or only one of the two is armed with an assault rifle.A night raid at a crossing point, trying to catch illegals with the help of a helicopter overhead with FLIR, is wrought with confusion as the chopper pilots can't differentiate the illegals and the pursuing officers. This could have been easily solved if the officers each had an infra-red strobe attached to the back of their web-gear or assault vests; making for quick identification.So is it a matter of money and training? Money has to be one, when you see these older civilians decked out in Digital Camo uniforms, policing their own property (in camo jeeps and trucks at night) due to the damage the illegals cause, crossing their farms in the process of getting into the cities. Not enough agents to cover all the areas.The irony of the whole "War On Drugs" is the that Americans are the biggest consumers of illegal drugs than any country in the world. So it's really the fault (read DEMAND) of the millions of Americans, who's voracious appetite for these drugs is the only reason the "Supply" is met by the drug cartels from the South. The drug cartels wouldn't exist were it not for us here in the United States. Somehow, the Border Patrol agents really don't give a crap about the education of drug use, just their job of catching the supplies (as it should be).It's an unwritten rule (I guess) that in order to become an effective agent, you must harden yourself, to the point of unfeeling (for want of a more descriptive term) for the sad and sometimes tragic stories of the illegal immigrants. And there are some really heart-breaking stories - Like the mother and her daughter (less than 10 yrs old) who were abandoned by their "guide" and ended up walking more than 20 miles on their own, with the daughter fainting due to an asthma attack. They could barely walk when captured by CBP Agents. And all the stories of illegals caught after spending thousands of dollars to their smugglers; only to get caught. The majority of them (yes, there a still a lot who are criminals and drug runners) who only seek a better life here in the U.S. despite the illegality of it all.Still, it is a very good documentary of the daily activity down at the border by another branch of Homeland Security.

Harvey Keitel (Roy) plays his usual self-assured character leading a group in a jewelry heist, and then goes up against a myriad of contract killers.Famke Janssen is very convincing as a mother of two and wife of one the jewelry heist gangmembers who gets caught up in the mess. Famke is very attractive with or without makeup, (and very tall-with those long legs). Timothy Hutton, Roy's brother (killed off early by Dorff) and Lucy Liu have minor parts.All I can say is you'll be so very happy when Harvey Keitel smears Stephen Dorff's brains all over the pavement, towards the end of the movie. Stephen Dorff gives and absolutely first-class perfomance of a double-crossing, short-tempered, quick-drawing psychopath, who won't be double-crossed (as he has double-crossed) by anyone. Why does Harvey Keitel always seem like that "cleaner-upper" character in Pulp Fiction? You'll love the lawyer's office "laptop computer" scene. Classic.

So the story may have been pure fantasy and an improbable one at that - so what. I really enjoyed Viggo Mortensen as the "cowboy" Frank T. Hopkins in a tale about as believable as George W. Bush having a 100% approval rating. Hopkins and Hidalgo coming through the race after all the hardships, ambushes and psychological hurdles was predictable, yet satisfying.Omar Sharif was barely recognizable to me, but still played his part as Sheikh Riyadh in extreme stereotypical fashion. I always enjoy watching Said Taghmaoui (Three Kings, Traitor, LOST) who played Prince Bin al Reeh riding the biggest competitor to Hidalgo. I was surprised to see Louise Lombard as I've only recognized her as Sofia Curtis on CSI (and the upcoming series NCIS:Legend). She did a tremendous job as the scheming "win-at-all-costs" Lady Davenport. Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Daughter of the Sheikh, played a very predictable and stereotypical part, but was very good, nonetheless.The interaction between Frank Hopkins and Hidalgo was a little sappy, but still lent itself to the premise of the film. Great cinematography with the breathtaking scenery of the "desert race." A really cool movie.

I really didn't expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed so much. Somewhat of a low-budget film, that didn't really need all the advanced FX they use nowadays.What really surprised me was that this movie was made back in 1996. I could tell from the background skyscrapers in L.A. with the First Interstate Bank building - Only because I was working at Wells Fargo Bank, and we had a "Hostile Takeover" of that bank in 1996. So that First Interstate logo would soon be a memory before the year was over.Josh Charles was pretty average in your average film; which made it all the more enjoyable. He's not the super hero type. And Rutger Hauer, a little overweight from his 'Blade Runner' and Night Hawks' days, was the somewhat bumbling leader of the trio. Andrea Roth sort of reminded me of Christina Applegate. Not much more to say. A fun and simply weird science fiction adventure.

I'M YOUR SECRETARY! I'M YOUR SECRETARY! Punishingly funny. Sick, disturbing, entertainingly silly comedy. From subtle, to heavy-handed, to unpredictable.You're not sure if you want to like, hate, or pity the main characters; Mr Grey (James Spader - Stargate, The Practice, Boston Legal) or Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal - Donnie Darko, The Dark Knight). But there are some outrageous scenes that make up for the somewhat (ahem) sick sexual practices that the boss and secretary go through.Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan, Solaris, Rescue Dawn), as Lee's spaced-out boyfriend Peter, lends welcomed comic relief to some pretty dark and painful scenes (pun intended).This movie is definitely not for the straight-laced; even though you've got to keep reminding yourself "It's only a movie." Not be be taken seriously. The tomato throwing scene was priceless.

Tom Cruise (Vincent) has complete control of his handguns in this movie. He blows away all his "targets" with style and panache. Well, he should. He's an extremely well-trained assassin, on a "night on the town" picking his victims from his notebook computer; going from place to place with Jamie Foxx as his unsolicited cab driver(?), Max. Ahhh...Vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people. I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley. HK USP, Glock, HK MP4, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Uzi? Just some of the guns used in this mayhem-for-hire movie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is one of his "targets."

I'm surprised no one's used my corny title for a review. Like many reviewers, I first purchased this on vinyl and loved every minute of it. Of course, the crowning glory of this CD is the masterpiece "All I Know." It's just that beautiful and unmistakable piano intro that always gets to me. Absolutely one of the most beautiful openings to a Pop ballad ever. The piano and lush string arrangements lend themselves to the marvelous and haunting voice of Art Garfunkel. So yes, I'm going to say it - If for nothing else, "All I Know" in itself, is worth the purchase of this great CD. But please give a listen to the rest of the selections. You'll enjoy them, too.

Typical and predictable behavior of the oppressor and oppressed. No really, you could see what was coming in a not so original premise for a lousy movie. As the conditions degraded and the paranoia got worse, the story became laborious. The usual scumbag "king of the hill" surfaces its ugly head to turn the little community into an anarchy unto itself.A cross between "Animal Farm" and "Lord Of The Flies?"

This was the first Bellson album I bought in the 70's and boy what a treat to hear Don Menza again. After leaving Buddy Rich and doing a few combo albums with Frank Strazzeri, it was good to hear Don again in a big band setting. Plus, playing alongside tenor section-mate Pete Christlieb made the sax section complete.Menza and Christlieb do some great solo work on "La Banda Grande," a medium tempo latin-tinged chart. Christlieb takes the more lyrical approach, whereas Menza finishes off the tune in his patented "scale rolling" solo. Blue Mitchell also injects some tasty trumpet in between. (Check out their sax exchanges on the super up-tempo "Time Check" from the Bellson album "150 MPH")On "Intimacy Of The Blues" and opening alto solo by Larry Covelli leads into another great Menza solo with Cat Anderson blowing up into the stratosphere to take the band out."Beyond Category" is a vehicle for Louie and he puts his double-bass drums to work. Classic Bellson drumming. But Louie Bellson always seems to showcase his sidemen more than himself. Very unselfish attitude.I saw his band twice; here in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 70's; with his Big Band "live" at The Concord Jazz Festival - "Dynamite." And a combo night club setting, featuring Blue Mitchell, Grant Geissman and Gordon Goodwin. (got some fantastic slides of these shows). Seeing Louie work in person is awe-inspiring. I don't think he ever broke out in a sweat. His drumming is so effortless.Menza's "Groove Blues" once again showcases a sax very cool soli that seems to be a Menza trademark with most of his compositions. Cat Anderson, once again lends his screeching talents at the end with the ensemble blowing right behind him. If you're a sax player (like me) and love Menza's sax soli's, you know that most of his arrangements are available. I bought most of them in the late 70's when they were only $25. They're quite expensive now, but worth it."Movin On" and "Quiet Riots" showcases the old "Tonight Show's" Pete Christlieb, with able assitance from Blue Mitchell.What a great introduction to Louie Bellson this was for me. I'm glad I finally bought the CD; because my vinyl LP was worn and my cassette copes were wearing thin.

The color, backdrops, pace and acting (yes, the acting was very good) lent to a very "downer" of a movie. Sure, I've watched a lot of movies that have had ongoing depressing scenes that ended in a sad story. Well, this is one of them.Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down-trodden lives of people who've hit bottom in some very tragic circumstances. You get a taste of betrayal, deception, lies and confusion, all rolled into one.I really don't know how to truly classify this movie other than that I would never want to watch it again. Yes, it is a "thought-provoking" movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end.

It was like watching a cheap "Movie Of The Week." Absolutely horrible acting. I realize the plot and circumstances that lead to the behavior of the characters, but the reactions of the onlookers were something of the nature of "Shawn Of The Dead." - almost comical. Even Elliot Gould and Jason Priestly seemed like they were reading off a script. The supporting actors weren't any better or convincing, which took away the effect of the movie.

Okay, was this made before or after "Rumor Has It?" Jennifer Aniston continues to convince me that her acting is pedestrian. She [is] one of those actors who just don't work in the big screen. She may have been fine on televsion but....she wrecked this film. I was very glad that she (Lucinda Harris) got blown away in the big shootout; unfortunately, too late in the film. The big shootout was the highlight of the film.Clive Owen as Charles Schine played his part very well. That being of the person victimized in a blackmail scheme by the sinister La Roche played by Vince Cassell and his convincingly scumbag accomplice Dexter, played by the one-dimensional Xzibit; whom I was also glad when he was blown away. I also enjoyed the final scene when La Roche gets it "stuck to him." After all the pain he put Schine and his family through. Yeah, even though it all because of Schine's attempted affair with Lucinda Harris.Oh, the storyline? Please read one of the "long-winded reviews."

First off, I need to correct one of the reviewers about Don Menza; he didn't play on this album, he wrote the arrangement 'Time Out.' Steve Marcus and Bob Mintzer were the tenor players.Barry Kiener's opening piano romp on Sammy Nestico's 'Ya' Gotta' Try' sets off the tempo of a great album; with Steve Marcus and Bob Mintzer trading off (also listen to Marcus and Walt Weiskopf on the "Burnin' for Buddy" album Vol-1). Keiner's rendition of 'Mickey Mouse' is absolutely beautiful. Yes, he was a virtuoso pianist that died so young, (My wife was greatly impressed by his playing when we saw Buddy's Band at The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, 1985)'No Jive' is a jazz-funk favorite of mine and Mintzer makes the most of his arrangement in his solo (listen to Steve Marcus' solo version on 'Burnin for Buddy - Vol 1).You'll be glad to hear Rick Stepton again in the band (from the Mercy, Mercy Band 1968) playing Lush Life. 'Tales of Rhoda Rat' is fun tune, and Menza's 'Time Out' is the centerpiece with Mintzer on tenor and flute solos, with Konikoff and Pratt on the trumpet solos.Great music on a great sounding album.Personnel: trumpets -Ross Konikoff, John Marshall, Dean Pratt, Dave Stahl; saxophones - Bob Mintzer, Alan Gauvin, Dean Palanzo, Steve Marcus, Mauro Turso; trombones - Rick Stepton, Clinton Sharman, David Boyle; Keyboards - Barry Kiener; Bass- Jonathan Burr; Guitar - Joshua Rich; Percussion - Erroll Bennett; AND OF COURSE, on Drums - BUDDY RICH

The skinheads looked like a bunch of malnourished prisoners from San Quentin (with the exception of the pint-sized bald urchin). They also reminded me of a bunch of Freddy Krueger Wanna-Be's; without the acne problem.SLEEEEEP!Kiefer Sutherland delivers his usual low-talking dialogue (just a tad louder than in "24"). Jennifer Connolly is an air-head nightclub singer (there is no day) and wife of "Murdoch." Murdoch? We wanders the streets "Tuning," between the 'time stops' and the 'flying baldies' pursuing him. Willian Hurt is cast in his usual "heavy" part that he's been relegated to, the past decade or so.SHELL BEACH, SHELL BEACH, SHELL BEACH. Yeah......real fun movie (he says tongue-in-cheek).

Once Al Sharpton and Wynton Marsalis opened their pie-holes, it started going downhill. And the usual rants about picking on "us people" (regardless of color) with the usual results got pretty tired. All the blame for the late response was well-deserved to the Bush Administration and all the machinery under it.If you read books about how all the red-tape of beaurocracy, paranoia, trickle-down theories and turf-wars (which the video doesn't really cover in detail) lead to all the delays, you'll be embarrassed as an American. Especially, if you know America's response for emergencies to other countries (i.e. We are usually the first to offer with help from Gov't and private donations. And the first to arrive).

Uh boy...I think Jamie Foxx (Rico) tried a little too hard in trying to portray the undercover heavy, by mumbling, mumbling, mumbling. Really annoying. The storyline of Gong Li (Isabella-the bad guys/girls businesswoman) with whom Colin Farrell (Sonny) got romantically involved, was really corny. The bad guys who supposedly had eyes on everything and everybody, never seemed to have their eyes on the undercover cops when they met their superiors.The climactic gun battle, which you'd expect from a movie like this, is really bogus. The idiotic Vice captain who was fumbling around like an amateur, trying to spot the bad-guy snipers with his night scope should have delegated that duty to HIS snipers (or counter-snipers); who ended up taking out the two bad snipes seconds before the big gun battle. As the gun battle ensued, the Vice cops were doing the majority of the shooting with the bad guys; when the S.W.A.T. assault team should've been there within a few seconds. When S.W.A.T. did show up, the battle was nearly over. And you kind of wonder what the heck happened to the snipers who should've been picking off the bad guys; who were continually exposing themselves to easy shots. But then again, you wouldn't have your exciting, long drawn-out, extended sequence "shootout" to thrill the movie-goers.The shootout scene in the trailer was better than the big shootout. Even though the dialogue between the rifle-wielding cop and bad guy was ridiculously laughable. Yeah-Yeah. It's only a movie.

What a gem of a movie. Imaginative writing that was so hilarious, I couldn't wait for the next scene, to see if it was going to be funnier that the previous one. Orson Bean (Doctor Lester) was an unbelievable filthy, dirty, sex-starved old coot - "Insane, old lech" is how John Cusak's character; Craig Schwartz put it. The interplay between Cusak and Kathryn Keener (Maxine) was "way out there." Excellent direction from Spike Jonze.I don't know what else to add but that this was the weirdest, most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. We should all be so lucky as to be in John Malkovich's eyes and then spit out 15 minutes later."I was John fu**ing Malkovich!" - exclaimed Cameron Diaz (Lotte Schwartz). A total crackup. "Malkovich!" "Malkovich!" "Malkovich!" "Malkovich!" You'll love "Craig's Dance Of Despair And Disillusionment"

I loved playing "Feels So Good" on the sax back when I was younger. And just like "Mr. Magic" I transcribed this solo before I started adding my own ideas when I was with a jazz combo in the late 70's. So many great improvisational ideas came out of this guys head. Amazing.

This movie was ridiculous, goofy, funny, stupid and very entertaining. I always like watching other people suffer from phony disasters. It gives me that warm, fuzzy feeling inside; knowing that Hollywood still has a place for run-down, used-up, has-been movie stars like Robert Wagner, Randy Quaid, James Brolin, etc., Then again, if I were out of work and someone asked me to star in a disaster flick - I'd been stomping over the other "has-beens" like me, in a minute. It's money in the bank (Shannon Doherty needed it), so can you really fault these "over-the-hill" types for taking these roles. No! "The Storm Of Global Proportions Is Coming" - The Out of Job Hollywood Actors Are Coming....Let's hope they're acting is not the cause of the End of The World. Hooo-boy.

For some reason this movie may have tried a little too hard with the comedy. A got a few snickers here and there from Harrison Ford's part-time Realtor gag and Josh Hartnett's attempt at becoming an actor, but somehow those scenes were really reaching - for something (especially in the interrogation rooms with IAD).I have a feeling that when the Distributor screened the final product with the Producer, Director, Editor, etc., they just said "Uhhh,okay."..."It stars Harrison Ford; it's got to be worth something!" I also have a feeling that at the Post-Production process the director may have winced at the ending scene as said "It's a Crapshoot," and then took a vacation.This movie just didn't work out right.

There's this one crazy scene where Nicole Kidman (Carol Bennell) is driving with her son Ollie, and a lot of the "changed people" hanging all over like a bunch of cockroaches, trying to breakthrough to kill her. It was hilarious when she hit a storefront and "they" all went flying like a bunch of bugs.The pace is very tedious, and sometimes you wonder why Carol, a psychiatrist can't keep it together without being emotional; which is what the "pod people" notice immediately. Oh well, she manages to "cap off" a half dozen "pods" including Daniel Craig (Ben Driscoll-he survives) her colleague in a drugstore attempting to escape, rather than give in andjoin them.I'm not a real fan of Nicole Kidman. There are times in the movie when you just want to shout out "kill" or "run" when Carol should kill, or run. I sometimes wonder why Nicole Kidman is given this type role; always the very weak-willed and vulnerable stereotypical female who just barely keeps it together just to survive. But then again, just like in "Lethal Weapon," "Rambo," or "Predator" you're gonna' need the good old calculator to rack up the Nicole Kidman "kills." Not bad for a female non-heroine. Just Kidding.Darn. They end up stopping the pandemic with widespread inoculations. Just when you think they (the uninfected) were going to start wholesale slaughter of the "Pod People." Oh yeah, Jeffrey Wright (Ride With The Devil, Syriana, Lady In The Water, Casino Royale) also starred as one of the Scientist buddy's to Daniel Craig.

I'll make it short: I've always been impressed by both these sax players. Andy has always been a firey soloist and Walt the Coltrane-type thinker. Absolutely first-hand music and soloists in this band. I've had a chance to see both of them live with Buddy in the early 80's and have many great 35mm shots of them. Fantastic CD.

Nicolas Cage just didn't stand a chance once he landed on that island (Summersisle) off Washington State, full of wackos. I just tried to think how he was going to overcome all those "forces" against him, but to no avail. This movie does not have a happy ending. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, the hero just doesn't survive this one. If you're the type who roots for the "good guy(s)" in horror movies, this one isn't for you. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus is out of his league (an in definite need of a SWAT team) against this island of matriarchal pagan zealots; in the search for his missing daughter.

Darn good movie about a Jewish fugitive who's Family and friends are massacred in an ambush, while attempting to escape the Nazis to neutral territory. She ends up helping the Dutch Resistance getting "inside" the local Gestapo to spy, sabotage and derail their actions against the Resistance in 1944. Excellent story line and script continuity that keeps you interested, with no slowdown between scenes.The Jewish woman Rachel Stein becomes Ellis De Vries and temps fate at nearly every corner, all the while, falling in love with the German Captain Meuntze; who is trying to reach a truce with the Resistance (unbeknownst to his Superiors). Barely escaping with her life, "The Resistance" still after her at war's end; thinking she had double-crossed them, contributing (wrongly) to the deaths of dozens of Jews and Dutch Resistance. With the "real collaborator" uncovered in the Black Book she happens upon, from one of the many Nazi collaborators as he's killed soon after the Allied Liberation.Excellent acting from Carice Van Houten as Rachel Stein/Ellis De Vries, Thom Hoffman as Dr. Hans Aakermanns; one of the Resistance leaders (and turning out to be a Nazi Collaborator), Sebastian Koch as the German Captain Ludwig Muentze and superb Direction by Paul Verhoeven.Darn, I'm really beginning to love these European films. Another good Dutch film is "May 6th" - (2004) Based on events surrounding the 2002 assassination of Pim Fortuyn.

This movie wasn't even scary. These crappy vampire movies are so predictable and poorly acted that they all seem alike. The vamps are always much smarter than we are. People doing really stupid things, like not really defending themselves against these "undefendables." Ya' know, these people had a lot of guns; shoot for the head and disintegrate the mothers. Yes, you've got an axe! Keep chopping! Don't just stand their waiting to see what happens. Hint: LIGHTS! Shotgun! Action!The vampires were really stupid characters. Why were they even talking? Especially when their victims couldn't understand what they were saying? The funny thing was, I kept thinking back at the population numbers on the board in front of the town; decreasing every time someone got "munched on. As a matter of fact, I was enjoying a juicy steak; medium rare, while watching all the gore. "Welcome to Barrow, Top of the World."For a lighthearted look at your favorite vampires, I suggest: "From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money"

This was one heck of a stinker. The director must have thought it "artsy" with the slow-motion, stop-start, and flash-changing scenes. These "touches" were extremely annoying throughout a film that was annoying enough with the terrible acting and accents. Bob Hoskins as Darius; the Russian Mob boss was particularly bad with his "Russian accent."Stephen Dorff playing the FBI agent Mike Varga on loan in Hungary, to stop the Russian Mafia did some narrating during the film; which didn't add anything to it. I've seen him in a few stinkers before; I added this one to my list. And his FBI superior, Rob Shephard (Ian Hunt) was also not very convincing, even as an American he came across very phony. That, and "Katya" (Laura Fraser), Darius's daughter, was nice to look at but a pain to listen to. She rounded out an absolutely boring and inept cast in a "bottom-of-barrel" directing effort by James Bruce.There's no use giving a story line, since this is really supposed to be a review. This film stunk.

I'm not going to rehash the storyline. I'll just say that everytime I watch this movie, it astounds me that Jack Lemmon didn't win an Academy Award for his part in this movie, as a diligent employee after an "accident" at the nuclear power plant in which he works. Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas also give admirable performances. Wilford Brimley is just as serious, intense and convincing in his portrayal as one of Lemmon's co-workers.The idea of only having a lead-in music theme (by Stephen Bishop-Somewhere In Between) and then leaving the rest of the movie devoid of additional music was absolute genuis. As the viewer is then given ample space for maximum concentration on the subject matter. I'm a movie-goer who loves music that heightens the drama and stirs the emotions, but this movie worked perfectly fine without it. And the emotional ending proved that music wasn't required (even with the ending credits scrolling).Sure, some parts of the story may have seemed far fetched; such as the hired thugs who go after anyone trying to expose the truth about the possible "China Syndrome" incident. But the usual cover-up from the higher-ups that we usually expect (or suspect) doesn't disappoint.Moral lesson(s), personal integrity, subterfuge, a [little] lesson in the operation of a nuclear power plant, differing viewpoints on the issue of nuclear power (whether staged or real) and an emotionally shocking ending are what this film is about. A great disaster movie for a disaster that didn't happen.

Roller coaster ride of emotions that leave you pretty well exhausted at the end. The many lives that are linked together in these mini-stories are fantastic. This is a MOVIE - so don't lose sight of that. If you have an axe to grind or take any of the social/racial issues too seriously; you won't enjoy this movie. If you hate racial stereotypes and racist attitudes and don't want to admit they still exist; don't watch this movie.But if you want to get caught up in the trials of these "Everyday people" - high and low; you'll never forget this movie. There are absolute gut-wrenching sequences that are played to tear your insides-out. You'll feel tension and release throughout the movie that may leave you emotionally drained and shocked. But the excellent acting and the sometimes seemingly disgusting attitudes of the characters leaves you no doubt that you are watching a very deep and well thought-out production.A monster of an under-rated movie.

I really liked the cameo appearances by Trisha Yearwood and Pam Tillis. K.T. Oslin did a great job as Lucy, the proprietor of the restaurant/club "The BlueBird Cafe" that the musicians auditioned for Saturday night performances. Sandra Bullock, as Linda Lue Linden was hokey, but lovable. I really wasn't that much impressed by the late River Phoenix as James Wright. Samantha Mathis plays a roller-coaster ride role; who just can't make up her mind as to what she really wants in life (the career in singing isn't that obvious). Still, a very nice movie about the hopes and dreams of would-be country singers; and also the songs of Trisha.

The only thing that keeps me from giving these shows 5 Stars is because so much local talent was utilized (yes, I know that was good for the actors and the economy) and it suffered from some pretty bad (i.e. hokey) acting with them. If you look back at some of the "Dirty Harry" movies, you'll notice a lot of these "locals" who acted in that series.Other than that, it's always great to see all the locations in San Francisco and Daly City (where I lived) that were used as the backdrop of this great Crime Show. Living in the adjacent city and being born in San Francisco brought excitement every time I saw the show filming at locations I was passing by, or had heard they would be filming.With a myriad of guest stars filling the weekly bill, the show was never short of "talent." And of course, kicking off "Streets" with one of the greatest and most recognizable themes helped a lot. I mean, who didn't love that fantastic Pat Williams chart with Tom Scott blazing on alto?

Easily one of the most inspiring and combat intensive movies of WWII. There are some great scenes of fire and maneuver tactics; especially in the opening battle when the platoon led by Lt. "Stock" (Ty Hardin) hits the Japanese artillery battery before they descend on Walaubum.Another great battle scene is where the Marauders hit the railway at Shaduzup. The highlight being the nightmarish close quarter battle at the tank traps near the oil storage tanks. It concludes with "Stock" walking on top of the tank traps amid the horrendous piles of Japanese and American dead.Jeff Chandler does an admirable job of playing the tough and firm Brigadier General Frank Merrill pushing his men to the limit on General Joseph Stillwell's orders. Claude Akins (Rio Bravo, The Devils Brigade, Movin' On) gives a memorable performance as Sgt. Kolowicz, Peter Brown (Lawman, Days Of Our Lives, Loving) plays the sharpshooter "Bullseye," Will Hutchins (Sugarfoot) as the bottomless pit stomach "Chowhound," Charley Briggs as "Muley" the mule handler of "Eleanor" with Filipino actor Pancho Magalona as "Taggy," and rounding out the able cast of supporting actors is Andrew Duggan as "Doc."

Amazon needs to give an option for half a star rating. After the initial "blackout" the acting was like a bad 1970's Made-For-TV Movie. People must have really been bored or were used to B-Grade acting. This was just pure garbage! Unbelievable that audiences would put up with such cliche'-ridden dialogue.Courtney B. Vance was reading his lines as if he were back on "Law and Order," which made it all the more ridiculous. John Cho's part was perfect for this show; because his acting really sucked eggs (talk about bad method-acting. OY!) I was laughing through the entire first season (didn't go through the entire episodes) and then realized there was a second season that I didn't waste time on (I checked it out from the public library-no money wasted).I believe most of the rave reviews here are from the "LOST" lemmings, who tried so badly to fill the void in their lives, and had to grasp at something so terribly acted, it was laughable. Then I remembered reading the article "Why Flash Forward Canceled, and Five Good Reasons Why That's Good" - Enough Said.

What a great movie. A real put-on of a horror flick with Robert Patrick (The Unit, Terminator 2) as Buck; one of the would-be bank robbers who doesn't end up as a Vampire. And Bo Hopkins (Smokey And The Bandit Movies, Killer Elite, The Wild Bunch) as the Sherrif Lawson; hunting down Luther (Duane Whitaker) the leader of the gang.It's very funny how the movie starts off with vampires attacking people in a movie, only to become real when the bank robbers head down to Mexico to rob a bank; as it turns out at night - the only time vampires can come out.Anyway, without dragging on with the plot; one vampire; bartender Danny Trejo (Delta Farce, Grindhouse, Halloween, Heat, Spy Kids) starts off the bloddletting biting Luther; so forth and so on. A great short movie that you immediately recognize as a Quentin Tarantino flick once the Western-style guitar starts twanging. Blood and gore galore, with many comedic moments, as one would expect from a Quentin Tarantino collaboration. The ubiquitous crosses are pulled out any which way they can be to ward off the blood-suckers with the resultant spike in the heart or Sun rising and the "you-know-what" conclusion. Refreshing humor.

For some reason, I couldn't take this movie seriously. It was the way that all the people looked at Jodie Foster (Kyle) when she told everyone that her daughter was missing on the plane. The flight attendants and passengers looked like they were going to give "that look" from the comedy "Airplane." In fact, any minute I was expecting Leslie Nielsen to show up and say "Stop calling me Shirley." Wait a minute, I was expecting Sean Bean (The Captain) to say "Stop calling me Shirley."Foster mentions to the captain and attendants that she was under the medication of Klonopin. Well, as the film kept dragging on, I felt like I was on Klonopin - not that I've ever taken Klono.......pin. Never mind.It was a nice trip through the entire plane, while everyone was looking for Kyle's daughter. I loved the "pained expression" on the Sky Marshal's face when Foster was berating him. Come to think of it, seems like everyone had a pained expression when inconvenienced by Foster - in particular, the Middle Eastern guys. Goofy movie.

Who cares if I give it away. Most of you have probably seen this flick anyway. No,no....Bad DEA Agents (Christian Slater and Co.) with dirty money in cahoots with scumbags. Bad DEA Agents kill scumbags, someone else gets a hold of the money (19+ something young couple), Bad DEA Agents hunt them down while other cops figure out DEA Agents are the "bad guys" not the kids who stole their (DEA) money. DEA and kids tussle a bit, someone is killed (guess which side?) and finally Bad, Bad DEA Agents (CS and Co.) die. Someone gets away/off; "significant other" dies.I think that about sez it all. Not one of Christian Slater's better efforts (read stinker. See Hard Rain).

Christian Slater's character was a bit much to watch. He had Robinson's (Wes Bentley) wife Elizabeth, assassinated before she could testify witnessing him killing some "coyote's." Way over the top and exaggerated performance by Slater as Jimmy Dolan - a trafficker of women in the sex trade. I was glad when Wes Bentley's character finally buried him alive (on a highway) at the end. The scenes leading up to Slater's demise were the only good parts of the movie. Robinson really tortures Dolan psychologically before finishing him off.

For me, the very best part of the movie is the final scene with the song "Prepare Ye The Way" and then the uptempo version of "Day By Day" with the exciting chorus and magnificent guitar and organ solos. I loved the transition of the dancers on the empty streets leading to the corner where the crowds suddenly appear in great numbers, culminating with the sounds of traffic and then the rousing chorus during the movie credits. What an inspirational film. Fantastic music in a New York setting.

Terence Stamp was supposed to be dead, but ended up still alive in the end to save the young couple. Yeah, well, you have to see this movie to believe it. British humor. This is not helpful.

When I saw the sequence of events starting with the wind blowing the trees and then a cop shooting himself and then a driver picking up the gun and shooting himself, then a pedestrian walking by picking up the very same gun; shooting herself. Honestly, it looked like something from "MAD TV or "Saturday Night Live" - absolutely comedic. Mark Wahlberg's ditzy, airhead wife was the most annoying character of all. STUNK! STUNK!The reviewers who purport to be more open-minded and forgiving of this jerk M. Night Shamalaladingdong, are the kind of people who speak in esoteric terms at parties.

Comedic, laughable, bush league, is just a few words that best describe this flop. Activate "subtitles" because some of the "foreign" actors are unintelligible (it was made in Europe, but they're still foreign to me). You'll honestly think you're watching a parody of a disaster movie produced by Weird Al Yankovic. The opening music must have been taken from your stock disaster movies from the past. Like AIRPLANE. But I digress.Want to laugh at a really bad movie that would illicit a "Worst Actor" nomination to Dean Cain? This is it. Cheaply made, terribly scripted, badly acted, ridiculous premise (aren't all disaster movies?).If you can exercise, read a book, surf the Web, and eat a meal while watching this amateur film project, you deserve an OSCAR.

One of John Turturro's worst performances, if not the worst. Babbling in French like some ethereal thinking, Homer Simpson was laughable. And he was supposed to be an assassin? Whatever her name was, as the lead came across as an incompetent "agent" of whatever she was tasked to do. A brother and sister frolicking and having sex. What a waste of time.Dumb European production trying to copy a premise (if that's what you want to call it) more suited as a big budget American film, failed. Nick Nolte's appearance made things even more laughable and unbearable. Goofy movie.I don't care if this review helps no one. Just wanted to get across how much a stinker of a movie this is.

I couldn't get enough of the antics of Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, using his powers of observation (as opposed to his former fake psychic abilities) to help reveal clues for his team to solve cases. Much to the embarrassment of many suspects lives (and lies) and also "innocent bystanders." And lead agent, Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) is always in control, but wondering what tricks Jane "has up his sleeve," and what orders he isn't going to follow or ignore. Sometimes dragging one or all of her team members with him, working on a hunch, or just being insubordinate. Because he really isn't a cop, "Just a Consultant" - he really doesn't have to follow rules or anyone's orders. Or so he thinks.There are many light-hearted scenes, interspersed with the serious parts of crime-solving. Agents Cho (Tim Kang) and Rigsby (Owain Yeoman) can be crack-ups as they interact. Cho, being the serious one, and Rigsby the "Get it?" "I don't get it?" guy. Rigbsy also being in love with Agent Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti - See episode "Russet Potatoes"), the rookie who to wants to prove herself, and believes in the life hereafter, as opposed to Jane's atheistic view.I liked the fact that some episodes conclude with somewhat sappy, happy endings (with Jane's help), and others with darker, more somber endings; reminding Jane of the deaths of his family at the hand of Red John. And also Jane reflecting on his obsession with finding and killing Red John, and whether it will make any difference to the emptiness in his life; knowing it won't bring his family back. The dialogue between Lisbon and Jane in the final moments of the season ending finale (see episode "Red John's Footsteps") is both haunting and touching. Excellent writing, acting, directing and mood music.P.S. Robin Tunney is so darn cute, and Amanda Righetti is gorgeous.

For me the title chart "Threshold" was the highlight. A 3-part Suite opens with a brass chorale leading to Tom Scott cooking on flute (Scott doubled on many of the overdubbed sax parts), then the band takes it to a gently bopping Marvin Stamm solo. Closing out with a beautiful tenor sax by Scott. We played this chart in college jazz band back in 1976, so it was particularly exciting for me to play the closing solo."Mr. Smoke" is as the name implies; it SMOKES! The chart opens up with a cool harmonica solo provided by Tommy Morgan a la' Rockford Files (wah-wah guitar in the background). Tom Scott takes over with another bop cooking flute solo. Marvin Stamm follows with a pensive muted trumpet solo. The brass and saxes open it with a tension-releasing, smoking soprano sax solo by Scott, with the ensemble closing it out with a rousing climax.And On The Sixth DayThe WitchThresholdA Lady Beside MeMr. Smoke

Besides all the incorrect and alarmist-type rhetoric these two people spout out, it's just "Business As Usual" from the anti-gun lobby. Their arguments or [facts] are absolutely misinformed. Whenever you get a pair of incompetents trying to explain a subject or subjects they know very little of; you get a comic book style dissertation that only confirms to Americans that most journalists are liberal nuts, with no common sense.

A high school classmate of mine took me to this concert as a birthday present. We were out front of the band, and boy, was it exciting. Having introduced my fellow jazz band mates to the "Live At The Fillmore" album, we were more than ready to listen and see up close and personal this fantastic musical organization. I was especially glad to see and hear the sax section of Sam Falzone, Lonnie Shetter, Fred Selden and Jon Clarke; even though John Klemmer was no longer with the band. Milcho Leviev was very cool. His facial expression were wicked."5/4 Getaway" is one of my all-time favorites with Don's boppish trumpet solo, the sax soli and unsion drum solos. But the clincher for me was super-cool "Strawberry Soup," with the wonderful sax soli presentation, that ended with all saxes improvising. The string section was fantastic, especially on Strawberry Soup (can you tell, it was my favorite?)! Of course, the rest of the selections were all excellent and mostly loud (when you're in the front of the band, everything's loud). "How's This For Openers," "Samba Bajada," "Euphoric Acid" - typical of the esoteric titles of most of the band's charts.I've got a coaster from Basin Street West with Don's signature, date and comment to prove it (He was nice enough to spend a few minutes to talk with us during the break). I also have a few photos (albeit dark) that I surreptitously took during the concert. Lucky me. I personally feel this was the best album by the band. Not just because I was there, but because Strawberry Soup surpasses The Great Divide (from "Live At Fillmore") as their greatest chart. I also have the original vinyl LP.Personnel: Don Ellis - Quarter-tone trumpet, four-valve flugelhorn and drums.Trumpets - Paul Bogosion, Jack Caudill, Bruce MacKay,French Horn - Kenneth NelsonTrombones - Jim Sawyer, Kenny SawhillTuba and Contrabass trombone - Doug BixbyWoodwinds - Fred Selden, Lonnie Shetter, Sam Falzone, Jon ClarkeStrings - Alfredo Ebat, Earl Corry, Ellen Smith, Christine ErmacoffPiano - Milcho LevievBass - Dennis ParkerDrums - Ralph Humphrey, Ron DunnCongas - Lee Pastora

This CD is a real jewel of a find for Buddy's small combos. This one put together from his 1978 band, along with Lionel Hampton and his jazz tenor; Paul Moen. Lack of liner notes forces one to search the Internet for personnel on this date. Also released as "The Sound Of Jazz,"and "Lionel Hampton Presents Buddy Rich"An interesting blend of scoring for the three tenors. It turned out to be a fantastic blend of harmonies on the two initial charts. Nice combo recording by Rich and Hampton; with admirable support from Steve Marcus, Paul Moen, Gary Pribeck and Barry Kiener.The opening track of "Moments Notice" really romps, with the late Barry Kiener's piano leading to Gary Pribeck, Paul Moen, Steve Marcus, Kiener, Hamp and Buddy. The tenors really cook on this chart.In Coltrane's "Giant Steps." Pribeck starts off, with Moen batting next and then Steve Marcus on soprano sax."Take The A Train" features Hamp, the unnamned bass player, congas (Candido) Kiener and Buddy. Very easy swinging."Buddy's Cherokee" Is a vehicle for Steve Marcus's soprano sax. Another very easy-going chart with Hamp and Buddy interjecting their solos in between."My Funny Valentine" starts off with Steve Marcus back on tenor, followed by Kiener and Hamp. Barry Kiener adds some very charming touches during his solo."I'll Never Be The Same" is a vehicle mostly for Hamp, with a strong contribution again from Barry Kiener. Very sad that such as talented voice was taken from us at so young an age."Latin Silk" has a very, very nice Latin beat that leads to a Steve Marcus soprano solo, followed by a very tasteful and biting Barry Kiener piano solo.

In the same vein as "Love Music," the first track; "Sunny Day" lends pure excitement with the voices of Bonnie, Lisa and Maritetta. Plus, the brass arrangement with Hank Redd's biting alto sax solo. "It's So Obvious That I Love You" and "It's Up To You" demonstrate the great harmonic qualities of "The Girls" in this wonderful band. But especially surprising, is the marvelously flowing tenor sax of Don Menza on the beautiful song "Tell Me In A Whisper." Another great album in a line of great ones from none other than Sergio and his many iterations of his bands through the years.

The "vantage points" of each witness to the attempted assassination and subsequent kidnapping of the President of the United States is really annoying. Forest Whitaker's dumba** character could has been eliminated (yeah, like a fumbling guy like him could really run that fast - laughable). The really stupid ending of Dennis Quaid chasing the bad guys who kidnap the President was long and arduous. The chase is not in any way shape or form in the classic car chases of "Bullitt," "The Seven-Ups" or "Ronin" The chase went on for what seemed like miles from the explosion(s) leaves you wondering why people were still running in in panic on the streets miles away(?) Poor direction and the aforementioned repetitious scenes rate this lower than low.

Pay no attention to the critics review on the DVD cover. This movie is not funny. The most depressed, dysfunctional, angst-filled family you'd ever have the displeasure of meeting. Plus, psychotic next door neighbors to boot. Jack Black gave about three minutes of comedy; the rest was a depressed, insecure, unemployed bozo with no redeeming qualities. Nicole Kidman was a paranoid, know-it-all, critic of everyone's life. This film just sucked. All tragedy - no comedy. Pathetic wriring and direction.

Well, if you can get through all the Rasta talk that really utilized the subtitles (thank goodness) and the usual drugged-up kids on Spring Break; you'll kinda' get the story line of the father on the run from the Feds, and everything else in between.Sub-plots can get maddening after awhile, but they all come together at the end to make a pretty darn good movie. Orlando Bloom wasn't really the star. Just one of the many characters that lent themselves to the seemingly corrupt and somewhat care-free existence on the island.Bill Paxton's little on-the-run from the Feds story tends to drag, but comes up roses in the end. As does his daughter, whom he forcibly takes from school, once the Feds raid his home in the U.S.Orlando Bloom's little love story, which doesn't end on a high note, but nevertheless comes to a tragic conclusion, intertwines itself amongst the gangsta drug dealers lives.The ending is really a payoff for the tedious individual stories throughout the film. If you can get past the numerous f*** and nig**r words used by visitor and gangster alike (especially the f*** word used liberally, to almost comic effect by the lawyer in the end), then the ending will be all worthwhile. Patience with the plots is the by-word for this film.Great ending.

The opening track "Moments Notice" with the late Barry Kiener's great solo leads to Gary Pribeck, Paul Moen, Steve Marcus, Kiener, Hamp and Buddy. These tenors really cook on this chart.I've always enjoyed Paul Moen, who played with Lionel Hampton. You'll also like his solo in Coltrane's "Giant Steps." Pribeck starts off, then Moen and Steve Marcus on soprano."Take The A Train" features Hamp, the unamned bass player, congas (Candido?) Kiener and Buddy. Very easy swinging."Buddy's Cherokee" Is a vehicle for Steve Marcus's soprano sax.

It turned out to be a fantastic blend of harmonies when they state the theme(s) on my two aforementioned favorites. Never nice combo recording by Rich and Hamp. Admirable support from Steve Marcus, Paul Moen, Gary Pribeck and Barry Kiener.

Tim Daly does a very good job of playing a lawyer with a longtime unemotional persona and sleep-deprived condition. He later learns his "condition" is due in part because of his abusive mother during his childhood. Her accidental death at his recently deceased aunts house (in which he temporarily resides) isn't realized until he gets "haunted" and learns the truth from his childhood priest and his present psychotherapist; who concealed the facts from him all this time.Tom Arnold is terrible as his partner in the law firm. Arnold has this horrid haircut that makes him look like a wannabe hipster (trying to look young, while already looking too old), but only adds to detract more of his presence in the film. Zoe Saldana is okay as the psychic trying to help Daly find the source of the "haunting" of his aunt's house.Nice ending of Daly falling down the stairs (After seeing a vision his dead mother at the foot of the stairs, where she died) and dying shortly thereafter. He then joins her (as a child) at the picnic they missed (due to her death). So did she really draw him back into the house to join her in death?

Top-notch performances by Christian Bale (Dan Evans) and Russell Crowe (Ben Wade), including Logan Lerman (son-William) and Ben Foster (as Crowe's "2nd," Charlie Prince). This is now one my favorite "Westerns" of all time. Fantastic action and acting from the principals and the supporting cast: (Peter Fonda - Byron McEloy, Gretchen Mol - Alice Evans, Alan Tudyk - Doc). Breath-taking panoramic scenery. Gripping, tense and redeeming performances by both Bale and Crowe, with a sad but rewarding ending. That's all I gotta' say.

Just like Gooding's "The Devils Tomb" he goes around with that faux "Dirty Harry" sneer that makes him look freaking ridiculous. No, this film just proves why Gooding is no longer a leading actor (if ever). Typical stereotypical gangster garbage. Really sucks. Miguel Ferrer also terrible acting.

Dennis Hopper as the warden, commite suicide by ripping his face off in the "execution chamber," right before the big execution (of Mowatt); and with all the guards just looking on without trying to stop him.? One critic on the DVD label said it was one of his best performances? He acted like King Koopa in Supe Mario Bros. The guard who tauted Mowatt blows his brains out in front of the other guards. The judge who sentences the killer to death kills himself weeks after the killer pinches him on the neck in the courtroom. A scene shows militaty helicopter gunships escorting the killer to prison (supposedly giving support to the police convoy) with one helicopter firing its guns at another chopper in front of it? What was that supposed to mean? What a stupid movie.

Diane Lane in an uninspiring role as a cyber cop. Like this hasn't been done before on TV by one of the myriad crime shows. Acting was pretty bad. As I watched the movie, I kept saying to myself "I know what's going to happen next." It was comical hearing them referring to trojans, netbots, and all the cyber mumbo-jumbo. I was really impressed (he said, tongue in cheek). Because the storyline became so predictable, you don't care for the victims. Just a stupid movie.

Well, I took me at least three hours to fall asleep after watching this movie; because I kept hearing noises outside my window and door.If the Danvers State Insane Asylum were still in existence today, I would love to have taken a tour through the entire complex (wherever safe) with a few friends, two flashlights each, a cell phone and walkie-talkies. Especially in the subtunnels. What a creepy place.I especially enjoyed this film because it wasn't the sudden "slasher around the corner" type. Which is why the pacing worked perfectly. The characters were great, as was the acting. The "run through the tunnel" while the lights were dying out in sequence, was especially horrifying. Marvelous writing and directing.If I were to be one of those Hazmat workers, it would probably have been the guy who was obsessed with the tape recordings of Mary Hobbes #444. That was spooky listening to those tapes. It kind of reminded me of my son's video game "Bioshock."

There isn't much more to say that what I've stated in the heading of my review. Plus, what others have said in their "mini-dissertations." Who says that all horror movies have to have a happy ending? This one certainly didn't. And it more than leaves you saddened and depressed (it'll wear off); but that is a good thing, because you'll never forget this movie if just for the ending. Wow!Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, Tobie Jones, Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen and the rest of the cast give tension-filled and sometimes maddening performances in this thriller (more so than the actual monsters). Those who think that Marcia Gay Harden as the wacked-out Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody overdid it, have never been around religious zealots as she portrayed. Believe me, I've gone to churches where there are such self-righteous, "Fire and Brimstone" fanatics all but condemning you to Hell without warning. Which made her character all the more real and frightening.This movie is unforgettable. And Thomas Jane's final scene makes it so.

The mellow arrangement of "Days Of Wine And Roses" spotlights the beautiful trumpet solo of Danny Nolan; which is among his finest and most lyrical. The finger-snapping "Sidewalks Of Cuba" showcase a standout trumpet solo by Danny Nolan leading to the bari sax of Nick Brignola, with Woody's always great clarinet closing it out. The smooth tenor of Carmen Leggio is featured in "The Good Earth"Woody's lyrical alto sax is showcased in the standard "Body And Soul." As is Jackie Stevens' liquid tenor sax in the famous "Early Autumn." Phil Wilson displays his blowing talents in his imaginative solo work on "Lonesome Old Town."You gotta' love the uptempo charts "That's Where It Is" and "Apple Honey" with Sal Nistico showing off his usual blazing tenor sax.And what Herman performance wouldn't be complete without "The Four Brothers"? Happy solos by all the saxes. The closer; "Caldonia" at a break-neck tempo, features just about everyone.Of course, Bill Chase's screeching, stratospheric trumpet is featured throughout, and can't be ignored. As a funny aside to Bill Chase - you'll notice many times during the taping, Bill adjusting his tie while looking at the monitor. Those high-note specialists need to loosen their ties when hitting those octaves; but he also realizes that he must remain uniform with the rest of the band.No, you can't turn back the hands of time, but looking back at a more subtle

Mr. Cooper shows his old age in writing these "memoirs." Repetitious and annoying statements by the author makes you skip around the book for more lucid commentary, but to no avail. There have got to be better books out there about the Sherman tank in WWII battles. Get this book from a library or garage sale.

Excellent script, direction, acting and storyline. Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, the "bomb-maker" of a secret terrorist organization is convincing as the "deep cover operative" and Guy Pearce as the relentless FBI agent Roy Clayton on his trail. The last few tension-filled minutes are worth it; and amply demonstrates that superior direction and editing can result in an excellent movie. Great support from Said Taghmaoui as Omar, Samir's "brother-in-arms."The last couple of minutes got me really tense as I thought Don Cheadle (Samir) was going to get blown away by the "other guards" on the boat (what happened to them when the good guys boarded the ship?).Anyway, I figured Samir had somehow sabotaged the simultaneous bombings by wiring the explosives incorrectly on all the bombers. Then I saw that they all seemed to have boarded only one type of bus line. Sure, it could've been a nationwide bus service, so I figured he'd set them all to blow up together. Didn't realize that one was enough to take out the entire "crew." Too bad that hapless bus driver had to be sacrificed.

Most of the stories of the activity into North Vietnam reads like a Keystone Cops comic book. For the most part, a depressing account of the "recruits" the CIA had to work with. Lost patrols, predictable ambushes, North Vietnamese deception techniques, among political foul-ups leads you to wonder why they ever attempted that Secret War.If you want to know why the U.S. failed in this Secret War; you came to the right place. This book will have your head shaking in disbelief through most of your reading. Good Luck.

Always an annoying trait of the Daleks was their loud distorted voices. If it weren't for the fact that they were/are important subjects of the Doctor Who series, I'd want them "exterminated." They sure looked more cheaply-built than the originals, what happened? Trashy-looking. I mean, they always looked like garbage cans with a toilet plunger and .50 caliber machine gun barrel heat-sink stuck to them, but these were terrible re-creations(?) EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! - on and on and on.........................Anyway, I noted that just like in 'The Power Of Kroll" where the Swampies were wearing RIck James wigs, so do the Movellans in this series. I now know where Rick James, the "Super Freak" singer got the inspiration for his "head gear."Tom Baker is at his usual best, with comedic scenes and lines. Especially where he's trapped under a concrete column, reading a book; criticizing the author, waiting for Romana to fetch the help of K-9.

All three of the main characters were great in their individual reactions to the news of getting drafted and most likely to go to war.SPOILER: Chapter 10 - the scene with Mara (Sofia Vassileva) and Dixon, the cab driver (John Bernthal) is the most touching, moving and absolutely heart-breaking of the entire movie. The soon-to-be soldier going off to war, leaving a memento behind for a loved one. In this case, his neighbor's daughter who he has befriended. The ages-old promise that he will return. With the ages-old reaction from the loved one of thoughts that this soldier, like thousands before him, in wars past; may never come back. Excellent performances by the two actors in that scene.Elijah Wood gives an excellent portrayal of a psychologically troubled, socially inept, nerdy, wimp, pacifist-type writer; the kind of person who should never be admitted into the service. And who finally deals with his fears and the hopelessness of it all in the end (read END).Chris Klein played the part of a lawyer who's Dad has connections with a U.S. Senator, to try and help him get out of the draft. And who in the end, seemingly decides to go after all.

This is [The] most amateurish, sorry, excuse for a movie I've ever had the displeasure of watching. It was so badly acted, and the "Special Effects" so laughable that I only got through 43 minutes before I took it out and returned it. There are Jr. High and High School productions better than this tripe. Please don't waste your time or money on this "bar coaster."

The opening chart "Hookin' It" with Andy Fusco's great alto sax solo gives you a good idea of what's to come. Great brass section work closing it out.The following "Brush Strokes" shows Buddy's mastery of the brushes, and quiets the critics who thought he couldn't play anything but loud drum solos. Great technical work on the brushes.Andy Fusco is showcased on the chart "If You Could See Me Now." I believe Andy was the best alto player Rich had in all the years of his big band. Even more exciting than Richie Cole, whom I thought was the best at the time of "Keep The Customer Satisfied." The song starts out as the usual ballad, but switches gears in the middle, and once again shows off Andy's great improvisational prowess. Then the song shifts back to the slower tempo to finish off another great Fusco performance.Bob Mintzer's "Good News" is a great 3-part suite that'll blow you away with the great opening, leading to a fantastic Steve Marcus solo cadenza. Then moving to a fast tempo for Buddy's solo. As noted, the trumpets missed the queue towards the end of Buddy's solo, and you'll notice he wasn't too pleased with it. But you'll also notice that the trumpets were grooving on his solo so much, which is why they missed the queue. Dave Stahl lends some great high note moments."West Side Story" will give you a short but sweet glimpse of the improvisational skills of Walt Weiskopf who handles the tenor solo (He would later play with Steely Dan, and on his own CD's-check him out). Of course, the Master Drummer does his thing, and the trumpets don't miss the queue this time.Don Menza's "Time Check," always one of the most played and requested numbers by the Rich Band (Groovin' Hard being one of the others) is played at one of the fastest tempos I'd heard or seen this band play. Steve Marcus again shows why he was such a great soloist with this band. The sax soli is played super-fast, and Marcus has very little time from the end of his solo into the sax soli to catch his breath. But what a fantastic job by the entire band to take them out and close the show.

It was just like watching a one-man improve on stage, at your local community theater. The constant inquiries with his auto club, regarding directions got really old (with Judy, the CSA). The conversation with the "no habla ingles" was really dumb. The highway patrol "trash enforcer" was sooooo stupid (gee, I would've never thought he was dead"). One of the dumbest plots I've seen on the DVD screen.I'm glad this movie went unnoticed by most of the world. Why is Danny Trejo always cast as a heavy bad guy? (Except for "Spy Kids") Luckily, he only shows up the last few minutes. The only good thing about this movie was the ending. Only because you're going to be glad it ended so soon. Only 80 minutes [LONG]. THANK GOODNESS!

Absolutely atrocious. Michael Madsen in his usual stereotype tough-guy movie. Someone mentioned an ex-Navy SEAL did the fight sequences? Not the firefight sequences, which were amateurish at "worst." The opening scenes of the Ghenghis Khan crap was hilarious. They obviously didn't hire enough Asian actors, so they had a bunch of lilly white guys trying to look like Mongols. The acting and direction was pathetic. You can always tell when they story line and acting is going to stink within the first few minutes; this movie doesn't fail in that department.Long story short - after 13 minutes, you'll be glad you didn't buy this garbage. If you did, you must be one of the many who want to pawn this movie off on Amazon. You won't wonder where all the wannabee actors are in Hollywood, because they're safely out of Hollywood doing these cheap, trashy, crappy movies in the boonies where they belong. This movie stunk like a pile of compost.The prerequisite for acting in this movie was to be psychopathic killer and spout profanities at will. I've seen better short movies on You Tube.

I can't believe I used to watch such camp. But of course, it was because the weirdness of Tom Baker that made him the most popular Dr. Who to me (David Tennant coming in second).The dude at the controls of the processing plant flipping switches in no particular order, must have been SOP in TV shows and movies when an actor was placed in front of a myriad of switches. "Just flip a few switches here and a few switches there. Make it look as if you know what you're doing" - must have been the direction given to the actor(s) at a time when computers weren't readily available (or understood) in Hollywood or BBC TV series. Bottom of the barrel "Low Tech"Those green "Swampies" doing their uncoordinated dance and chanting to Kroll; once again proves that "White Men Can't Dance" (he said tongue-in-cheek). I was waiting for Rick James to pop out of the swamp with a rousing "She's Supah Freekaaay!" The guns that Rohm-Dutt supplied to the Swampies looked like over-sized blow dryers used on "Afro's." I still enjoy watching the old series with Tom Baker (love Romana). Great stuff.
