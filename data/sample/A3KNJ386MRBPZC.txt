This extremely slow and tedious &quot;thriller&quot; concerns a high ranking RussianNaval officer, Viktor Archenko, who has passed information to the British Secret Service for years. His cover has been blown and he is in mortal danger. He wants to be removed and it is the job of a group of MI6 agents to get him out of the country and safely back to Britain.Gerald Seymour uses quick sections with alternating point of views to tell the story in this overblown and introspective espionage novel. This technique should serve to accelerate the pacing, keep the pages flying and readers at the edge of their seats. Actually the author spends a great deal of time covering every possible bit of minutia on all the major characters. The reader really never has the opportunity to feel any sympathy toward any of the relatively large cast. Like John LeCarre, Gerald Seymour writes a very literate spy novel but it isn't an exciting or enjoyable read.

Hula Girls is a heartwarming story about a group of women relatedto miners in the north of Japan. A mine will be closing leaving manyout of work. In an effort to keep jobs, the company wants to create aminiature Hawaii in their city. They want and need Hula girls and bringin a special teacher from Tokyo. The movie dramatizes this true story into a feel good movie about how these clumsy women turn into a very impressive group of professional dancers. We have seen a variation of this film so often- the, shall we say, transformation film. This one is merely okay- yet it will pull on the heartstrings even through the predictable ending.

David Spier is an ER physician at the UCLA Emergency Room. He is on duty when nurses are brought in with severe facial burns due to an attack with lye. It appears a man has targeted nurses for these brutal assaults. When the assailant, named Clyde, is actually apprehended, he is wounded and under David's care. The police want him in custody. However,David hesitates in releasing Clyde because he fears for Clyde's safety. One of the detectives on the case has a sister who was severely injured by Clyde. David wants Clyde brought in under his terms. Unfortunately, Clyde escapes and David is the scapegoat. David feels especially guilty when the attacks continue. He feels personally responsible and wants to do all he can to stop Clyde. This leads to a very dangerous cat and mouse game.Gregg Hurwitz has written a very clever thriller albeit on the lengthy side. David Spier is a man of great principles and it can be quite a bit irritating to see him fear for Clyde's safety which, predictably, leads to his escape. It is an unrealistic character flaw in David and, as such, makes him almost a comic book hero. Other characters are stereotypic. However, the pacing of the plot makes up for any character flaws. The bottom line is the author tells a great story-- perfect for pure entertainment. A truly fun read.

THE GEOGRAPHER'S LIBRARY by Jon Fasman (Penguin, $24.95) Paul Tomm, a reporter for a small weekly newspaper in New England is writing the obituary of a local professor. As he investigates, he discovers that there is more to the professor that meets the eye. It seems he was keeping artifacts that were stolen almost a thousand years ago from a geographer's library. Someone is now collecting them and this might be related to the professor's death. In alternative chapter form, the reader follows the trials and tribulations of Paul Tomm's investigation and the story of each of the artifacts stolen. Of course, there is an element of danger which reaches a climax at the conclusion of the book.Jon Fasman is an impressive writer with a vital imagination. There is a feeling of authenticity in the many descriptions of the artifacts, as well as, the locale of the many stories within the story. Paul Tomm's investigation does provide some suspense and is easy to follow until about two thirds through when things become increasingly complex and quite muddled. A more direct story line in future books would bode well for Mr. Fasman. This one is a mild recommendation.

There is a certain knack in writing a thriller. Primarily it has to do with the pacing of the story combined with sympathetic characters. The best writers know just how to stretch out the suspense to keep the pages flying and the reader's eyes glued to the page whatever the hour. In many ways, this talent is an innate gift. A gift that was generously bestowed on Casey Moreton as is evidenced in this- his very first novel.The Vice President of the United States makes a videotape confession just prior to resigning. However, before he could make the announcement of his resignation, a sniper's bullet ends his life. The videotape, however, is already in the mail. Shadowy government agents are on the trail of the tape and wreak death and destruction in their wake. The assassin, St. John, wants out of the killing life as he has fallen in love with Megan. He wants nothing more than the five million dollars he is owed and to live a normal life. In the meantime, Joel Benjamin is about to kill himself in an airport until he sees the face of his long lost daughter, Megan. He tries to unsuccessfully to follow her. His life's mission now becomes finding her. Of course, all of these characters' paths must continuously interweave in a death's dance to the very end.THE GREATER GOOD is a truly remarkable debut thriller. Casey Moreton is a superb and inspired storyteller and with so many mediocre books being published, this is a relatively rare feat. The characters are cleverly conceived and skillfully portrayed. Alternating point of view heightens suspense and adds additional fuel to the already brisk pacing. With a compelling story and a highly satisfying conclusion, this is one of the most entertaining books of the year.

One of the greatest police procedural series is the 87th Precinct novels of the legendary Ed McBain. The first one was written in 1956. It was a straightforward novel with one relatively simple storyline. Today's volumes are conciderably longer with several distinct subplots that intertwine with the various characters. They are much more complex and character rich novels. They might be rarely equaled by current writers but never surpassed in pure writing style.In this, the 52nd book in the series, Fat Ollie Weeks, a crude and rude detective of the 88th Precinct has just completed a detective novel. He has the manuscript stolen off the back seat of his car while investigating a crime. The case he is given is the assasination of a politician who may very well have been a candidate for mayor. Fat Ollie solicits help on the high publicity case from Steve Carella of the 87th Precinct. Fat Ollie not only wants to solve the crime, he also wants to get his manuscript back.McBain uses much humor in telling this multifaceted story. The murder of the politician is compelling enough. However, we also meet some of the dregs of society as Fat Ollie trails his book. Characters are superbly portrayed- many of which are old friends to those of us who have followed the series. McBain, once again proves that after almost a half century, he has not lost his touch.

One of the most eagerly awaited novels this year is the latest by Bob Crais. It is another in the Elvis Cole series. Bob has taken a hiatus from the series in which he wrote two stand alones. However, Carol Starkey, the FBI heroine of DEMOLITION ANGEL returns.Elvis is watching Ben Chenier, the ten year old son of Elvis' girlfriend, Lucy Chenier. While playing in the back of Elvis' house, Ben is kidnapped. The person who abducted Ben calls and blames the kidnapping on revenge for something Elvis did in Vietnam. Working with his partner, the mysterious Joe Pike, as well as, Carol Starkey of the FBI, Cole will stop at nothing to get Ben back safely.A riveting plot, overall strong characterizations and realistic descriptions make this one of the more gripping reads of the year. There is not much new or original in the ideas used in the story. Kidnappings have a vast representation in the mystery and crime genre. The plot of this book really is nothing special. It is the use of familiar sympathetic characters and the smooth lyrical writing that sets this work apart. THE LAST DETECTIVE should prove hugely popular with the book buying public. It is good to see Elvis Cole and friends back again.

Jim Christensen is a psychologist who must try to delve into the damaged mind of Teresa Hartnett. Teresa was the victim of a severe beating and brutal rape six years ago. Her head injuries were so severe that her skull was crushed adversely affecting her memory. Now, Carmen DellaVecchio, the man who was convicted based on her testimony is being released when newly discovered DNA evidence tends to exonerate him. Teresa begins to doubt her own memory and seeks Jim's help to discover the truth. The problem is Jim's girlfriend, Brenna Kennedy, is the DellaVecchio's defense attorney and is mainly responsible for his release. However, things turn quite ominous when both Teresa and Brenna begin receiving threatening calls.Martin J. Smith can certainly tell a terrifying tale. The reader is quickly drawn into the captivating plot. Characters, as a whole, appear very much true to life. The author makes good use of the Pittsburgh locale. However, it is a clunky exposition that pulls all the loose threads together. Martin J. Smith is a talented writer who has written a book well worthy of the Edgar award in this category.

UTOPIA, Lincoln Child's only novel that he authored alone concerned an imaginary theme park- the ultimate in technology. In effect, it is a warning of what can happen when technology goes unchecked. It is a wildly suspenseful book and also provides some key insights into the thought, creation and running of a theme park. Now, with his second solo authored novel, he explores another imaginary technology and what can happen if human intervention goes too far.Christopher Lash is a former FBI forensic psychologist with a busy private practice in New York. He is hired as a special consultant by Eden, a company that specializes in dating services. However, not just any dating service. For a $25,000 fee, the client is put through a barrage of physical, psychological and emotional testing. The data is put into a super computer and a match would be made from the thousands of other applicants. Their success rate is near perfect as most couples match upwards of 98%. However, Lash is asked to look into the double suicide of a perfect 100% match. There does not appear to be precursors that would indicate why the couple decided to commit suicide. Things heat up considerably when the second perfect match turns up dead from another double suicide. Lash must get to the bottom of this before more couples turn up dead.DEATH MATCH is another fun and exciting read. The positives of this novel include the pacing which is relentless and the plot which is imaginative. Characters, though not filled with great depth, are quite serviceable for this type of an entertainment. The major negative is the needless depth and endless description of the technology. Page after page of psychological testing parameters are covered as is the computer technology used to run the company. This information could and should have been greatly edited. However, by skimming these sections, the reader will move quickly through to the exciting climax and somewhat predictable conclusion. Fun for a day at the beach.

David Liss, author of the Edgar award winning, A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, has once again penned a compelling yet authentic mystery that takes place in 18th century London. Benjamin Weaver is a private investigator who finds himself convicted of murder and sentenced to be hung after a man is discovered dead at the site of a bar fight. Weaver was investigating a threatening letter sent to a priest when he was apparently at the wrong place and time. He is, of course, innocent yet is sent to the gallows by a corrupt judge. As he is heading to the prison, a mysterious woman passes a lockpick to him and Weaver manages to escape. Given that he is sentenced to hang, he must discover who framed him and why in order to clear his name. His search for answers leads him into the convoluted web of British parliamentary politics in which the election is termed 'the spectacle of corruption'. He must use every ounce of his cunning to discover the truth and save his own life.With the SPECTACLE OF CORRUPTION, David Liss has managed to create a complex yet compelling historical mystery. Characters are realistic creations but the problem is there are so many minor ones that, at times, it may be hard to keep track of who is who. However, the main characters are original and memorable. The plot with a bit too much complexity tends to meander and there's a certain lack of focus. Weaver appears to travel around and around in circles trying to get answers. This is not a fast read in any sense of the word. However it is all encompassing and so well written that the casual reader would find the time well worth spent.

The year is 79 AD and the place is the Bay of Naples. The flow of water from the aquaducts have been interrupted leaving several towns without any water supply. It is up to the engineer, Marius Attilius Primus, who is in charge of the proper functioning of the aquaduct, to find out what happened. The problem is a potential catastrophe in that the water has been interrupted to over a quarter of a million people. In addition, sulpher gases have begun to appear from underground conduits and minor earthquakes have become more numerous. Attiilus soon fears an eruption of nearby Mt. Vesuvius. He must go to Pompeii for men and supplies to attempt to repair the aquaduct until his fears prove to be real.Using an aquaduct engineer as a main protagonist is an original and inspired idea. This proves to be an excellent way to highlight the politics and city life at the time off the eruption. The problem with the book was that the plot was not thrilling enough to keep the pages turning. Interesting but not thrilling.

Precious Ramotswe, founder of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana is faced with several problems in this, the fourth and latest volume of the international best-selling series by Mr. Smith. First of all, Mma. Ramotswe has competition when another detective agency comes into town run by a man who feels women are second rate. His credentials are a bit suspect. I.e.. He claims to have had detective training in some large cities including New York. Second, her assistant, Mma. Makutsi, has started a typing school for men and has met a wonderful man who claims to love her. The question is who is he and is he trustworthy. These problems will all be solved prior to the ending of this delightful little novel.The term "cozy" was made for this type of book. There is no bloodletting or violence of any kind. It is purely character driven and what charming and polite characters they are! The books are slight enough that we get to know the characters, the problems they must solve, and the resolution before the book ends in a length perfect for one sitting. I fully understand the popularity of these books. They remind the reader of the Golden Age of mystery fiction.

Deputy DA Samantha Kincaid of Portland Oregon is faced with a particularly disturbing case. A thirteen year old girl is found raped, sodomized and left for dead in the woods outside of town. The girl, Kendra Martin, identifies her attacker as Frank Derringer. With that evidence the case is brought to trial. However, with flimsy evidence, Samantha sees pitfalls ahead as she goes against an idealistic and aggressive public defender. As the complexity of the case reveals itself, Samantha actually finds herself in imminent danger.Alafair Burke, daughter of MWA Grand master James Lee Burke, has written a very different book than the lyrically beautiful writing of her father. I don't mean this in a negative sense. Alafair Burke is a law professor and, like Samantha, a former DA in Portland. The book is character driven. With much influence from Sue Grafton, Sara Paretsky, Nevada Barr and Laura Lippmann to name a few, the character of Samantha is the key to everything. We must, of course, know everything about her including her preferences in food and love. She must have the obligatory pet, live alone, have a lover etc. In spite of the fact that this book is not of my personal taste, there is much promising about this debut writer. She delves into the personality of Samantha Kincaid with vigor in first person narrative. The character is dead on. I wonder if it is the author herself we are getting to know. The conclusion is complex with the obligatory exposition scene of the villain holding the gun over the hero while divulging all. Yet, it is deftly handled. Overall, recommended with mild reservation.

A young child's humerus is found by a dog on a hillside in Hollywood. A closer search reveals a more complete skeleton. Harry Bosch and his partner Edgar are assigned this case in which the murder is believed to have occurred over twenty years ago. His investigation resurrects painful memories of a dysfunctional family while driving another to consider suicide. In the midst of the case, Bosch manages to possibly find love. Can any form of happiness last for this tortured soul?Harry Bosch is the prototypical modern fictional crime fighter. He is a direct descendant of Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade. Bosch is today's dark knight, lone wolf or, to use Mike Connelly's simile, The Last Coyote. He is also the one of greatest creations in the history of crime fiction. Many of us have repeatedly extolled the virtues of the writing of Mike Connelly. He is simply the very best of today's fictional crime writers. Readers should take note of the incredibly smooth lyrical writing. There is much personal angst Bosch suffers and this is so well conveyed through dialogue and other characters. Los Angeles has never looked more bleak than in the pages of this brilliant book. With each successive work, Mike Connelly continuously raises the ante in reaching new levels of excellence. This work is no exception. Read it.

Reading books by Christopher Reich is becoming a habit. His first book, NUMBERED ACCOUNT was nominated for an Edgar Award. This is actually a very rare feat for a thriller novel. THE RUNNER also is a very well written thriller and now Christopher Reich returns to the world of high finance with another well received and highly publicized novel.John &quot;Jett&quot; Gavallan is the CEO of Black Jet Securities, a firm of investment bankers. He senses a lucrative deal with a Russian businessman, Konstantin Kirov. Mr. Kirov wants to bring his internet company, Mercury Broadband public. The profits for Jett's company could go into the hundreds of millions. Kirov, of course can earn many billions. After the proper due diligence, everything looks good until a mysterious net columnist begins pointing out hidden problems with the company that Jett is not aware of. Things turn ominous when Grafton Byrnes, a friend of Jett's goes to Russia to investigate the company and disappears. As Jett investigates, he realizes he and his company are definitely in trouble.The world of high finance is where Christopher Reich feels most comfortable. He is was an international banker in Europe and utilized that knowledge in his first book, as well as, this current volume. What is especially impressive about Mr. Reich's work is that, in spite of the complexity of the topic he is discussing (in this case IPOs) he is never heavy-handed in his approach to the subject. The reader will not feel overwhelmed while being swept up into the action of the story. All of the stock thriller elements are here-- the hero with a military background adept at the use of firearms, the tough heroine to team up with him, a villain with grandiose ideas of world domination and exotic locales. The breakneck speed Reich eventually builds up to makes the very long book appear much shorter. Reich is quickly establishing himself as a superior writer of financial thrillers. A very entertaining work.

McDermid is the author of several series including one with serial killer profiler, Tony Hill and DCI Carol Jordan first introduced in the superb THE MERMAIDS SINGING. This current book is the third one in the series.Two storyline threads interweave themselves into this compelling plot. Carol is offered the bone of a possible promotion if she would agree to an undercover assignment. The assignment concerns getting to know and possibly date a criminal in Germany who imports illegal immigrants from Asia, as well as, drugs. She is to gain his confidence and set him up for arrest. Of course, if her cover is blown, her life will be in imminent danger. At the same time, a serial killer is murdering psychology professors in Germany. The killings are done in a particularly gruesome manner. Tony Hill is on the trail.Val McDermid is a superb storyteller. She succeeds in creating full rich characters that illicit a great deal of empathy with the reader. The parallel plots work quite well together and greatly heighten suspense to the degree that the book simply cannot be put down. This is another strong recommendation for one of our best writers working today.

Lindsey Davis is the author of the hugely popular series about Marcus Didius Falco, her detective from the first century, AD. This episode, occurring in 75AD relocates Falco and his family to Londinium, the Roman London of today. A hemchman of a tribal king is found drowned in a barrel. This places the Roamns in a diplomatic quandry as they must discover the murderer to satisfy the king. Falco is called upon to solve the crime. His investigation takes him to the dregs of this early settlement where we are treated to a virtual tour of London, 75AD.This is the second year in a row that Lindsey Davis has been nominated for the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger, an award she previously received. The problem that I had with the last book was a feeling that there was a general lack of authenticity. The characters and the locale was so remniscent of today that it just as well could have been a modern crime novel. This is almost certainly intentional on the part of the author. This is not the problem at all with this current volume. Londinium is described in loving detail. The early Londoner's recreation, entertainment, living arrangements, bars, shops are all rendered with care. What was perceived by myself as the major weakness of the last book is the major strength of this one. Characters are well known to the readers of the series including Falco's family. They are very well rendered and are another strength of this work. The major weakness is the tepid plot that barely holds this book together as we plod through the pages endlessly progressing to the uninspiring conclusion. I am not yet a fan of this series.

Florida is hardly the place one would look to find the hotbed of violence and hatred that was the Ku Klux Klan in 1951. However, as Susan Carol McCarthy tells us in her highly effective debut novel, at that time, it was. Reesa McMahon's nightmare begins in spring of that year when a nineteen year old black youth named Marvin Cully is killed. Marvin was her friend and worked as citrus picker in her father's orange grove. This event sets off a wave of violence throughout the state. Bombs explode and people are killed as far south as Miami. The NAACP and FBI get involved and eventually Reesa's father, Warren, is involved as a sympathizer for the blacks. This leads to an eventual clash between Warren and the local black community versus the KKK.Susan Carol McCarthy displays a prodigious talent at writing realistic historical fiction. There is much to be admired in this work. The civil rights era is brought fully to life in her hands. There is a great sense of place in that the reader could almost smell the fragrant citrus groves of this small central Florida town. However, most impressive of all is her depiction of the characters. They are both empathetic and realistic including the dialogue they speak. In a sense, it is a coming of age novel. It represents a clash between childhood innocence and the harsh realities of the adult world comprised of racial bigotry and hatred. Remnicent of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, LAY THAT TRUMPET IN OUR HANDS is a microcosmic saga that reveals the triumph of good over evil in the framework of a small southern town. Highly recommended.

Once again Sean Dillon must come to the rescue. After the deaths of his adversaries, the Rashid family, Dillon now faces Baron von Berger and his illegitimate son, Marco Rossi, who have remaining interest in the Rashid fortune. Von Berger wants revenge and will stop at nothing. He has in his possession the actual diary of Adolph Hitler that can potentially wreak havoc on the leadership of the free world and threatens to use it. Dillon must stop him while trying to save himself.Jack Higgins continues to write spare direct novels that get right to the point. In one quick sentence he announces the death of a main character- no emotion- no build up. With thriller writers today writing bulky tomes, it would seem to be almost refreshing to read a shorter work. However, Higgins may go a bit too far. A word of caution- the book picks up on MIDNIGHT RUNNER and if the reader hasn't read at least that far back, they may be a bit confused as to what is happening. However, Jack Higgins remains an icon and a noted practitioner of the art of the thriller.

Thomas Perry is very well known for his riveting thrillers. In some ways, he is highly underrated in that his books are so good, he should be a very well known best-selling author. He has been putting out quality work for years. His latest is no exception and is, in fact, one of his best in quite some time.PURSUIT, as the title aptly describes, is a novel about a cat and mouse chase between two killers. Both of them are professionals for hire. However, one of them works for the good guys, the other is a true monster. When thirteen bodies turn up dead in an intimate restaurant, Daniel Milliken, ex-detective and current professor of criminology, realizes one of the dead customers was the target of a highly skilled and dangerous assassin. He has one of the victim's families hire Roy Prescott, who specializes in hunting down murderers and, in most instances, killing them. Prescott's target is James Varney, an assassin for hire who has no regard for human life. Prescott sets up one trap after another to ensnare Varney. However, Varney eventually starts setting traps of his own.Perry specializes in novels about hide and seek. His series character, Jane Whitefield, makes people disappear by changing their identity. This standalone is again about people trying to disappear. The book takes off from page one and rarely pauses for breath. These types of books make for some fun reading and this one is definitely no exception. Not only does Perry take great care in the construction of the plot of this novel, but, he uses the same care in the creation of his characters. Varney, Prescott and Milliken are all real to the reader by the conclusion of this ingenious work.

Mickey Haller, defense attorney in LA, has no office but is driven around town in a black Lincoln. Hence the name 'Lincoln Lawyer'. It is, in fact, his office. He defends all forms of low life including drug dealers and prostitutes.He is always on the lookout for a so-called franchise client- one who can pay a large legal fee and keep on coming back. He thinks he might have one when he is asked by a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate agent, Louis Roulet to defend him after Roulet is charged for the brutal beating of a prostitute. Haller agrees thinking of the huge payout. But, things start taking a turn for the worst when Roulet's connection to Haller might be much more than it ominously appears.The year 2005 is a fortuitous one for Mike Connolly fans. Two books out in the same year. Both are excellent. Mike has proven a modern master of the detective novel, police procedural, thriller and now legal thriller. The book is greatly detailed and much research has gone into it. There is great care taken in descriptions of the trial and, of course, there is the usual Connolly twist at the end. In spite of an unfortunate confession that really made no sense just before the onset of the trial, the reader will be treated to a realistic and carefully constructed tale and, as always, another must read of the year.

A death in Vienna starts the action in this seventh thriller by Daniel Silva. The Wartime Claims and Inquiries Office is destroyed by a bomb. The reason for the killing is that apparently an old man contacted the office after claiming to have seen an old SS officer now going by the name Ludwig Vogel. As Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Radek, Vogel is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews in W.W.II. Vogel is now a very wealthy industrialist in Austria. The Israeli government calls into action Gabriel Allon, their assassin who also works as an art restorer, to look into the accusation. Hampering their investigation are Vogel's henchmen who have no hesitation in killing Allon to save Vogel. However, Allon's true motivation to bring Vogel to justice lies in his own past.Daniel Silva is one of the finest thriller writers currently working. His books are all compulsive reads filled with high octane thrills. However, one cannot get over the feeling that this book is his first stumble. According the author's note, "A DEATH IN VIENNA is actually the third book in a cycle dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust. Nazi art looting and the collaboration of Swiss banks served as the backdrop for THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN. The role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and the silence of Pope Pius XII inspired THE CONFESSOR." The current book is also based loosely on real events. However, in the previous books the historical events flowed from the action. This gave the books a greater sense of spontaneity. In this book, the real events dictate the progression of the book. This tends to make the plot and pacing appear too artificial and predictable. It is a much more contrived work. There really is no true character development and all of this has been covered before in both popular and 'serious' fiction.

Everything is going right in Jake Conason's life. He is a college student at Washington University in St. Louis. He has a beautiful girlfriend who he is very serious about and plans to marry. He is a popular member of a fraternity yet manages to take school serious, has excellent grades and is an excellent prospect for one of the top law schools in the country. Everything is going right until one fateful night when he commits an indiscretion then a horrific crime. To keep his future prospects intact, Jake must do all he can to cover it up-- even if it takes murder.Cornell Woolrich wannabe, Andrew Lyons has managed to hit a home run his first time at bat. The plight of antihero Jake Conason is so compelling that the book is virtually impossible to put down. The well paced and clever plot lacks originality but makes up for it in pure fun. This is the type of suspenseful thriller that few debut novelists attempt to write. So many of these first time authors write amateur detective stories that they are difficult to distinguish from each other and most are quite forgettable. Perhaps this type of suspense tale is very difficult to construct. However, the ending lacked originality and any semblence of realism. This marred an otherwise excellent debut effort.

In England, 1929, Maisie Dobbs sets herself up as a private investigator in London. Previously she has worked as a housemaid, as well as a nurse during the Great War in France. The country is still reeling from the shock of the catastrophic loss of almost a whole generation of young men. Her first case involves a man who suspects his wife of infidelity. Investigation of the case leads Maisie to The Retreat, a convalescent home for severely wounded soldiers. However, things at The Retreat are not all that they seem to be.Jacqueline Winspear manages to lend a strong sense of reality to the historical setting of her debut novel. Interestingly, the construction of the novel is in three parts. The first part introduces us to the heroine and her first investigation. The second part of the book takes us back ten years before the war and Maisie's upward mobility from the position of a housemaid to student to nurse. While part three concerns the matter related to The Retreat. Without a doubt the strength of the book is the vivid realism of the descriptions of the people and places of England between the wars. Not since Charles Todd created his wonderful Rutledge series have we been treated to such an auspicious and original new historical series of this time period. The book's major weakness is the tepid and predictable mystery of The Retreat.This is a book that will receive much accolades and should be on the short list of all the major awards. Highly recommended.

Ridley Jones is a freelance writer who, at the beginning of this well crafted thriller, finds herself trapped inexplicably in the basement of a derelict building in lower Manhattan pursued by a group of men who want to do her harm. She has six bullets left in her gun and they are coming to get her. How she landed herself in this improbable predicament is the essence of this suspense thriller as we travel back to the time when Ridley becomes a national celebrity for saving a young child from being hit by a truck. With her face posted everywhere, someone contacts her claiming that she is his daughter. As Ridley questions her past, she realizes her whole life has been a lie.Lisa Unger (formerly Lisa Miscione) is a very talented storyteller. She has an innate ability to create some strong female heroines. Ridley is a remarkably ordinary person forced into extraordinary circumstances beyond her control. The plot itself is quite riveting and I could not put the book down over the course of the single day it was read. The problem is that the book is overwritten. There are excessive descriptions with some that are quite clumsy. ("There was something ugly about his face. There was a cold meanness to his aura.") Other descriptions are pointless such as the depictions of daily minutia. (Do we really need to know she ordered a coffee and pastry while passing through a Barnes and Noble?) This bulks up the book unnecessarily and slows down the plot. Yet, Lisa Unger tells such a compelling tale that all the excessives can be forgiven.

Harlan Coben, Robert Crais, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane and DonWinslow were all well established mystery authors with successful highly acclaimed series when they wrote their first stand alone. The result was that they all hit the big time and the national bestseller lists. William Kent Krueger has been a favorite for years with his Cork O'Connor mystery series. Now he joins this August crowd by writing a stand alone and it is every bit as good and entertaining as the others.Secret Service agent Bo Thorsen is assigned to protect the First Lady, Kate Dixon, when she heads back to her home in Minnesota after her father is injured in a farming accident. Unbeknownst to Bo, she is targeted by a mysterious killer who bears a grudge against her. At the same time, her husband, President Clay Dixon, is up for reelection and needs Kate's help with the campaign. Due to his apparent lack of moral fortitude, Kate has left her husband. This can fatally damage his campaign. One of the President's advisors look upon her as a liability and want to do something about it without the President's knowledge. Bo is up against, not only the battle of his career, but, of his life.William Kent Krueger's fast and furious debut thriller appears headed for bestseller stardom. Impressive characterizations and a tricky plot with may twists and turns make this another winner. The plot, although it occasionally loses focus, is always entertaining. Highly recommended.

When one thinks of the character of James Bond, immediately the image carefully constructed over almost forty years in the motion picture industry comes to mind. However, this is not the James Bond of the many novels most recently written by Raymond Benson. He is more of a reserved gentleman albeit a ladies man, however, nowhere near the extent he is on the big screen. He also takes a heck of a pounding by the bad guys who are not quite so over the top. He is a bit less of a superman.In this installment Bond is ordered to travel to Japan to help provide security for the many world leaders at the G8 summit conference. However, he is also asked to look into the deaths of a prominent family all of whom died quite suddenly of a mysterious ailment. As Bond investigates with his friend, Tiger Tanaka, they discover a plot with a unique but potent weapon that could place many lives at risk at the G8 summit.One-dimensional characters and a plot that for much of the book plods along, make this a less than stellar entry into the Bond series. Any sense of originality that the books possessed has worn thin for many years. Yet, Bond remains a very popular hero and, with the continued success of the motion pictures, we can expect the books to keep on coming no matter who writes them.

If I were ever to write a book I would want to write a suspense novel about a normal person caught up into a life and death struggle beyond their control. Twists and turns of the plot would be a prerequisite with surprises galore. I would take great pains in creating the main character as the neighbor next store- no special forces agent or high powered political bigwig- just the sort of person who worries about making dinner for the family or having the time to go to the kid's soccer game. Yes, books just like what Harlan Coben currently writes.In this latest thriller, average housewife, Grace Lawson is picking up photos from her local photo developing stand. The packet, however, contains an old photo purportedly of her husband, Jack, and several other people. When she shows it to her husband, he denies that it is him. Yet, that night he disappears. Grace is determined to find out what happened to Jack. Her search takes her directly into the path of a killing machine called Eric Wu (who the reader might remember from TELL NO ONE, however, this time sans the even more terrifying Larry Gandle). At stake is not only her own life but those of her husband and children.Harlan has, once again, penned a novel that reaches to the underlying terror that lies deep in the heart of every person. JUST ONE LOOK has as its main protagonist a female ( a bit of a change for Harlan). He explores how a simple event like picking up family photos can lead into something way beyond what an average person faces. Characters are thoughtfully created with such care that even those with only minutes left to live are fully realized with complete pasts. (Eric Wu, however, is a bit of a stretch.)Harlan, for many years, has written an excellent series starring Myron Bolitar, a sports agent cum PI. They were amusing books but all of them had a bite to them. They were definitely not about sports. Now Harlan is into these standalones of which JUST ONE LOOK is the fourth. TELL NO ONE is definitely his breakout book and catapulted him onto the bestseller lists internationally. He has a lucrative contract way beyond his wildest dreams and legions of readers. These books are good and solid entertainments. They are well worth purchasing and reading on planes and by the pool. I would compare his work to that of Cornell Woolrich --the everyman placed into a perilous situation. However, I still feel his best work lies in the old Bolitar series. It was in that setting that he so effectively probed the darkness that lies in the heart of man. I know he has one or two more books to write on this current contract. However, I hope he goes back to his roots by writing about truly sympathetic characters that use self deprecating humor as a means of combating life threatening danger. You wouldn't know it by reading these books but Harlan is a very funny man. As his readership grows, however, I really don't see that happening.

It seems like every year one of the Edgar committees rescues from obscurity a previously unknown undiscovered work. Many times these works are true gems in the rough uncut state. The nominations tend to bring some prominence to authors most of whom would probably never have been heard from again. For example KJA Wishnia and Margaret Moseley. GUN MONKEYS is that kind of book and Victor Gischler is that kind of author.Charlie Swift is a thug. He is a hit man for an Orlando gangster named Stan. When the leader of a rival gang wants to move into the territory, he calls for a hit on all of Stan's gang. The result is virtually all of Charlie's friends are killed in the attack. Stan, however, is missing and being the loyal soldier, Charlie devotes his energy into finding Stan and discovering what is going on. The path to the truth will be strewn with the blood of dead bodies.Victor Gischler is a refreshingly new voice in noir crime fiction. Characters are tough, dialogue is gritty and the violence routine. Most important, he is a helluva good storyteller and his first effort never fails to entertain. The book is not perfect, however. There are several times the story proceeds in an endless fashion and it is quite evident the author didn't know where his characters were taking him. I would think that an editor from a large publisher would have identified and corrected that problem. Nonetheless, Victor Gischler has written an impressive book and one well worthy of Edgar recognition.

LOOKS COULD KILL by Kate WhiteWarner Books, 2002 $22.95 0-446-53023-9This debut novel by COSMOPOLITAN editor in chief Kate White arrived in the bookstores with much advance buzz. I was afraid that the buzz would be based on who the author is rather than the actual merits of the book. Given the plethora of superb mystery novels being published by authors who are themselves not celebrities, as well as, the fact that this novel is merely ordinary, my fears are well realized.Bailey Wiggins is a true crime writer who works for "Gloss" magazine one of the major woman's magazines. She is called one Sunday morning to Cat Jones' NYC apartment. Cat is the editor and chief of "Gloss". The problem is that Cat has gotten no response from her child's live in nanny, Heidi, who appears to be at home in her apartment but is not answering her phone or door. Bailey is asked to come over and investigate. Heidi is soon discovered dead-poisoned, apparently, by chocolates intended for Cat. The murder might be similar to the recent death of an editor at another magazine. Could there be a connection? Cat asks Bailey to investigate.When a celebrity decides to write a mystery the question must arise as to why?Perhaps it could be to attempt to explain what their life is like or to give an insider's view into a certain industry be it entertainment, politics, warfare, law etc. They might have a favorite agenda to push such as environmental or medical concerns. The hope is the individual will succeed in, not only pushing their agenda, but, in writing a solid and entertaining mystery. Kate White has managed to put together a competent book. Actually, it is quite good considering that writing fiction is not what she does for a living. Her mystery is relatively routine and offers nothing unique to the habitual mystery reader. Characters range from highly stereotypic to the somewhat interesting. In reading this book, there is little to be learned about the world of the glamour glossy magazines. Kate White simply did not adequately use her background as one would expect given that Cat is very much based on herself. However, Ms. White's prose flows quite smoothly through the pages and the story is entertaining enough. However, the mystery aficionados will probably not be fully satisfied.

Robert Mallon, in his forties and retired in affluence for ten years, is stolling along a beach near his home in Santa Barbara, California. He sees a young woman enter the water and not return. He proceeds to save her from drowning. In the few subsequent hours, they develope a relationship. However, the next day, Mallon hears of the young woman's death. He wonders what drove her to suicide and looks into her past. He hires a friend, PI Lydia Marks, to look into this stranger's death. They soon find themselves up against a network of assasins run by a paramilitary leader named Parrish. He inexplicably begins to hunt Mallon in a game to the death.DEAD AIM is one of the weakest novels written by Thomas Perry in years. The plot lacks any real basis in reality. Mallon is a less than inspirational hero which leads to a lack of reader empathy. Stereotypic characters abound in this predictable and silly tale.

One of the most timely books published recently concerns an assassination attempt on the US President by Middle Eastern terrorists sent by Saddam Hussein. The fear is that Saddam has the bomb and, in a last desperate move, wants to use it against either the US or Israel. The result could be a nuclear holocaust. The President tags his friend, Wall Street wonder, Jon Bennett to be part of a negotiating team sent to Israel to get them to hold off on attacking Iraq after a provocative incident. Much is at stake including millions of lives.Joel C. Rosenberg's debut novel sets into motion a nightmare scenario which is, unfortunately, all too probable. It is the realism of the situation that is the major strength of this work. In the initial part of the book, the author shows himself to be a skilled novelist in terms of setting up a deadly situation and pacing the reader through it in such a way as to maximize suspense and virtually keep the pages flying. However, in the second half, the plot, the characters and the situation are a bit too over the top requiring some major suspension of belief in reality. It, overall, paints a bleak picture of the Iraq crisis. Let's hope this remains only a part of the fertile imagination of this political strategist and debut author.

Eric Moore is happy with his life. He has a family, good business and beautiful home. He has all this until that fateful day when his teenage son, Keith, babysits an eight year old named Amy Giordano. The next morning, Amy disappears. Of course, all eyes turn to Keith including those of his father who fears the guilt of his son. Keith claims innocence but there is no other true suspect. The truth must come out at all costs. But the answer might lie in the long gone past of Eric's own disjointed family. He will search his past to find out the truth of today.I have said again and again that Thomas H. Cook is one of the very best writers of suspense fiction in the world. His books wring every bit of tension by creating a harrowing situation for an every man who must search his past for long lost answers. The reader never discovers the truth until the last few pages and the truth is always shocking. I have personally purchased BREAKHEART HILL for complete strangers in bookstores if they promised to read the book. Tom Cook has written in many styles. His early works are superb detective novels. He has written historical suspense novels including the Edgar winning THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR, as well as, the modern psychological suspense dramas like RED LEAVES.RED LEAVES is one of his very best works. Quite possibly as good as BREAKHEART HILL. It is a book that demands to be read in a single sitting. Tom Cook is a master of pacing, characterizations and lyrical writing. In fact, when I think of the most talented writers in the crime fiction field, his name always comes to mind. Any reader who is not familiar with Tom's books would do well starting with this one- one of his finest in years. If I owned a bookstore, I would give a money back guarantee with this one. Truly great!

The Amber Room is one of history's greatest treasures. It disappeared from the Soviet Union during W.W.II. It is worth a fortune and is actively being sought after by two collectors of stolen art, Ernest Loring and Franz Fellner. Through their loyal assassins and employees, Christian Knoll for Fellner and Suzanne Danzer for Loring, they dangerously battle each other for clues to the room's location. Their search takes them to Atlanta, Georgia where Karol Borya lives. Karol is said to know something about the location of the Amber Room. A secret he has kept from his daughter, Judge Rachel Cutler. When Karol dies suspiciously, Rachel travels to Europe to seek answers. Pursuing her is her ex-husband Paul who wants to protect her while Knoll and Danzer want to do her harm. Unknowingly, Rachel walks into a fatally dangerous situation.THE AMBER ROOM is an epic thriller. It is very well done with all the elements that make it an excellent example of what is good in the sub genre. Characters are well developed but exaggerated as would be proper to make them larger than life. Exotic locales throughout Europe give the aire of elegance The villains are evil and will stop at nothing to possess the Amber Room. The problem with this debut effort is the sheer volume of the book. To call it merely lengthy would be an exaggeration. The book has weight- much of it excessive. The plot, though written with a rapid pacing, meanders. Mr. Berry, however, has written a superior thriller and with some tightening of his plot should prove to be a highly successful thriller writer. He is definitely one to watch.

DEAD HEAT by Caroline Carver (Orion, 17.99)Georgia Parish, a bookseller, is in Nugarra, Far Northern Queensland to attend the funeral of her grandfather. She is to travel home by a small plane. However, the plane crashes but Georgia survives. Suzie, a fellow passenger gives Georgia a bag containing a computer disc and as her dying wish, asks her to give it to Suzie's brother. Georgia also meets Lee on the flight, a mysterious man who saves her life yet remains enigmatic. As it becomes known that Georgia has the disc, she is placed in increasing danger including having her life threatened by a Chinese gang desperate to get their hands on Suzie's brother. Georgia must get to the bottom of the mystery to save not only her own life but that of her mother's.Caroline Carver has written a compelling thriller that never lets up on the suspense and even manages to throw a few curves to the reader just as the story begins to wind down. Length is a bit of a problem as the story goes on a bit too long. Yet, competently created characters, a fast paced plot and excellent sense of locale raise the book above the merely ordinary.

There are certain historical novels that are so large and all encompassing that they not only evoke a time and place but truly place the reader realistically in its midst. Immediately coming to mind are the Dickens books that were contemporary when they were written but are considered historical to the present readers. A contemporary book such as THE QUINCUNX by Charles Palliser (who also wrote a testimonial for this work) also comes to mind. Andrew Taylor admirably succeeds in recreating both London and the British countryside of 1819 and peoples the book with enough shadowy and colorful characters to make the trip very worthwhile.The narrative we are reading is that of Thomas Shield, a tutor at a private school of Stoke Newington. He comes across a child named Charles Frant who is a targeted by the other students as a scapegoat until another young man appears by the name of Edgar Allen. Edgar, by fighting the other students wins a certain amount of respect for himself and for Charles, as well. It is soon thereafter that while walking in the neighborhood, Thomas witnesses an inebriated man accosting the two boys. He rescues them from the situation and a grateful Henry Frant, father of Charles invites Thomas to come to the house as a tutor. So begins the long tale of Thomas' intertwined relationships with this household.Andrew Taylor is a unique author of many talents. This very large epic novel follows close on the heels of the wonderful Roth trilogy. There is much good in this current work. The strength of any historical novel is the ability of the author to bring the era to life with a compelling and intriguing story. With that he readily succeeds. A problem, however, is that he takes so darn long to get through it. When we finally reach the end, the exposition must be extremely lengthy and complex. THE AMERICAN BOY has won the CWA Ellis Peters Dagger for historical mysteries. It is an award well deserved.

Jack Reacher, a nomadic doer of good deeds, makes his seventh appearance in one of the hottest thrillers of the summer season. His latest adventure has him going undercover into the household of a purported drug dealer in an effort to catch him in the act of transacting a deal. Of course, the good are in danger and the bad will die.There is really nothing profound about the Reacher novels. They are quite simply about a man trying to &quot;do the right thing&quot;. Reacher is unable to live with any kinds of roots, therefore, he wanders from one difficult situation to the next. They are all quite excellent and satisfying reads. This current one is no exception-- well plotted with rapid fire pacing and characters that, in spite of their comic book appeal, will long linger in the minds of the readers. You will need little persuading to read PERSUADER.

Sometimes testimonials and covers can backfire. Unless the reader is a fan of the author writing the testimonial, they might be inclined to turn down reading the book thinking it is similar to the style of the testimonial writer. For example, Tim Dorsey wrote the front cover testimonial of this Edgar nominated debut effort of Ben Rehder. Dorsey compares Rehder to Hiaasen. Personally I don't like Tim Dorsey's books and Hiaasen is all right in limited doses. The only reason I picked up Buck Fever is the fact that it is a nominated book. Somewhat surprisingly, it is an edgy, crime novel that would be considered mildly comic at best-- nothing like Dorsey or Hiaason. It is a very good debut effort.In Blanco County, Texas-- near Austin, it is a week before the start of deer hunting season. Things are gearing up at the Circle S ranch where they are about to let loose the high-paying hunters on their stock of deer. A couple of poachers trying to get a jump on the hunters shoot a deer and are surprised to see it is a man dressed up in a deer costume. Trey Sweeney, the man in the deer costume, is biologist doing field work and is a personal friend of Game Warden John Marlin. Marlin looks into the matter and notices a buck exhibiting odd behavior. He subdues the buck and brings it to the local vet to be examined. However, the buck is stolen after the vet is assaulted. Marlin wants to find out why. His investigation places him directly into the sights of some highly unsavory characters who certainly will kill without hesitating.Ben Rehder is being billed as &quot;the funniest crime writer in Texas&quot;. Let me state emphatically, this book is not that funny. The characters are a bit over the top but really no more so than many other debut writers. Rehder might have been trying to write a somewhat satirical novel about the deer hunting industry. Instead he wrote a compelling character rich atmospheric crime novel that is deserving of the Edgar nomination.

As a reviewer of first novels, it is hoped that at least once or twice a year we are sent a book that appears to have it all- great characters, compelling plot and a superb rendition of the locale. I am pleased to report all that and more is contained in this truly remarkable debut of the 2001 St. Martin's Press/Malice Domestic Award Winner, Julia Spenser-Fleming.The place is Millers Kill in upstate New York during the bleak midwinter as the title proclaims. A newborn baby is left on the steps of the local church with a note claiming the child should be given to a local couple, The Burns, who desperately want to adopt a child. Claire Fergusson, a newly ordained Episcopal priest found the child and wants to discover who the mother is. Local police chief, Russ Van Alystyne also wants to get to the bottom of the case especially when people start turning up dead. Claire and Russ make an unlikely team as they attempt to find the answers and to stop the killing as suspects abound in this small town community.Malice Domestic tends to conjure up images of cats and eccentric little old ladies in funny hats sitting around solving bloodless crimes. That is just not true. Malice Domestic refers to the traditional mystery. In this case this traditional mystery has a definite hardboiled edge. It is quite universal in its appeal. Characters are beautifully rendered and are wholly sympathetic to the reader. The relationship between the married Police Chief and the local priest is one that is quite dynamic and their mutual attraction will always be a source of conflict. The crimes are a true puzzlement and their solution quite clever. Clues come to us throughout the book and it is this that keep the pages flying. As readers of my reviews are aware, I have a problem with long expositions with the clich&eacute; of the villain telling all before a catastrophic event. This is used here. It works but I still don't like it. The book is also a bit lengthy. However, these are minor complaints when one considers how truly excellent the work is as a whole. This is definitely an early favorite for the best of the year lists.

Michael Crichton is one of the most popular authors in the world. His books sell in the millions and he has legions of fans all eagerly awaiting the latest from this author of JURASSIC PARK. What is his secret? What is the key to his popularity? Aspiring thriller writers would do well to try to answer these questions.Jack Forman is currently a stay at home dad raising three children- the youngest being an infant. He fears his wife, who works long hours and behaves suspiciously, is having an affair. That is until he learns exactly what kind of work she is involved in. Jack, a computer programmer by trade, led a group of programmers in developing a program that would create a biological process in the computer that could interact with and solve real world problems. There is an accident in the Nevada desert and Jack is called in on a temporary assignment to handle a group of nanoparticles that appear to be taking on a life of its own. The problem is the particles are programming themselves to hunt down and kill both animals and humans. They are, in effect, the predators and the humans are the prey.Once again, Michael Crichton returns to the world in which science has gone awry in a terrible but somewhat plausible way. The strength of a Crichton novel rests with the way he can move the action along while keeping the reader engrossed in the story. In the beginning we meet the main characters and set up the scientific basis for the upcoming disaster. We then proceed rather quickly into the action packed central aspect of the story. Episodes get shorter and move quicker. The last sentence of each episode almost forces the reader to keep going-- phrases such as, &quot;I'm afraid we have big problems, Jack.&quot; Or &quot;Listening to her, I couldn't help but worry.&quot;So it is a given that PREY will hold the reader's attention throughout. I had a problem with the plausibility of the nanoparticles organizing into a cohesive and destructive swarm. Their abilities appeared to be more and more outrageous as the story progressed. Characters were stereotypes, yet, adequate for this type of a book. Overall, well written and entertaining, but, lacking in any semblance of realism.

Steve Jay is a fireman-a commander who is faced with a crisis at work and at home. At work he is faced with a fatal blaze that has cost the life of a man from a prominent London family named the Sheldons. He is hired privately to investigate, not only this fire but others that concerned the family. As Jay investigates the Sheldons, he becomes personally involved in them and actually has his life threatened during the course of the investigation. His career is also threatened as a conflict of interest develops between his job as a fireman and his job as a private investigator. On the home front, his ex girlfriend has returned after a fling with another man. Should he continue their relationship?Pat O'Keeffe has written an intelligent and thoughtful novel that rises far above the typical arson terrorist adventure novel. At the beginning of the book, I had the feeling Mr. O'Keeffe was setting up a fireman vs. arsonist thriller in the same vein as Robert Crais' recent DEMOLITION ANGEL or THE FOURTH ANGEL by Suzanne Chazin-both of which were exceptionally good and entertaining. THERMAL IMAGE concerns arson, however, this is not the true essence of the story. It is a tale of murder and harkens more toward the legacy of Raymond Chandler than the action thriller sub genre. The characters are given careful consideration and their actions very well thought out. THERMAL IMAGE is a very well done debut novel and well worthy of a reader's time.

Sometimes the greatest challenge a mystery author faces is to justify why an amateur detective will feel the need to investigate a crime that is better left in the hands of the professionals. Mark de Castrique cleverly tackles this issue by having his main protagonist, Barry Clayton, an undertaker, being shot while presiding over a funeral. The killer, Dallas Willard, who was attending his grandmother's funeral appeared to go crazy killing his brother and sister just before attempting to kill Barry. The problem is that Dallas is still on the loose and Barry fears for his life. Working with his friend, Sheriff Tommy Lee Wadkins, Barry must investigate the deep dark secrets of this family to discover what exactly set Dallas off on the murderous rampage.I place a premium on originality. Sometimes novels can be so different that they are unforgettable. Unfortunately, DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING is routine and quite pedestrian. It is skillfully written and conveys a great sense of locale. However, characters, though realistic enough, are quite forgettable as is the plot. While reading this book I could never shrug off the feeling that I read this before.

One of the most original new works of fiction of this past year is THE ATHENIAN MURDERS. It is a multifaceted and multilayered novel that is much more than an historical mystery. The story concerns the translator as much as the Greek characters. Ultimately, it asks the question, what is reality?In Ancient Greece, the body of a young man turns up in a field and is initially assumed to be the result of a hunting accident. The body was consumed by wolves. However, Diogoros, the youth's tutor at the academy, wants the death investigated. He hires Heracles Pontor who is called &quot;the Decipherer of Enigmas&quot; to look into the matter. Diogoros decides to accompany Herakcles and so we have the investigator and his foil (or Watson). As more bodies start turning up, it soon becomes apparent that there is no question that a murder did occur .At the same time, the translator begins to notice more and more of the text is aimed almost directly at himself and conveys that to the reader by his use of footnotes. This subplot eventually becomes as critical as the actual text of the novel.THE ATHENIAN MURDERS is not simply a murder mystery. It is much deeper than that. It questions our very existence and, as such, becomes almost a philosophical treatise. The presence of Plato lends added weight to the ideas espoused. This unique novel was nominated for two separate dagger awards by the CWA of Great Britain. It was nominated for the Gold Dagger for crime fiction, as well as, the Ellis Peters Award for best historical mystery novel. This should indicate how hard it is to truly categorize. However, one thing in which there is little doubt is that it is a truly superior reading experience albeit somewhat unfocused.

Danny Cray is a part time investigator hired by a wealthy lawyer, Jude Belzer to look into why an Italian billionaire is the target of a smear campaign. Cray, a bit cash starved, jumps at the chance in that he will be very well paid for what appears to be fairly easy work. His investigation takes him to the death of a suspect who commits suicide by entombing himself. He builds a brick wall around himself. The death is highly suspicious. As Cray continues to investigate the case, which takes him all over the world, he begins to strongly suspect that he might be working for the bad guys.John Case delivers a highly entertaining and potent thriller that will never fail to please. The pacing eventually becomes relentless as Cray initially the hunter, becomes the hunted. It is a story of a relatively normal guy getting into something way above himself. Of course, the villain is over the top as is the plot, itself. Yet, given it's primary function to entertain, it succeeds quite easily.

It seems like every year the Edgar committees nominate one book that is so unusual that it stands out amongst the usual fare. Sometimes these books are excellent and would otherwise have remained undiscovered. For example, immediately comes to mind OUTCAST by Jose Latour, which was first published in English by the same publisher as this book. ADIOS MUCHACHOS is a black comedy that also could be considered a noir fiction. Characters are quite wacky and the plot extremely clever.In Havana, Cuba, Alicia literally pedals her wares as a bicycle hooker. However, she isn&#65533;t simply out for money. She views each &#65533;client&#65533; as a prospective ticket out of her poverty-laden life via marriage or a long-term commitment. With the help of her pragmatic mother, Margarita, she seduces her johns with food and drink prior to their sampling of her sexual wares. Into this set up wanders her latest john, Victor King. Victor is involved in hunting for treasures on shipwrecks around the island. The people backing him are extremely wealthy. At first Victor uses Alicia for his own purposes. Later he proposes using her for his plan entailing voyeurism. However, a very unfortunate accident might possibly, with a bit of scheming, leave Alicia and Victor extremely wealthy. The question is, can they pull it off by outwitting the wealthy backers?The rampant descriptions of blatant sex would preclude placing this book among the ranks of the cozies. For those who enjoy hard edged humor, this book will very well fit the bill. The characters, all despicable creations are a pure delight. In spite of their immorality, the reader will find them quite sympathetic. Interest never wanes as the reader roots for Victor and Alicia to succeed in their deception. The book never tries to be a social commentary in that the living conditions in Havana never plays a central role. ADIOS MUCHACHOS is a definite winner and is my pick as the best of the paperback original nominees. However, I really don&#65533;t think it will win in that it is too unconventional.

Ray Atlee is summoned back to his childhood home by his ailing father, Judge Reuban Atlee. Judge Atlee is dying of cancer and, presumably, wants to settle his estate with his sons, Ray and Forrest. However, when Ray arrives at the home, he finds his father already dead. The estate doesn't amount to very much. However, as Ray searches the house on his own, he comes upon a large sum of money not accounted for in the will. The cash totals 3.5 million dollars. After the house is broken into and searched, Ray realizes he is not the only one who knows about the money. As he takes the time to decide how he should handle the situation, he becomes more and more threatened by the shadowy presence of his pursuers.John Grisham, as one of the world's bestselling and best known writers, should set a very high standard for himself. The reason he is so well regarded is much in evidence here. The writing is very strong with a profound sense of place. The characters are well thought out and it is their vivid realism that propels the story along. In a sense, Ray Atlee reminds me of the Dick Francis hero with his strong set of values which must be upheld at any cost. This may be one of John Grisham's best novels in quite some time. However, even at his most mediocre, he is better than the vast majority of writers working today.

Minnesota Detective Sarah Pribek is faced with a very real problem. Her new husband, a fellow officer on his way for training to become an FBI agent, has disappeared. There is simply no logical reason for this that Sarah could imagine. She must, therefore, look into her husband's past to get the answers. At the same time, she is trying to coax a former partner to return to work following the violent death of a daughter while shouldering the feelings of guilt and responsibility for the killer's release on a technicality.Jodi Compton has a definite talent for writing compelling stories and peopling them with above average characterizations. However, there are some definite problems with this debut effort. One could almost see the attempt to pad the plot of the story to book length form. Daily minutiae become important in this endeavor and under the guise of character development. This is one technique I do not appreciate. In actuality, this is a novella sized plot stretched into a 320 page novel. Much has been written about the ending which many have professed as being disappointing. I would concur and add the words unrealistic and manipulative. On the other hand, the book as a whole remains entertaining with a plot compelling enough to keep the pages steadily turning.

Here it is- another semicomic crime filled romp amongst the Florida landscape. Add Claire Matturro to the list of Carl Hiaason, Tim Dorsey, Lawrence Shames etc. After her first novel, she has proven herself a worthy addition.Lilly Rose Cleary is a trial lawyer working in Sarsasota, Florida. She primarily defends doctors from malpractice litigation. She lives alone, is prone to change boyfriends quickly and readily and likes health food. However, her life gets a bit complicated as one client dies of poisoning and her second is shot at while in her car. The question is why? More importantly from her standpoint- is she also a target? She must use her ingenuity to discover the truth.I liked the character of Lily. The fact that I am a Florida physician certainly helps in that regard. However, the author makes both the lawyers and the doctors look ridiculous. Many characters come off as flat. The physicians are silly money grubbing clients but the lawyers are no better and come off as pinheaded weasels. It is this shallow characaturish display of the supporting characters that is the weakness of the book. Its strength comes from the main character, Lily. The plot is overall quite silly but intentionally so and can be somewhat amusing at times. The scene at the end of the villain holding the gun on the heroine while divulging all prior to killing her did not endear this book to me. The length for a first novel is perfect- not too long and not too short- just right.

Ed McBain is a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America. His body of work truly makes him a living legend. Whether writing under the name Ed McBain or his alterego Evan Hunter, his name on a book assures it of a certain style and the highest degree of quality writing. His most famous creation has to be the cops in the 87th precinct. Steve Carella, Cotton Hawes, Meyer Meyer have been with us for over forty five years. They have aged very slowly over the decades. Yet the all the cases remain immediate to this day. As a body of work, the fifty previous books have been a bit uneven. Some were merely good and some are true masterpieces (such as Nocturne). MONEY, MONEY, MONEY represents the fifty first volume of this classic series. It is not the very best one but still is far better than the vast majority of books written last year.Cassandra Jean Ridley, ex- Gulf War pilot, is trying to make a quick buck. She has agreed to fly drugs out of Mexico under radar for a cool quarter of a million dollars. The work, though not without risk, appears quite easy. In fact, life is great until Cass is robbed by a burgler who makes off with two of her fur coats and some cash she was given. This eventually leads to a run in by the burgler with the treasury department questioning whether the cash is counterfeit. All roads lead back to Cass.Carella and Fat Ollie Weeks investigate the death of a woman mauled and eaten by the lions in the local zoo. Her death appears drug related and after finding the body of a bookseller in Diamondback, the "almost exclusively black section of the city" their investigation takes them to the doors of Wadsworth and Dodds , a book publishing company that sells books that nobody wants to read.One of the major strengths of Ed McBain's writing style is his propensity for creating unforgettable characters. He does so through dialogue and descriptions. For example, Steve Carella is always described as having "eyes that slant downward giving him a sort Chinese appearance, though he certainly wasn't Oriental". Meyer is bald and Cotton has a white stripe through his red hair where he suffered a knife injury many years ago. The dialogue is extremely realistic and powerful. The story is quite fast paced which is another McBain trademark vs. the more languid introspective writing of Evan Hunter. In this volume, however, I think McBain may have been attempting to do a bit too much as another plot gets intertwined into the primary investigation. This leads to some improbable coincidences. Nonetheless, nobody writes as good as McBain even when he is not quite at his best.

Jack Taylor was recently thrown out of the Irish Police Force, AKA The Guards. He now functions as a PI when he manages to remain sober. He is asked by a beautiful woman to look into the apparent suicide of the woman's sixteen year old daughter. She feels it is likely to be murder. To find out the answer, Jack must walk the mean streets of Galway.Short, chapters that serve almost as vignettes are the principal form of this impressive work. Dialogue alone makes up quite a bit of the novel. Characters are quite realistic, yet little action occurs. The personal angst the main protagonist undergoes is quite reminiscent of a James Crumbley novel. Crumbley actually provides a testimonial on the back cover. I really don't enjoy the depressing realism of Crumbley and the same holds true for this novel. I fully realize this is a fine, well written work. It just isn't to my personal taste.

In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a wealthy and politically powerful man is found dead in a campsite. He died of a heart attack after a bear attacked his tent. Deputy Sheriff Steve Martinez notices a trail of bacon fat leading to the tent and wonders if this was actually murder. He investigates.The locale of the Upper Peninsula is well portrayed in this well written but routine character driven crime drama. The book is packaged as a Christmas tale and this is really misleading. Parts of the book take place during that time of year but the holiday plays no significant role in the story.

DI Tom Thorne is faced with solving a series of murders. It appears that women are being killed in pairs. Two separate killings are occuring at the same time in and around London. The killers apparently kill in tandem in that the means of death are similar. Thorne must catch them before they kill again. The key is to find out who they are and what drives them to kill.SCAREDY CAT being a pure psychological suspense novel is one of the more disappointing reads of the year. It is packages as a highly suspenseful and fun serial killer novel. However, rather than plot or pacing, the emphasis is on characterization contained in a slow, meandering quite ordinary police procedural. To add to the sense of disappointment, when the true identity of the killer is announced, I scratched my head in bewilderment in that I didn't recall him previously. To his credit, Mark Billingham manages to create full, rich and memorable characters. I just wish they moved a bit quicker.

In a change of pace for Dennis Lehane, his latest novel apparently asks the questions- &quot;What is reality?&quot; and &quot;What is insanity?&quot; After writing a successful series and then hitting it big time with MYSTIC RIVER- an elegiac work that might work as a coming of age novel, as well as, a murder mystery, SHUTTER ISLAND is unlike anything else he has written before. Initially it is a locked room mystery which becomes an island mystery then finally morphs into a suspense thriller with a surprise ending.In the summer of 1954, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are called to a psychiatric facility, Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane located on a rugged New England island by the name of Shutter Island. They are to look into the disappearance of a female patient from a locked cell in the middle of the night. The escape appears impossible. As Teddy and Chuck look into the disappearance, they are given signals that they are themselves in danger. Teddy, however, has another ulterior motive. He wants to find and confront the pyromaniac responsible for his wife's recent death who is purported to be on the island.SHUTTER ISLAND has met with mixed reviews. I wonder what readers would say if the author's name was not Dennis Lehane. Given that it is Dennis who wrote this book, I think the readers who complained simply expected more from him. The story is actually quite clever and is of the length that could be read in one long evening. It appears, with superficial reading, to lack the complexity and depth that one expects from Dennis. However, with more careful reading, that complexity and depth is still there. Once the conclusion is reached, the reader will get a sense of the careful construction that went into this work. The novel is a bit risky for Dennis as he continues to expand his army of core readers. However, he deserves credit for stretching himself into something very different and quite satisfying.

Bonnie Winter cleans up crime scenes. It is her job to use whatever cleaners it takes to remove the blood and gore. In a sense, her own life needs to be cleaned up as well. Her bigoted, lazy husband, so full of complaints, refuses to find work while Bonnie struggles to hold down two jobs. Her son appears to be heading down the same path as his Dad. Meanwhile, her boss at a cosmetics company is enamored with her. There is an underlying hint of evil in that a rare caterpillar is found by Bonnie at several particularly gruesome suicide scenes. Can this be an omen for disaster?TRAUMA is a novella. Yet, it manages to pack more of an emotional whollop than novels three times it's size. By limiting the length of the work, Graham Masterton wastes no time in setting up this dark tale of the unraveling of Bonnie Winter's life. It is actually a character study of a woman in distress-- being boxed in by the world around her. There is a refreshingly stark simplicity in the way the story unfolds. The author is an experienced writer of the horror genre. It would not be incorrect to place this into that category, as well. Truly brilliant.

Phillip Barkley is a Justice Department attorney who is asked to help in an investigation of a Senate aide who has disappeared. The fear is the aide might have been involved in espionage against the United States. Phillip is teamed with an FBI agent, Blair Turner in the investigation. What follows is a very long maddeningly convoluted tale.After an auspicious debut with IN HER DEFENSE, Stephen Horn returns with his second effort . He has created a very complex novel, which actually takes over a hundred pages to hit its stride. However, just as the book becomes truly exciting, the breaks are put on as the reader is subjected to exposition after exposition in an attempt to explain what just happened. In fact, at least half a dozen expositions are necessary to conclude the novel. Included among the expositions is the timeworn and stereotypic scene of the villain holding the hero captive with a gun while divulging all. It just appears to me that if a person is in immediate danger of their life, they will not spend their final moments trying to solve a murder that really should have nothing to do with them. The repeated expositions are indicative of laziness and made the book truly endless.

Judge Calvin Jeffries, an egomaniac with a vindictive nature, is murdered. He is stabbed in the courthouse parking garage. The judge had enough enemies so the suspect list would be voluminous. However, an anonymous phone call alerts the authorities to arrest a homeless man and escaped mental patient who confesses to the crime then commits suicide. It appears to be an open and shut case until two months later when Judge Jeffries' successor is killed in the same location in a similar manner. Joseph Antonelli, defense attorney, agrees to defend the man accused of the crime, another mental patient who was so abused in his past that he is almost unable to communicate. As Joseph looks into the case, he finds that events in his own past plays a pivotal role in the case.There are many legal thrillers published each year. In fact, it is considered a strong dynamic subgenre of the mystery field. I just wonder what made this particular volume stand out in the mind of the Edgar Committee for best novel. THE JUDGEMENT is a competently written, yet overblown work. Characterizations, especially that of the first person narrator, Joseph Antonelli, are skillfully done and is the major strength of the work. The plot, itself, is reasonably compelling yet so very long and, at times, aimless, that reader interest could tend to wane. Courtroom scenes appear realistic, yet, they are a bit too detailed such as the judge's instructions to the jury on courtroom proceedings. The solution, when it comes at last, is ambiguous enough to cause frustration. Perhaps I am being overly critical, however, I think if a book is nominated for the prestigious Edgar Award it should be held to a higher standard. I feel THE JUDGEMENT does not meet that standard. Nonetheless, it is a very entertaining book and a good pick for summer reading.

Dr. Frederick Starks, a New York City psychoanalyst, lives within a highly structured world. He sees his high-class neurotic patients by day and conforms to a rigid lifestyle at night as he tries to forget about his late wife. His sole respite is the annual month long vacation to Cape Cod in the summer. It is on the eve of such an excursion and on his 53rd birthday that he receives a threatening letter. The letter states, "Welcome to the first day of your death...you ruined my life. And now I fully intend to ruin yours." The demand is for Dr. Starks' suicide or an innocent yet distant family member will be killed. The only way for him to "win" this game is to discover who his tormentor is. This, of course totally changes Frederick Starks' life as his comfortable surroundings crumble away. It is a race against time in which someone must die.John Katzenbach is a very versatile writer who seems to be as comfortable writing a drama about a WWII prisoner of war camp as in HART'S WAR as he is writing this thriller on personal redemption and the process an individual would go to redefine themselves. The actual plot is a quite impressive game of cat and mouse with a gradual changing of those roles. Characters are adeptly portrayed. As we progress further into the plight of the main protagonist, the book becomes increasingly difficult to put down. Mr. Katzenbach is a superb entertainer and one whose books deserve the accolades many have already received.

Detective Inspector Orla McLeod is working undercover to infiltrate the drug ring of Tord Svensen. In the process, she suffers much physical and psychological damage including the loss of her partner, Luke Tyler. Orla agrees to take care of nine year old Jamie Buchanan once the assignment is over. Jamie, recently orphaned, is one of the only individuals who has seen Tord Svenson and able to identify him. This knowledge places Jamie in great danger. Orla takes Jamie to her mother's remote cabin where, hopefully, they will be safe. Unfortunately, they soon find out that is not the case.NO GOOD DEED is a very difficult read. The writing is strong and sure. The characterizations skilled and breathe with vivid realism. However, the plot is extremely difficult to follow. The story is quite hard-boiled with some extremely harrowing scenes. However, on reaching the conclusion, I stopped and reflected on the fact that I didn't know what the hell happened. Bottom line: Good writing but hard to read.

Lee, Mal, Ged and Sam are old friends and are all miscreants of one degree or another. They decide to hold up a grocery store. Their plan appears to be relatively solid with the chance of few complications. Little could they have known how many problems would be unleashed upon them. They have women problems, drug dealer problems, fighting among themselves and, of course, the law always one step behind them. As we get to know these hapless anti-heroes, we soon note that they don't appear to be able to anything right. The question is, not only how long can they stay ahead of the law but also how long can they stay alive.Mandasue Heller has written an original and engaging character study with an element of crime. All the characters are unsympathetic figures, yet Ms. Heller imbues them strongly with the breath of life. Their trials and tribulations have a strong sense of immediacy to the reader. The plot, itself, does get a bit bogged down as the various subplots, at first disjointed, begin to come together for the confrontational climax. Nonetheless, the plot remains quite clever. This is a remarkable debut and well worth reading for the character portrayals alone.

In Manchester's Red Light district, a serial killer is preying on prostitutes. They are brutally killed and with each body is left the killer's calling card- a forget me not flower. Within this backdrop lives Pat Noone who has plied her trade on Westy Lane where the dead girls have worked. Pat has a twelve year old daughter, Lisa, who will be taken away from her if she is convicted one more time of prostitution. Pat, however, cannot break out of the life as she insists on drinking herself into oblivion. She chooses to ignore the inherent danger she is in by continuing her work as a prostitute. Lisa, angry about her mother's insistence on not changing, is an angry teenager. She looks for acceptance, approval and understanding from a friend, Benny- a man much older than herself. Samir Rashid is a businessman from India who is stuck in a sexually repressed marriage. He seeks solace in the arms of Pat Noone. On the trail of the killer is Detective Inspector Seddon who feels the pressure to solve the crime before others die. As the story progresses, all these characters come together for the tense and deadly climax.Mandasue Heller proves with her second exceptional novel that she is not a flash in the pan but an unusually gifted writer. The tension in her books arise not only from the compelling plots but the dead on accurate portrayals of the main protagonists. So many books written today fail to incite excitement or tension in the reader by use of these profound characterizations. They fail in either the plot or they get so into the character that plot and pacing is forgotten. Mandasue Heller manages to hold both of those pieces of the book in place I definitely look forward to her next work and if it is as good as the first two I would state emphatically that she belongs among the best of the genre. Move over Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell.

THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is a publishing sensation in the author's native country of Spain. It is now sweeping the world. It is a big book- very long and very detailed. The strength of the work lies in the interpersonal relationships of the characters and the mysterious compelling story that keeps the pages turning.The plot hinges around Daniel, son of a Barcelona bookseller who upon turning ten years old in 1945, is brought by his father to a very large institution called the Cemetary of Forgotten Books. He is instructed to select a book out of the millions of books in the mazelike network of bookshelves and to treasure that book forever. The book he selects is called THE SHADOW OF THE WIND by Julian Carax. Daniel reads the book, loves it and wants to read other books by that author. To his amazement, there are almost no others in the world. It is his seach for the author and his books that leads Daniel onto a path that will forever change his life. It also brings him into direct conflict with a very sadistic police inspector and a mysterious masked man who insists on obtaining every book written by Carax and burning it.In a sense, I am unsure as to what type of book Carlos Ruiz Zafon intended to write. In the beginning, there is a sense of the fantastic in the descriptions of the edifice known as The Cemetary of Forgotten Books. It then evolves into a story of the young Daniel as we watch him grow up and fall in love. Danger lurks in his search for Carax and we begin to see parallels in the lives of the growing young man and the mysterious author. Is it a fantasy? A mystery? A coming of age story? A thriller? The answer is a bit of all of the above. One thing it definitely is is a remarkably adept debut novel- a bit too long- but truly brilliant nonetheless.

Two murders are committed in Central Park, NYC. A psychiatrist is found in his car- an apparent suicide. Also in his car is the dead body of a sparrow with the wings clipped off. The second murder is Charlene Leone, a police officer burned almost beyond recognition. Assigned to the case is NYC detective James Gursen. His partner, Didi Kane is quickly taken off the case when she reveals that she was lovers with Charlene. They must discover whether the two deaths are related and, if so, how.This debut novel is quite problematic. First of all, the author fails to create truly sympathetic characters. She, instead delves deeply into psychology. Rather than characterizing this book as a psychological thriller, it should be called a thriller of psychology. For it is the psychology that is the reason for this book's existence. Long episodes of psychological descriptions and dissertations slow down the pacing and bring a sense of tedium to the story. On the positive side, the author can write with artistic prose. I just doubt her storytelling ability.

Thorn is back and so is Alexandra Rafferty. Fans of James W. Hall's Florida thrillers would recognize those names from previous novels. Thorn is the quintessential Florida hero who prefers to spend his time fishing in the keys. His idyllic life is commonly placed on hold whenever he is subjected to outside evil forces that he must contend with. In this case, he witnesses a jumbo jet crash land in the gulf while he is fishing there. After rescuing as many passengers as he could he notices something not quite right going on. He soon discovers the existence of a device that could shut off electricity at a distance. Hence, the ability to cause massive power failures, not only among aircrafts such as the one Thorn witnessed, but, in whole sections of cities. The device is being sold by the miscreant family called the Braswells. The father, AJ, is obsessed with the capture of a huge marlin responsible for the freak death of his eldest son Andy. Johnny, mentally deficient, is a psychopathic killer and his beautiful sister, Morgan, is evil incarnate. It is this family that Thorn must battle to stop the sale of this potentially devastating weapon. Teaming with Thorn is Alexandra Rafferty, the heroine of BODY LANGUAGE. Alexandra is a Miami PD photographic specialist. Her father, Lawton, suffering from Alzheimer's has stumbled upon the device and is held hostage by the Braswells until it is recovered.The unique aspect of James W. Hall's books is the combination of a superior thriller with truly poetic and lyrical language. He is, not only a superb storyteller, but is a highly talented writer. He bears comparison to James Lee Burke in evoking the Florida landscape. The descriptions of fishing for the marlin is so magnificently described that one can't help thinking of Hemingway's OLD MAN AND THE SEA. The villains are quite similar to those in previous books. The psychopath, Johnny Braswell, bears an uncanny resemblance to Butler Jack, the terrorist of BUZZ CUT. The characters, however, are an overall believable bunch and ones that are quite familiar to fans of Mr. Hall of whom I proudly count myself as one of them. Highly recommended as are all of his books.

So much of today's sports are based on economics. The team that can afford the expensive players can dominate. Hence, in baseball the Yankees with a 130 million dollar salary should and usually do crush a team such as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with their paltry 30 million dollar salary. They really shouldn't even be in the same league. It is actually quite ludicrous. David Ferrell, in his debut novel, SCREWBALL notes how vital dollars and cents are to the business of baseball and reveals just how crazy this has become in this biting satire.The greatest baseball player of all time, Ron Kane, a rookie pitcher who could also field and hit, is acquired by the Boston Red Sox. He is a problem difficult to control causing much heartburn to manager Augie Sharkey. The team is capable of making it to the series but the players must remain under some kind of control. Devisive elements on the team are causing chaos. To top it off, in every city the Red Sox are visiting, men are being killed-- their heads cut off and cuts made in the scalp in an unusual pattern- actually like the seams of a baseball. Is it a fan? Not according to a videotape the owners are sent. It appears to be a player and an important one at that. The owners must pay a ransom to prevent the tape from getting into the hands of the law. The owners placing victory over everything else decide to cover up the tape and the murders. The question is- can they stop the killings?SCREWBALL is a searing indictment of the state of economy driven sports. The story is, at times, over the top. However, it is also very very funny. Characters are in many ways caricatures, yet, they are quite a charming crew. There is little in the way of suspense or surprise except to see whether the Red Sox can break their curse of not winning a World Series. A problem with the book is the inability of the author to keep the plot concise. There is a bit too much rambling and repetition. However, SCREWBALL is a very well done debut and worthy of a reader's attention especially if a fan of baseball.

Whit Mosley is a judge- locally elected with no legal background, as well as, coroner in a small Texas coastal community. Whit's girlfriend, Lucy, is distraught over the deaths of her uncle and his girlfriend. They were murdered and their bodies were found on the uncle's property at Black Jack Point. Buried with the bodies were old bones and rusted hinges dating back almost two hundred years. Whit thinks the murders may have had something to do with the buried treasure of Jean Laffite, the Pirate King.Meanwhile, Claudia Salazar, a police detective, is kidnapped at sea with her boyfriend, Ben. When a ransom is demanded from Ben's brother, the brother refuses to pay and places Claudia directly into harm's way. The question is why? Eventually, Whit and Claudia cross paths as they pursue the same criminals.Jeff Abbott has written five previous well received novels. A problem with this one is the lack of realism in the characters, of which few are likable. For example, the kidnappers of Ben and Claudia discuss their plans directly in front of the victims allowing them to plan their escape. The plot is clunky in that near the conclusion numerous expositions are required and, of course, the overused stock device of the villain holding the hero captive with a gun while divulging all. The plot is too lengthy as interest wanes near the end. A tighter effort in the future may make the next work by the talented Jeff Abbott truly excellent as this one most definitely is not.

In Bologna, Italy, students are being killed by a serial killer- one who assumes the identity of the murdered person. Assigned to the case is Grazia Negro, a detective. Grazia uses a blind man, Simone Martini, who listens to the city on a scanner, to try to apprehend the killer. As usual the crimes become more personal where eventually Grazia, herself, becomes a possible target.ALMOST BLUE is a very well written psychological suspense drama. It is quite unique in its structure. Chapters or actually sections alternate with point of view between the killer's, Simone's and Grazia. The chapters are quite short keeping the pacing rapid throughout. The length of the book is more that of a novella yet works perfectly for the drama portrayed. The end result is a chilling portrayal of the criminal mind.

In Moscow, 1876, a young man walks up to a young woman on a park bench, asks for a kiss and after being rebuffed puts a gun to his head and commits suicide. Why? Detective Erast Fandorin is assigned the case. With Fandorin, the reader travels throughout Europe of that time especially the streets of Moscow in both the highest and the lowest elements of society as a worldwide conspiracy is slowly uncovered that threatens the world.THE WINTER QUEEN gets high marks for originality. Written in the style of a golden age mystery, it actually reads more like a modern day thriller. Given that it is translated from Russian into English, there are some clunky passages and certain episodes that could have been edited. Fandorin's search goes on a bit too long and, at times, borders on tedious. I never got the feeling the characters are well fleshed out. The ending pays homage to a certain James Bond movie but really seems to come out of nowhere. Recommended but with some mild reservations.

I will admit it. I don't particularly like humorous mysteries. I rarely find them funny and always find they lack depth. At best, they are mindless fun. Actually, DATING DEAD MEN is funnier than most and would actually be considered one of the better examples of this type of lighthearted romp through murder, madness and mayhem.Woolie Shelley manages a greeting card shop in California. Her dream is to actually own the shop but to do this she must adhere to Welcome Cards' strict criteria of what makes a great card shop. As the book opens Wollie is being assessed as to how her shop stacks up to their high standards. As she is being reviewed, she receives a terrifying call from her brother in a mental hospital screaming murder. She plans to visit him that night but first must complete another date in her project. She must date forty men in sixty days as paid research for an author writing a book. While visiting her brother, she comes across a dead body on the way to the psychiatric hospital and is 'kidnapped' by a handsome man in a scrub suit. His name is Doc and he owns a ferret. From there things get more and more complicated.I don't often laugh while reading this type of book. I didn't with this one either. However, I did almost smile several times. To be honest, the whole sordid affair is plain stupid. The major strength of this work is not the banal plot or lethargic pacing. It is the wacky characters that we meet along the way to the end of this book that actually reads much longer than it is. However, for the style of writing, the excellent characterizations and the subgenre that it is written (while overlooking my own prejudice) this is a very well written work.

In 1990, Randy Wayne White saw the publication of his first book entitled SANIBEL FLATS. The book introduced marine biologist Doc Ford who resides in a combination houseboat and working marine biology lab in Dinkin's Bay near Sanibel Island. White's character was created at the time the wisecracking PIs flooded the market. Therefore, this biologist with a military background (as befits a thriller hero) was a breath of fresh air. Given the author's familiarity of the Florida west coast as a Sanibel fishing guide, White managed to make Doc Ford somewhat unique albeit with a definite nod to John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. White very much cares about the environment in which he lives. This love and knowledge of his surrounding and their abuse by overzealous developers plays a significant role in the books. As such, many of the books have an inherent agenda built into them. The result is an uneven series of books. Some of his books are excellent and others leave much to be desired. His latest, DARK LIGHT, is one of the better books he has written.A Category 4 hurricane has recently torn through the west coast of Florida very close to Dinkin's Bay, the home port of Doc Ford. His houseboat has sustained significant damage. One of Doc's friends discovers an underwater wreck that has been uncovered as a result of the storm. Artifacts from the wreck appear to be from Nazi Germany. Could this be a W.W.II spy vessel? Challenging Doc and his friend's claim to the salvage of the vessel are some unsavory characters from a local marina whose boat was being piloted by Doc's friend when the discovery was made. Violence could result. To add to the complexity of the plot, a mysterious and alluring elderly woman is also interested in the wreck and agrees to finance the salvage operation as long as she can obtain some of the treasure. Who is she and what is her link to the vessel? The answers, as Doc Ford will soon discover, lies in the past.The strength of any of Randy Wayne White's books are the characters of Doc Ford and his hippie friend, Tomlinson, a fellow resident of Dinkin's Bay. These characters have endeared themselves to his readers and they will always come back for more. White's writing can be a bit more uneven with some brilliantly written passages usually describing the spectacular scenery or some of his worse writing when he is overly preachy concerning the environmental issues. His villains are so stereotypic that they are a forgettable bunch as in this current work. As a Floridian acquainted with the hurricane season, it is easy to be terrified by the repeated threats of the season's storms. This is actually what was most terrifying to this reader in this overlong book. Yet, Randy Wayne White remains one of the strongest of the Florida mystery writers and those unfamiliar with his work would do well to start with either this latest Doc Ford mystery or start at the beginning with SANIBEL FLATS.

The hero of this superb series of political thrillers, CIA agent Mitch Rapp, has two problems to deal with. First of all, an American family is being held hostage by rebels in the Philippines. The Philippine government appears unable or unwilling to help. After a Navy SEALs team is ambushed while attempting the rescue, Rapp decides to attempt the rescue while exacting revenge on those who are responsible for the leak causing the ambush.The second problem concerns a Palestinian assassin attempting to force Israeli concessions for a rapid peace by taking out top Arab leaders while making it look like the Israelis are involved. The question is: who is the assassin and who is he working for? The result of his actions might lead to war.What sets Vince Flynn's thrillers apart from most others is the timeliness of the topics and the realistic and plausible settings. There is little doubt that any of these events could occur in the very near future. Rapp is an ideal thriller super hero, yet, he appears more human than most. As with all of Vince Flynn's thrillers, the pacing is relentless, the action nonstop and the length perfect for entertainment on a long flight or an afternoon at the beach. All his books are highly recommended.

OUT by Natsuo Kirino (Kodosha, 2003)OUT is one of those novels that without the award nomination (the Edgar Award for best novel), would never be brought to the attention of the mystery community in the US. The combination of the small press putting out a very very long translated book is often a formula for disaster. It is a tribute to the Edgar committee that they discovered this gem and gave it the recognition it so deserves.OUT is the story of four women living in the Tokyo suburbs. What they have in common is that they all work the nightshift in a food packaging plant. All have very different but highly troubled lives. Masako Katori, separated from her husband and living with an alienated and troubled son is lonely and bored. Kuniko Jonouchi is in major trouble with loan sharks in that she insists on living well above her means. Yoshie Azuma, a widow stuck into the role of caretaker of an invalid mother-in-law has two troubled daughters and Yayoi Yamamoto living with two small children and saddled with an abusive husband who gambles away what precious little they have. All their lives get overturned when, in a fit of rage, Yayoi strangles her husband and asks Masako to dispose of the body. She agrees and with the help of the others, they must do all they can to avoid suspicion falling on themselves. This proves highly difficult when the loan sharks haunting Kuniko find out the truth.Natsuo Kirino has written one of the most original works of the year. It is character rich with a plot so clever that in spite of the length, the pacing moves relatively rapidly. This is not a perfect work, however. Too much minutiae tends to get in the way of the story progression. Black humor takes over and might remind some readers of the tale of SWEENEY TODD. A major problem with this otherwise carefully written work is the suboptimal conclusion which is the most unrealistic part of the book and proves to be highly unsatisfying.

Several years ago, Robin Burcell debuted with EVERY MOVE SHE MAKES. That was one of my favorite first novels of that year. It was also a favorite of mystery fans all over the country in that it was nominated for an Anthony, as well as, the winner of the Barry Award. At long last, Robin has returned with her second crime novel. She proves, without a doubt, that the accolades given to the first novel was no fluke.Kate Gillespie, a Homicide Inspector of the San Francisco Police Department, receives a frantic phone call from a snitch, Squeaky Kincaid. He wants to meet with her immediately. He feels his life is being threatened by a vast plot. On getting to the meeting place in an alley, Kate witnesses the execution of Squeaky by a fellow police officer. The question is, was she seen and how deep does the bad blood run in the SFPD? Kate fears for her life.At the same time, Kate's aunt wants to find the mother of her nephew, Kevin. He was abandoned by his mother as an infant and his psychologist feels that a reunion would be beneficial. Kate asks her retired ex-partner, Scolari, to look into it.It has been several years since Robin's first book was released. Her books are written in the style of the hard boiled crime fiction. Characters are tough and prove it by walking into danger again and again. Yet, they are very human as evidenced by Kate's persistent struggle with romance and close relationships. Chapters have cliffhanger endings forcing the pages to fly. The plot is quite riveting. A problem with the book, however, are the coincidences that occur again and again. All events are connected. Scenes such as Kate stumbling into an exposition scene in which the villain holds the goodguys hostage just prior to killing them while divulging all, adds to the sense that reality must be suspended. Everything is wrapped up way too neat and pretty at the end. Nonetheless, Robin Burcell has written a highly entertaining novel well worthy of the reader's time.

The time is 1936. Paul Schumann is an American gangster- a hit man who only kills really bad people. He is a killer with a conscience. Paul is captured in a setup and offered a deal instead of prison. He must travel to Nazi Germany with the Olympics team and, while posing as a freelance writer, assassinate Reinhard Ernst, architect of Hitler's rearmament program. However, after an unfortunate killing, Detective Inspector Willi Kohl is hot on Paul's trail. Can Paul complete his assignment and return home safely?As a contrast to THE DAY OF THE JACKEL (which concerned the attempted assassination of Charles DeGaulle), the target, Ernst, is a fictional character so it is plausible that Paul could carry out his assignment as opposed to him killing Hitler in which history would make that impossible. So there is that question that always lingers- will he do it? Interestingly, all of these characters are fascinating creations in their own right. They all have strong beliefs and feel the are on the side of the right. Therefore, there is no true evil figure in this thriller. The supporting cast are also quite interesting. The depiction of the era and the locale makes this book stand out among many other historical thrillers. There is much meticulous attention to detail. However, the plot is often slowed by persistent philosophical discussions adding unnecessary bulk. Well recommended, however.

Thorne, the hero of so many of James W. Hall's thrillers is once again faced with a difficult situation. An insane &quot;pirate&quot;, Vic Joy, wants his land in a prime location on the Florida Keys to build a very large resort. He resorts to kidnapping Thorne's best friend Sugerman's daughter. Thorne tries to use his past relationship with Vic Joy's sister, Anne, to discover where the child is being held. It is a race against time to rescue the child before the insane Joy decides to kill her.James W. Hall never fails to please with his high octane thrillers rich in characterizations and depiction of the South Florida locale. OFF THE CHART is no exception. There is, however, a certain sense of predictability in the plot. A recurring theme in James W. Hall's books is the maladjusted siblings. This has been used in several prior Hall novels. Names of the villains are very original and memorable whether it is the notorious Butler Jack or the current Vic Joy. Technology has finally caught up with the characters in that contact with the kidnapping victim is via satellite internet connection. The plots of the books by James W. Hall are well planned. It is apparent the author knows where he is taking us and both reader and author have fun on the ride. As with all the thrillers by Jim Hall, this one comes highly recommended.

Ben Cooper and Diane Fry are back with their third investigation. In the Peak District, several deaths need looking into. First of all, a young woman, Marie Tennent, is found curled up in the snow. Could she be a suicide or, perhaps, it is something much more sinister. Second, the body of a dead man is uncovered by a snowplow. His identity is unknown. Third, a woman from Canada has come into town to clear the name of her grandfather who piloted a plane into the remote mountainside in World War II. His body has never been found and he is considered to be a deserter. Ben becomes interested and wants to help in spite of his orders to stay away.Stephen Booth's third novel is every bit as good as the previous two. His novels are long, at times, lugubrious, affairs. They are strong on atmosphere, depiction of locale and, most of all, highly realistic depictions of the characters.It is truly remarkable that in so few books, Stephen Booth has soared to the highest ranks of crime writers in Great Britain. I still feel the books are way too long and have always complained about that. However, they are so beautifully written that they can completely absorb the reader into its pages so one forgets the time. This book is as highly recommended as the others.

Seychelle Sullivan is the captain of a salvage boat in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. One morning, she receives a Mayday call from a yacht at sea. The yacht is a vessel Sey is very much familiar with in that her old boyfriend, Neil, is the pilot. The call is made from a desperate sounding woman. Sey locates the boat and discovers the bloody body of a young woman. Neil is nowhere to be found. Things get worse when Sey finds herself the primary suspect of the police. She must discover, on her own, what happened aboard the ship and locate Neil. She soon finds her life in danger.Christine Kling proves in her first outing that she is a writer to be reckoned with. Not only does she have an apparent natural talent at storytelling, but can create memorable, yet, realistic characterizations. SURFACE TENSION is a character driven regional mystery in the same vein as the hard-boiled female protagonists of Marcia Muller, Sue Grafton or Sara Paretsky. It is obvious Ms. Kling knows about boats in that they are major players in this book. The southern Florida locale very much plays a part in this work and is utilized quite effectively. Pacing is brisk and the plot carefully constructed. Florida mystery writers are among the best in the genre. I predict Christine Kling will prove to be no exception to that statement. An impressive debut.

CRIMINAL INTENT by William BernhardtBallantine Books, 2002 $23.95 0-345-44173-7Ben Kincaid, a defense attorney in Tulsa, is asked for help by a friend. A priest, Father Beale, known to Ben since childhood, is accused of murder when two of his parishioners are found dead. One of them was found dead on Father Beale's desk. Ben is now in a position to defend Father Beale against these charges and possibly save his life. However, there is more than meets the eye with the priest and these surprises very much threaten Ben's defense.William Bernhardt is quite adept at writing the courtroom thriller. Most of the action does, in fact, occur in this arena. The trial, itself, propels the book forward as the well sketched characters battle it out. A conclusion that highlights a flaw in the legal system, is a bit unsettling. However, the book is a pleasant enough diversion on a hot summer day.

RETRIBUTION is one of the biggest debuts of the year so far. The reviews have been somewhat negative with a caution to the reader for graphic violence. Personally, it is not the violence that is the problem. It is the predictable plot and conclusion that mars this otherwise auspicious debut.C.J. Townsend is a state prosecutor in Miami. Her latest case is the prosecution of a man accused of being a particularly brutal serial killer. To forego the risk of giving away too much plot, suffice it to say that CJ soon realizes the suspect has a link to her past that she would rather forget.In spite of its flaws, RETRIBUTION is a fun and entertaining read. Characters are really not well rounded and many quite stereotypic. The plot is full of absurd coincidences and requires some suspension of belief by the reader. Violence is excessive. Nonetheless, as with many best selling books, it is good mindless but forgettable fun.

Florida is a unique state. It is the number one tourist destination in the world with more theme parks and pristine beaches than just about anywhere else. However, it also is quickly being overdeveloped and if you believe Carl Hiaasen, it is due to greedy and unscrupulous individuals. However, Hiaasen makes them out to be cruel and ridiculous characters whose greed will lead to their inevitable demise. The fun for the reader is watching them self destruct.The latest Hiaasen antihero is Chaz Perrone who for no explicable reason throws his wife off an upper deck of a cruise ship in a vain attempt to kill her. His wife, Joey, survives and with the help of her rescuer and new friend, former cop and hermit Mick Stranahan, try to come up with answers while exacting their revenge.So many authors try for humor. However, in many instances they try too hard and it becomes quite forced while the plot lags. Hiaasen is the measure of what ingredients go into making the best humorous novels in the mystery genre today. The strength of his work are several. First, the plot is always interesting comically reflecting abnormal behavior in what should be routine situations. In this case taking a cruise vacation. Second, the characters are truly outrageous and unforgettable. The wackiest in this story is Troy, a very large man hired to protect Chaz. He has a bullet stuck in his buttocks which causes him severe pain requiring him to steal pain medicine in the form of adhesive Band-Aids from local nursing homes. Chaz comes in at a close second. He is incredibly self centered worried more about his potency than the well being of his wife or girlfriend. He is a marine biologist who hates marine life as well as biology. Why he does it remains the mystery. Of course it is the act of throwing his wife off the ship that begins his eventual demise. On top of all this is an ecological warning about saving the Everglades and a riveting plot occasionally interrupted by truly hilarious lunacy. Many try but nobody does funny like Carl Hiaasen.

Earl Swagger and his son Bob Lee are the antiheros of this wonderful series of thrillers by bestselling author, Stephen Hunter. Guns play a major part of his work. They are lovingly described and their use is always necessary to gain the desired result. The books are always thick, yet, the pages fly by so quickly that they read like much shorter books. The writing is always strong and sure and this latest is no exception.It is 1951 and Earl Swagger is approached by his good friend, Sam Vincent, ex prosecutor of Polk County, Arkansas. Sam accepts a job from a Chicago attorney to locate a black man living in Thebes State Penal Colony in Thebes, Mississippi. The prison is truly Hell on Earth surrounded by swamps and only accessible by a muddy river. The guards are brutal and gain much perverse pleasure in torturing the inmates. Sam just wants Earl to know where he is headed and to investigate his whereabouts if he doesn't return in a certain time. As expected, Sam is not heard from and Earl must start on his perilous journey to rescue his friend.Stephen Hunter, a film critic for The Washington Post, is an expert on entertainment and uses his expertise when creating his novels. They are among the best thrillers being written today. It is true that the plot can be quite contrived and silly at times, however, they work well. The characters are straight out of the pages of pulp fiction or comic books. The sadistic prison guard, Bigboy, is a pure stereotype. Earl is a superman able to suffer great punishment in just a few minutes than the mere mortal man can endure in a lifetime. Yet, it is fun to root for Earl Swagger to fight and defeat evil wherever he finds it.

Florida state police Bill Tasker is in trouble. He is under suspicion for stealing over one and one-half million dollars. He knows he was framed but the question is by who? The reader, however, is for the most part well aware of who has the money- the greedy lawyer of a false preacher, the corrupt FBI agent, the corrupt cop or even a girlfriend- some still alive but some now dead. The money moves from place to place- hence the title of this overall successful debut.There is a certain wacky sense of reality in this quite noir novel. One is almost reminded of the Elmore Leonard books (who just so happens to give a front cover blurb). The length is somewhat slight yet there is much repetition of the plot that reflects a novice's inability to stay focused on the storyline. The book, therefore, reads longer than it actually is. The characters remain the strength and raise this book among many other firsts this year. Most characters are realistic especially Bill Tasker. Others such as the lawyer Cole Hodges or the corrupt FBI agent, Tom Dooley are characatures but nonetheless remain interesting and viable creations. Overall an auspicious debut effort.

This remarkable book captures the history of the CIA during the cold war from it's early days in post W.W.II Berlin to the downfall of the Gorbachev government. The Yugoslavian revolution, the Kim Philby affair, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, as well as the Iran Contra scandal are also covered in some detail. These separate episodes are kept together by a group of CIA operatives that we get to know quite well. As the time frame of the story is in decades, the characters are multigenerational. As is appropriate, we do not get to know these CIA agents intimately but get to know them more by their deeds and their dialogue. Nonetheless, the characters are suffused with a great deal of humanity. We deal with loss of love, death, honor, as well as, what compels an individual to betray their country.THE COMPANY is one of the longest and biggest books I have ever read. It is also one of the best. If there weren't so many other books to read on my shelves, I am not sure I would have ever wanted it to end. It has been nominated by the CWA for multiple daggers including the Gold Dagger and the Steel Dagger. This bears testimony for the quality of the book in that it is so long, yet the judges were able and willing to get through it. One would be hard pressed to find a better and more all encompassing spy novel than this one.

The late Robert Ludlum was the true master of the international thriller. Upon opening one of his weighty volumes, a reader was assured of being transported all over the world accompanied by one of his idealistic superheroes in the midst of a life and death struggle to save the human race. This posthumous work is no exception and in many ways represents the best of Ludlum.Ben Hartman is on vacation in Zurich, Switzerland. As he leaves his hotel, an old school friend approaches him. Instead of a handshake, his friend pulls out a gun intending to kill him. This highly illogical beginning plunges Ben into a world of intrigue involving his own family's secret history. His search for answers takes him all over Europe and North America as assassins chase him.Parallel to Ben's escapades, Department of Justice field agent, Anna Navarro is given the assignment of looking into the deaths of elderly men all over the world. There appears to be a connection between them through an organization known as Sigma. As the old men continue to die, Anna's investigations take her on a collision course with Ben. They soon realize they have a common foe and join together to attempt to fight this covert organization, which could place the civilized world at stake.Robert Ludlum has done it again. The plot is highly complex yet vastly exciting. All the classic Ludlum elements are here. The world is at risk by an enemy who adequately represents a timely threat reflecting our current events. The hero and heroine are gorgeous globetrotters full of physical stamina and military skills. Much explanation is required to get through the very long plot, which is interspersed with action sequences that justly made Robert Ludlum famous. The solution might be a bit of a stretch, however, Robert Ludlum considered himself primarily an entertainer and with that goal he succeeds again.

On New Year's Day, 1755, Nathaniel Hopson, an apprentice or journeyman to the cabinet maker, Thomas Chippendale, has just completed the finishing touches on the library of Lord Montfort at his country estate. He soon finds himself embroiled in a conflict as Lord Montfort is discovered dead in that same library. It is initially thought to be a suicide due to despondency as a direct result of excessive gambling debts. However, blood on a windowpane and the discovery of a body in a nearby pond tends to indicate a strong possibility of murder. One of the dead men is an old friend of Nathaniel and draws him into the investigation of the deaths. He travels, not only in this country village, but, throughout London to get at the truth.A great deal of research went into this highly atmospheric and exquisitely detailed debut novel. A complaint might be that the author went into a bit too much detail thereby slowing the pacing, at times, to a standstill. However, characters were, overall, very realistically sketched and fit in quite well to the historical setting. It is this innate ability that Ms. Gleeson had to draw the reader into another world that makes this first novel so sterling. The highly compelling plot and clever solution only confirm this as one of the year's best.

Tom Bradby is the author of two previous thrillers in Great Britain. Ironically, his first book published in the US is actually a bold sweeping historical mystery most noted for it's dead on detail of Shanghai in 1926.Richard Field is a young Englishman, recently trained police officer, who is working in Shanghai in the pre-Communist days. Shanghai is a city of contrasts with a French section, an International section and the Chinese section. Each have their own authority in policing their regions. Field works in the International Settlement with his English speaking colleagues. In his first case, he finds himself investigating the brutal stabbing of a Russian prostitute. It seems she was the property of a local crime lord, Lu Huang. Field wants to work the case but he meets resistance along the way. Most would rather not go up against Lu and his umbrella of fear. Field, therefore, faces much difficulty. To complicate matters, he falls in love with another of Lu's Russian women, Natasha Medvedev. This, of course, places him directly into the path of Lu's wrath. Danger abounds as Field tries to solve the crime and very possibly save the woman he loves.Tom Bradby has done copious research in his attempt to bring to life the exotic locale of Shanghai in the year 1926. A detailed map is found in the inside cover of the book thereby setting out the sheer depth that the author will use to tell his story. Characters, both the elegant and the poor are carefully crafted and frequently enter and exit the complex stage as Field goes about his investigation. As is so often the case in these epic detail rich historical novels, pacing suffers as a result. Yet, the exotic locale, the fine writing and the superior characterizations make up for the leisurely pace. THE MASTER OF THE RAIN is well worth the readers full attention.

Christopher Hyde takes us back to Dallas, November, 1963 where a horrible murder occurred. No, not that one-- actually a serial killer is at work. A cut up mutilated body is found in a refrigerator at the local garbage dump. Homicide detective Ray Duval is assigned the case. Duval, diagnosed with congestive heart failure is given a death sentence by his physician. With only a few months to live, Duval diligently tries to solve the case and by doing so save lives. His search reveals the murder is similar to some unsolved crimes 25 years ago. After the assassination of President Kennedy, he is virtually on his own in that the entire resources of the Dallas PD is working on the President's death. The stark contrast of the death of Kennedy to the death of a young black girl is both heartbreaking and illustrative of the times.This is a fine book written and to be appreciated on many levels. It is much more than a typical serial killer novel. It is, in actuality, a searing indictment of the times. Having a penchant for characterizations, Hyde has created a very real detective hero in Ray Duval and that is the major strength of this work by an experienced novelist. Civil unrest, political upheaval and the very essence of life and death are all themes explored in great detail. Problems include a plot that goes on a bit longer than it should, as well as a solution that comes out of left field along with a predictable conclusion. A worthwhile nominee.

Something in her background, however, is not adding up and it appears the judge is lying. As Monk and his partner Lisa Sands look into the matter, their search leads them up to the highest reaches of government and directly into murder.Gene Riehl has written a well paced debut thriller. There is no skimping of characterization as both Monk and Sands are realistic creations. The complex plot has a very well conceived solution and conclusion. However, in the end a bit to complex and a bit too long.

Amy Gutman's impressive first novel, EQUIVOCAL DEATH was a slick polished legal thriller which could have been the start of a series. However, with this second book, it is apparent that she would rather pursue the title of "queen of suspense fiction". THE ANNIVERSARY actually is a strong bid for the title.Three women are haunted by their past relationship with an executed serial killer, Steven Gage. Gage is reported to have murdered over one hundred women so his trial and subsequent execution made worldwide news. Now, on the fifth anniversary of Gage's execution, the three women receive a note saying "Happy anniversary, I haven't forgotten you." Who is sending the note and what does it mean? Callie Thayer, one of the women, fears the possible danger the note represents, not only to her but to her eleven year old daughter. Her fears prove correct as her life is in imminent danger.In the years since her first novel, Amy Gutman has polished her writing style impressively. She hits this novel with all cylinders running. The plot is compelling, well paced and has plenty of twists, turns and red herrings to keep any reader at the edge of their seat. Characters are so strongly portrayed that it is remarkable this is only her second opus. Length is a bit excessive but the book has so many positive traits that this can be overlooked. A strong recommendation.

Sue Trinder is a seventeen year old girl who lives among theives in London of the mid-1800s. She is the daughter of a murderess who was hanged a short distance from her flat. Sue lives with Mrs. Sucksby, a foster mother who raised Sue from an infant. She also lives with some petty theives called fingersmiths or pickpockets. Into this mix wanders Gentleman, another criminal who is currently employed by an eccentric book collector in the countryside to help catalogue the works. This book collector's niece, Maud Lilly, is a naive young girl who will fall into a fortune after she gets married. Gentleman wants to seduce her and marry her. He comes to elicit the aide of Sue who he wants to become the personal maid of Maud to convince her that marriage to gentleman would be in her best interest. However, many surprises are about to befall both Sue and Maud as they get much, much more than they bargained for.Sarah Waters has written one of the most compelling mysteries I have read in years. It is epic in length, yet, the story is quite simple, always suspenseful, and, hence reads like a much shorter work. The leisurely pacing facilitating the use of strong realistic characterizations, as well as, the year the story takes place will conjure up the inevitable comparisons to Dickens. However, this is probably not fair. Few writers have ever been able to create so many well known and beloved characters as Dickens. Ms. Waters concentrates her efforts on the plot with serviceable characters. She writes from a time almost one hundred and fifty years after the time her story takes place and what is remarkable is the fact that she has the ability to completely immerse the reader into that time period. With the extreme length, however, the story does lose its focus intermittently. However, overall, this is an excellent work and a worthy winner of the Ellis Peters Award for historical mysteries of the CWA.

O'Connor is a journalist who has written exposes on Hollywood stars. Her current assignment is to work on a book about a famous comedy team duo the handsome singer Vince Collins and the comedian Lanny Morris. (Think Martin and Lewis) There are secrets in their past that O'Connor must uncover including a murder. The way to the truth lies in her multiple series of interviews she will have with Vince Collins who for one million dollars will tell all. A problem develops, however, when she meets Lanny strictly by coincidence on a trip to New York. He is writing his own autobiography so he is not interested in O'Connor's project. Under an assumed name she develops a relationship with him but is always under the threat that either Vince or Lanny is a murderer. The question is who?Rupert Holmes has written a delightful first novel. One cannot help but think of Martin and Lewis when reading about this comedy team that broke up many years ago. Richly detailed characterizations and settings make this novel stand out. This is, however, a problem with the book in that details can be so painstakingly described (such as a trip to Disneyland by Vince and O' Connor), that pacing and plot progression suffer as the pages add up. The book, however, is quite compelling and the mystery puzzling enough to keep the pages turning. Highly recommended.

Superlatives such as "adrenaline-pumping, heart pounding thrill ride" or "high octane adrenaline-powered" are some of the descriptions of this book on the cover testimonials of this debut by author, Clinton McKinzie, a mountain climbing ex- Deputy DA. His story is about a mountain climbing (no surprise) Special Agent Antonio Burns.In the mountains of Laramie, Wyoming, a young woman is found at the base of a mountain presumably the result of a climbing accident. However, Antonio Burns, in his investigation, finds a bottle on a high cliff with her blood and hair on it. The possibility of murder must be entertained. Suspects include a local hooligan who is a climbing enthusiast, as well as, the son of the DA, Nathan Karge, who is running for Governor. It is a case Burns must tread very carefully on. At the same time, Karge is trying a case concerning the murder of another young woman-perhaps racially motivated. On trial for their lives are two brothers whose only crime may be their racist views. Again, with Karge in control, there may be more than meets the eye.Clinton McKinzie can write. Of that there is no doubt. However, I would tend to disagree with the above superlatives. There is no "heart pounding" action. In fact, this is a character driven regional mystery with the unique aspect being the passages describing rock climbing. It is a well-written formulaic novel that, in my mind, never really develops a steady pace. The pedestrian plot moves leisurely through the book until the obligatory final confrontation, which holds little surprise. A warning to cozy lovers-a dog gets hurt.

Dr. A. Roman Michaels is a prominent plastic surgeon in St. Paul, Minnesota. He is also a serial killer of prostitutes. He gets a sexual thrill out of their deaths. On his trail is Detective Paris Murphy who identifies the right suspect early on and is not above using herself as a decoy to implicate Michaels. The police are frustrated by the fact that they feel they have identified their man, yet they cannot act due to the political connections Michaels has. It soon becomes a game of cat and mouse- however, who is the cat and who is the mouse?Theresa Monsour's debut novel is notable for the early identification of the killer by the police with their frustrating inability to act. The story, though unoriginal, is entertaining and moves along at a reasonable rate. There are several moments when it seems the book is padded and I question the need for the excessive length. Nonetheless, it is a fairly good first novel.

Historical personages Dr. Oliver Wendall Holmes, James Russell Lowell, publisher J. T. Fields and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow are members of the Dante Club--an intellectual endeavor to provide the first translation of Dante's THE DIVINE COMEDY. However, people are dying in 1865 Boston. They are murdered in the most gruesome fashion. Only the members of the Dante Club realize the murders are fashioned after Hell's punishments in Dante's work. With the future of their work in danger, they must solve these brutal crimes.THE DANTE CLUB is one of the most pretentious works put out as mainstream thriller fiction in quite some time. Matthew Pearl is a Dante scholar and he wastes not a sentence in making sure the reader is aware of that fact at the expense of plot progression. Characterization is extremely spotty and no character is truly sympathetic. This is actually a somewhat difficult book to read in that it is so poorly constructed and many times the story is difficult to follow. On the positive side, Mr. Pearl manages to portray Boston of 1865 convincingly and the premise of the book is quite original. The packaging (ie. The bookjacket) is also quite attractive.

LABYRINTH by Kate Mosse (Orion, 9.99) Rating: B-This huge complex historical novel concerns two women. The first is named Alais who lives in medieval France around 1208. There is a problem in this southwestern part of the country. The Inquisition is beginning and the Crusaders and French Army under Papal orders are invading the towns looking for heretics to kill. Alais' people are resistant because they live among the individuals known as heretics and will defend them. There is also a matter of a certain book that Alais is given that is supposed to contain the secrets of the Holy Grail. She must keep it safe at all costs.The second woman is named Alice and lives in the present time. Alice stumbles upon a tomb on a dig outside of Carcassone that contains two skeletons. Who are they? She quickly gets embroiled in a struggle to acquire the three books that contain the secrets of the Holy Grail.LABYRINTH is a major bestseller in England. In fact, I was told it supplanted the JK Rowling book at the top of the bestseller list. There is much comparison between this book and THE DAVINCI CODE in the book jacket testimonials. Let me make this perfectly clear- this is no DAVINCI CODE. DAVINCI is a fast paced read that has taken the world by storm. LABYRINTH is a painfully long book that juxtaposes the past with the present. There is a bit of the occult in that Alice dreams of Alais as if she were reincarnated. The story is convoluted and moves quite often at a snails pace. I reached the ending almost in relief. The movement between time is cleverly done with the plot of Alais segueing into Alice almost effortlessly. The bottom line: Interesting but endless. A very mild recommendation.

This book was recommended by a noted mystery book store. It was said, by them, that it will be short listed for all the major awards. That may well be, but, certainly not any of the mystery awards. It is not a mystery- a well written novel but definitely not a mystery.Three apparently unrelated plots are described simultaneously via alternating chapters. The first concerns a professor taking his young wife and her mentally retarded sister on a scientific expedition to Easter Island from their home in England in 1913. The second concerns the ill fated voyage of Admiral Spee, a German commander whose fleet was destroyed during W.W.I off the Falkland Islands. The third occurs in 1973 when Greer Farraday travels to Easter Island to study pollen there. The plots converge in a unique and clever way near the end of the book.Slow, meandering and somewhat dull are useful adjectives when describing this overwrought and overdone mainstream novel. Characters are extremely well sketched as would be expected in this pure character driven novel. The characters, as well as the carefully constricted setting, are the strengths of this otherwise forgettable novel.

Jack Solomon works for an aid organization in Sarajevo. His job is to identify the remains of the many dead bodies- the casualties of the war. The work is quite grisly, yet, with the use of DNA, the work gets done. One day Jack is asked to look into the remains of twenty six bodies found in a truck at the bottom of a lake. The bodies have been in place for years, yet, the frigid waters have preserved them remarkably well. A young child clutching a teddy bear is among the victims. The horrific nature of the crimes gets to Jack above all others. He insists on trying to solve the crime and does so by searching for the one surviving relative. His search takes him to the criminal underworld of Sarajevo, as well as, the red light district of London and encounters with the Russian Mafia.For a thriller, Stephen Leather's books have a languid pacing. They are character rich works that delve into whatever locale they are set. There is much local color interjected in the work. Once the topic is discussed and the plot is truly underway, the pacing begins to pick up quite rapidly. The climactic scene is literally quite explosive. The red herring at the end of the book is a bit farfetched and the conclusion a bit less than satisfying. Consider Stephen Leather's books to be thinking man's thriller more along the lines of LeCarre than Ludlum or Higgins.

Susannah and her twin sister Marina grew up in rural Georgia. Their silent communication to each other they called &quot;nightspinning&quot;. As they grew older, Susannah, to establish her independence cut all ties to her sister. However, Marina is violently killed one night. She apparently was stalked and now through various signs, it appears the same stalker is after Susannah. The police appear impotent to stop the stalker and Susannah must try to discover who the murderer is to not only solve her sister's death but to prevent her own.THE NIGHTSPINNERS is a good solid suspense novel. Well paced and scary enough to keep the pages flying. However, if a reader is well read in this genre, there is a strong sense of deja vu in that the plot seems to lack originality. It is an entertaining but highly forgettable novel that really should not be on any short list for a major award.

One of my favorite series features Repairmen Jack. He "fixes" things and frequently those things concern insidious evil that can cost many innocent victims their life. In this, the fifth episode, Jack must deal with several threats. First of all Jack must protect his identity when he saves a subway carload of passengers from a crazed killer. Second, he must battle a virus, which threatens to take over the personality of the victims and potentially infect the whole human race robbing them of individuality. This would change mankind as we know it. Third, he must reestablish ties with an estranged sister who is under immediate threat from the virus.F. Paul Wilson writes a highly effective thriller, which is quite typical of this series. They have in common a scientific horror, which can include monsters or deviant drugs with many lives at stake. Characters are very effective, yet, some are more reminiscent of those found in comic books. The pacing never wanes right up to the usual explosive and fiery conclusion. This is no masterpiece but it is pure entertainment and that alone is no small feat.

Baltimore PI, Tess Monaghan, is hired by Mark Rubin to find his family. Mark, a furrier, is a ruthless businessman, controlling husband, but, loving father. He remains true to his orthodox Jewish roots. He comes home one day to dicover that his wife and three children have disappeared. He wants them back and hires Tess to find them. Unbeknownst to him, Natalie, his wife, has run off with Zeke, an ex-con infatuated with her Hollywood looks. He was not counting on her bringing along her three kids. Now they must run away robbing banks to keep on living and moving. Tess taps into an internet resource called Snoop Sisters, a group of female PIs, to track them down. Things are never easy and for Zeke to be truly free, murder may be necessary.In my view, Laura Lippman is a much better writer today than when she was writing the early Tess paperbacks. Her writing is much more focused on plot progression with really no effect on superb characterizations. For example, there is no party scene where we get to meet a dozen new characters at once. There are a couple of irksome dining scenes but they are few and far between all with a purpose of plot progression-- an aunt's wedding not withstanding. Written in alternate point of view chapters between Tess's investigation and Natalie's story serves to keep the plot moving along at a remarkably rapid pace. In fact, this is not just a PI novel but can also be considered a thriller. I will admit that after this book I like Tess. She is both clever and feisty. This is easily the best Tess book written and one of the best series books I have read in years. It is well balanced and as such the voice of Tess comes through loud and clear. To me, the most eagerly anticipated book of 2005 is the next stand alone by Laura Lippman. If it is as good as the last two I would strongly agree with those that consider Laura Lippman's books as the best that crime fiction has to offer. This is my pick for the Edgar award as Best Novel.

In probably her best work since the modern classic, A PLACE OF EXECUTION, Val McDermid has written a mutifaceted tale that spans decades in terrifying bookends related to a single murder.Four best friends come across the dead body of a local barmaid and their lives would never be the same. In 1978, Alex Gilbey and three of his friends are crossing a park at night while staggering home after a local party when they discover the body of a young woman. They report the discovery to the local police and are immediately considered suspects due to their reckless youth. The dead girl, Rosie Duff, was found raped and stabbed multiple times. Rosie's two brothers, enraged by the senseless death begin taking out their anger on the four youths. Another death results just prior to the time change to the present where the youths, now grown find themselves at the hands of a possible serial killer.The senseless murder forms the hub around which the spokes of the story, complex relationships and interactions of the multiple characters revolve. The reader is kept in suspense and is truly never given the solution until the very end. The depth and richness of the characters, quite remniscent of Val Mcdermid's best work, give the book its incredible strength and potent emotional impact. The juxtiposition of time halfway through the story adds a layer of depth and, in essence, begins a completely new story. A brilliant work.

Kate Byrne is an elementary school teacher in the midst of having an affair with the father of one of her students, Lucien. The child's mother has just completed a true crime book concerning a local murder-- the death of a man's mistress presumably by the jealous wife and the wife's subsequent disappearance. Of course, Kate becomes increasingly unnerved by the mother's obsession with the murder and worries about the possible danger to herself. It quickly begins to prove her undoing. Meanwhile, Lucien appears to be suffering the effects of his mother's work as evidenced by the highly violent pictures he draws.The book is a treatise on the unraveling of a dysfunctional young woman unable to fully participate in the adult world. In spite of it's brief length, this is a very dense book which can prove to be highly confusing to the casual reader. A fable of animals is interspersed in the tale, which adds to the confusion. Great books are worth taking the time to slowly read and figure out what the author was saying. This book is definitely not great and therefore, in the end, proves to be way more confusing than it needed to be.

Sometimes I am amazed by the sheer volume of books the Edgar committees must consider. Surely they must feel even more overwhelmed when they are faced with the daunting task of having to consider a very long book written in a leisurely manner and difficult to get into. Forget about why they would consider SOUTHLAND. How the heck did they ever have the time, energy or motivation to read this?Jackie Ishida who is Japanese American, is faced with the death of her grandfather, Frank Sakai. As she sorts through his will with her aunt, they note the will contains a name they never heard. As Jackie investigates who this person is, she comes upon a story of three young Japanese men being trapped in the freezer located in the shop of her grandfather. The deaths occurred during the Watts Riots in 1965. Who were they and why were they never mentioned before?There is a problem with this book. It is well written with some truly beautifully conceived vignettes each revealing that the book is carefully constructed with much thought. However, there is a supreme lack of inertia that not only threatens but finally manages to overwhelm the complex plot with pacing being the ultimate casualty. The story just goes nowhere for what seems like forever. However, just when the frustration level reaches it's peak, the story begins to coalesce. The separate characters begin to merge through both time and space toward the common goal of getting at the truth. This is a heartbreaking tale told with great compassion. It is a book meant to be read leisurely and thoughtfully. In this hectic world in which we live, many readers might find it hard to give this book the careful reading it so very much deserves. Kudos to the Edgar Committee for taking the time and effort to read this one. Akashic Books also deserves our gratitude for taking the chance.

The psychological thriller deserves its own designation as a mystery subgenre. It certainly is becoming more popular. The Brits seem to have perfected it with the work of Ruth Rendall, Minette Walters, Andrew Taylor and the remarkable Mandesue Heller among many many others. These books have in common very strong characterizations with the underlying sense of foreboding. Either a crime has taken place and the characters must deal with that or there is the chilling possibility of a crime that might occur at any moment. These books slowly and inexorably bind the reader up with a whole host of tensions. The characters might be likable or odious. The one thing they all have in common is the ability to make a reader read compulsively to discover the ultimate conclusion and may take its time getting there.Laura Lippman, so well known from her Tess Monaghan series, wrote her first stand alone which was published two years ago entitled EVERY SECRET THING. This marked a remarkable change in her writing while revealing her ability to fully flesh out human suffering. It is a chilling novel that many considered the very best of the year. Now she returns with another psychological thriller even richer and more fully detailed than the last work.Three friends are found in a school bathroom. All are shot. Kat Hartigan, the popular one who everybody loves, is dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. Josie Patel, the athletic one, has been shot in the foot and the brooding actress Perri Kahn, said to be the cause of it all, is critically wounded with an apparently self inflicted bullet through her face. The question that must be answered is- what actually happened and why? We then travel back in time to that day, many years ago when the three seemingly inseparable friends first met and proceed to travel ever so slowly down this inevitable road to destruction where all answers eventually lie.Laura Lippman in her second standalone again displays her mastery of the psychological thriller. She writes with a true depth of understanding the human character which gives her novels their profound realism. This is by no means a fast quick read but will certainly reward the patient reader. It is a superb work by one of the finest writers of crime fiction in this country. Laura Lippman is at the height of her writing powers. Easily one of the best of the year.

One of today's finest writers of crime fiction is George Pelecanos. He has previously written the &quot;Washington quartet&quot;-- a group of books, actually historical mysteries, that took place over a number of years and shared characters. His latest series concerns PIs Derek Strange and Terry Quinn. Strange started Strange Investigations and hired Quinn, a retired police officer. I considered the first book in the series, RIGHT AS RAIN, to be one of the best books of last year.Several separate plots are occurring simultaneously. Strange and Quinn are hired to recover a fourteen year old girl working as a prostitute for Worldwide Wilson, a hardened operative. One of the problems is that the girl does not want to go home. Another plot concerns three homicidal young men who want to knock off a man who owes them money. The man is an uncle to one of the boys playing on Strange's youth football team that he coaches. When the boy becomes involved, Strange and Quinn want vengeance.HELL TO PAY is another sterling example of what makes George Pelecanos one of the best. He is a master of characters and dialogue. They reflect the highly realistic milieu of the nation's capital where this series takes place. He successfully balances these superb characterizations with a truly riveting plot. The book is also just the right size. Other practitioners of the crime fiction art would do very well to read and learn from this very, very fine writer. One of the best of the year.

In Eastern Europe, 1948, twenty two year old detective Emil Brod is given his first murder case for the People's Militia. A famous patriotic songwriter is killed in his home. As Emil investigates the murder he realizes there may have been a political reason for the killing. While questioning the upper hierarchy of the party, he is suddenly suspected of being a spy. With death being the penalty for a convicted spy, Brod now finds his own life in danger. He can expect no help from his colleagues in the People's Militia. Emil, with so much at stake, cannot abandon his search for the truth.THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS is a period piece historical novel with a major strength being the descriptions of the locale- the exact location of which is unknown. Characters almost play a supporting role to their surroundings. The author keeps things in proper perspective, however, as the plot moves quickly to its clever ending. With the strong reliance on the almost unbearable oppression of the people, one immediately recalls the historical dramas of J. Robert Janes and LIE IN THE DARK by Dan Fesperman. Very well done.

Adam Chapel is a CIA agent who is actually a forensic accountant. He follows trails of money. There is an apparent plot for another terrorist attack in the US. To determine the source of the plot and to stop it, the CIA uses Adam Chapel to follow a trail of money which presumably would lead to the terrorists. Teaming with Chapel is British agent Sarah Churchill. They must race with time to prevent another disaster of at least equal proportion to 9/11.A forensic accountant! Good G-d what will they think of next? Riech, a former banker, has written several previous novels concerning international high finance. All of them are considerably more successful thrillers than this one. There are many moments in this very long book that it reads about as exciting as an accountant's spreadsheet. The plot is highly predictable and the characters are, like this book, quite forgettable.

Cozy mysteries are usually not to my taste. So it was with some trepidation that I approached the third mystery by Roberta Isleib featuring Cassandra Burdette, professional golfer and amateur detective. I had problems with Roberta's first mystery, SIX STROKES UNDER. Specifically, I did not care for the character of Cassie and found it highly improbable that she would mentally be ready to attempt qualifying for the LPGA after being involved in the death of a fellow contestant. Pacing was also a bit of a problem. All of these issues have been successfully resolved as Roberta Isleib has written a very entertaining and clever mystery.Cassie Burdette is hired as a touring pro at a country club in Connecticut, after floundering on her initial attempt to meet with success on the LPGA tour. One of her first duties requires her to stand on the tee of a par three hole challenging the foursomes passing through to hit the ball closer to the hole than herself. While waiting, she discovers a dead body in a patch of high grass. The police are called and it is soon afterwards that Cassie is told that one of her golf clubs were found near the body with blood on it. Cassie is therefore a suspect and now feels she must clear her name thereby giving her the excuse to try to figure out the cause of the death. After another dead body turns up, Cassie feels some real pressure especially when an attempt is made on her life.My only real problem with this book is the need for a character list. It is difficult to keep track of who exactly is who. However, with some effort, the character identification falls into place and the pacing of the story picks up quite nicely. I appreciate the need for Cassie to investigate the murders with her own reputation at stake. The character of Cassie is much more fully realized and much more sympathetic and likable to this reader. Suspects come and go and when the true killer is revealed, the solution is both clever and unexpected. The bottom line- a very good job by Roberta Isleib and a strong contender for best PBO at the Agathas next year.

Dennis Lenahan is a professional show diver. He travels the US looking for the opportunity to showcase his talents. It is in Tunica, Mississippi that he lands a job doing a diving show at the Tishomingo Lodge and Casino. While there he befriends many of the eccentric characters including many women and a black gangster from Detroit named Robert Taylor. After inadvertently witnessing the execution of his helper by the local mob, Dennis feels his own life is in danger and accepts the friendship of Robert Taylor who soon pulls him into his scheme to take over the drug trade of Tunica from the local boys. The showdown will occur at a Civil war reenactment.The art of characterization is what Elmore Leonard does best. In fact, he may very well do it better than anyone else. This latest book is no exception to that. The plot can be a bit flimsy but it is the characters that bring it to life. Humor is also interspersed with the relatively casual and emotion free murders. The use of a Civil War reenactment provides a clever yet lighthearted approach to the ludicrous behavior of the bad guys and the really bad guys.

Two teenage girls have disappeared off the streets of Duluth, Minnesota. Lieutenant Jonathan Stride is assigned to solve the case. As with any crime, the first people he must look at are the victim's family. There is something not quite right with the family of Rachel Deese, the last girl to disappear. Her relationship with her mother was extremely strained and her relationship with her stepfather extremely suspicious. Could it be foul play? The road Stride must travel to get at the truth is fraught with many deep potholes and as many surprise twists and turns as the most dangerous mountain pass.St. Martin's has high hopes for this author. Their hopes are well founded. Brian Freeman, a marketing executive for a law firm, has hit a grand slam his first time at bat. It is easily the most entertaining debut novel of the year. He never tries to be too pretentious. Instead of concentrating on poetic and lyrical language, he goes straight for the reader's jugular and never lets up. The characters are well fleshed and the major ones full of great depth. The story, itself, is easily the strongest part of the novel. It simply never lets up. Even when the plot appears to be winding down, there are more sudden twists ahead. In fact, it is not until the very last pages that everything falls into place. IMMORAL is one of my favorite reads of the year so far. I predict great things from Brian Freeman.

Joe R. Lonsdale won the Edgar Award for best novel several years ago for his historical drama, THE BOTTOMS. He returns now with another literary historical crime drama, SUNSET AND SAWDUST. There are few writers of the genre that can so successfully evoke a time and place as Mr. Lonsdale. In his hands, East Texas comes as alive as the Louisiana Bayous of James Lee Burke, the Los Angeles of Michael Connelly or the gripping narratives of Thomas H. Cook. Landscape is as important as character and plot progression.In depression era East Texas, Sunset Jones kills her husband as a tornado destroys her house. Sunset fearing for her life as her husband was about to rape her, pulls the trigger. Through a quirk of fate, she takes over the job of constable of Camp Rapture, a small sawmill town. Her deputies include Hillbilly, a violent drifter who Sunset is attracted to (as is her teenage daughter), and Clyde, a local resident who in wanting to start over decides to burn his house down. The dead body of a baby as well as a woman who Sunset's husband was seeing prior to his death turns up on a local farmer's land. As Sunset investigates, she uncovers a plot to steal oil saturated land. Death, of course ensues. The question arises, can Sunset get out of this alive?The vividly portrayed and carefully constructed characters set this story above the ordinary. Mr. Lonsdale is a fine writer capable of flinging similes and metaphors as well as the best literary writers working today. After reading this well paced and clever story, the reader will feel their time was well spent.

Gabriel Allon is an art restorer living in England. He is also a highly trained Israeli agent used by the Foreign Ministry headed by his boss Ariel Shamron. Allon is asked to restore a painting in the home of a prominent Swiss resident in Zurich. Unfortunately, upon arrival, Allon finds his host dead on the floor. As Allon looks into the death, he eventually begins to uncover a sinister plot involving prominent Swiss businessmen throughout the country. In an effort to discover the cause of her father's death, Allon is accompanied by Anna Rolphe, the victim's daughter and a world-class concert violinist. Always behind them is the English assassin who eventually sets his sites on Anna.I have often said that Daniel Silva is one of the best thriller writers currently working. After having discovered his books several years ago, I have eagerly awaited each one as they are released in the spring. Silva has a prodigious way of drawing the reader immediately into the story by use of vivid characterizations, dangerous situations, and exotic locations. Some time is, of course, required to fill in details of the plot which can admittedly be a bit complex, however, never as complex as so many of Robert Ludlum's books. They are easy to grasp which is important considering these books are not meant to require a great deal of brain cells while being read. The story flows smoothly and the suspense never lets up. Again, I strongly urge the reader to check out the work of this new master of the international thriller sub genre.

Jane Hudson teaches Latin at Heart Lake School for Girls, a private school in the Adirondacks. She also attended school there as a student and was an intricate part of it's dark history. Three of Jane's friends died there while she was a student, by accident or suicide. In an effort to come to terms with her past, Jane returns with her young daughter after a failed marriage. The past soon appears to be repeating itself when a student, once again, attempts suicide. A journal is missing from Jane's student days and it is this that may hold the key.Carol Goodman has written a richly atmostspheric debut novel. The frigid winter on the lake is skillfully rendered in a way rare for a first time novelist evoking an uncommon maturity in writing style. Characters are meticulously created to lend an air of authenticity to their actions. The plot is slowly unraveled which well compliments the languid pacing. Yet with the level of suspense and and the realism of the characters, the pages fly by.

This debut novel was displayed in the front of both Borders, as well as, Barnes and Noble, with both stores pushing it as a superior and fun summer read. It should be a swashbuckling adventure novel but it has to rank as one of the most poorly constructed books I have read in quite some time.Alex Hawke witnesses the death of his parents aboard their yacht by pirates when he was a child. He has since grown to adulthood and works for both the CIA and British secret service. He is assigned to look into the disappearance of a Soviet sub that could launch strikes against the US mainland. Of course, his assignment eventually takes him into the direct path of his parent's killers.Don't waste your time on this downright idiotic almost unreadable work.

THE EYRE AFFAIR is one of the most starkly original books I have read in years. Not knowing what to fully expect, I never made it past the first fifty pages upon my initial reading of it last year in spite of the universal acclaim that accompanied it. I, therefore, decided to give it another chance and am quite glad I did.Thursday Next is our heroine. She is what is characterized as a literary detective. She pursues our villain, Acheron Hades, an old professor of hers who now kidnaps characters from original manuscripts and holds them for ransom. Thursday, in her quest to thwart the plans of Acheron, must enter into the stories themselves to save the characters. One of Acheron's most vile threats is to remove all traces of Jane Eyre in the novel bearing her name.Is this novel a mystery? Probably not. I would characterize this work as a science fiction/ fantasy thriller. The plot of a mad villain wreaking havoc on the free world who can only be stopped by the hero probably is the reason for its enthusiastic inclusion in the mystery genre. I place a premium on originality and this book definitely is just that. There is much that the reader must understand and accept before they can get truly swept up in the exciting narrative. Among them is the ability to enter into books through a special portal. Time can be traveled both backwards and forwards and can actually stop as evidenced by the infrequent visits of Thursday's time hopping father. Names are truly wonderful. Unforgettable examples include (besides Thursday Next) Braxton Hicks and Jack Schitt. The book is full of playful references to words and literature and never takes itself truly seriously. THE EYRE AFFAIR is unique, exciting and one of the best debuts of the year.

I usually don't read nonfiction books. However, World's fairs have always fascinated me. This book is not only about the construction of the 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago but about a serial killer who prowled the grounds at that time.The world was recently enthralled by the world's fair in Paris. The United States was to host the event in 1893. They wanted to at least equal if not surpass the efforts of the Parisians. David Hudson Burnham, famous architect of the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington D.C., wanted to bring the fair to the city of Chicago. After winning the bid from such competition as New York and Washington, he then needed architects to participate in planning the fair. He enlisted some of the best in the country after much arm twisting. We then witness the rise of the fair. We also take a virtual trip through the grounds once constructed. It was the fair that introduced Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum, Cracker Jacks, Aunt Jamima's pancake mix and Shredded Wheat. The attempt to build something better than the Eiffel Tower saw the construction of the first Ferris Wheel.At the same time, a physician, AH Holmes, built a hotel complete with a basement torture chamber. He managed to kill many women- the total number might range from a dozen to a couple hundred. He was a killing machine. The book covers his rise and fall in great detail.Remniscent of THE ALIENIST, THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY transposes the reader back to a time and place considered simpler in this day and age. However, it proves to be anything but that. It a fascinating look at what made the fair great but well documenting its darkness.

In the backwoods of West Virginia lies the heart of a kiddie porn operation. Into the lazy town of Shawnee drifts fourteen year old Molly Small, a prostitute- spunky, brash and old way beyond her years. She is looking for Turk, the man she wants to live with the rest of her life. She finds instead Stupe, a mentally impaired young man with strong religious convictions at odds with his belief to honor his mother and father. He learns that his father, Shug, runs a kiddie porn network that has harmed and occasionally killed young children. Stupe knows he must eventually stop his father- the question is how to do it and still remain true not only to the Ten Commandments but his new friend Molly. The result leads to an explosive confrontation that rings both tragic and true.Very very impressive characterizations make this debut effort stand out. No less impressive is the great sense of locale. The remote Appalachian backwoods literally comes alive. There are slight problems with the flow and pacing of the story which appears to run out of steam about thirty pages too early. However, this is a remarkable achievement and well worth the reader's time.

Some books can take their time to hit their stride. They start out slow and may require a lot of effort by the reader to follow what is happening and/or care about what is happening. THE NIGHT OF THE DANCE is one of those books. After reading 50 pages of this book about a year ago, I put it down and did not pick it up again until it's recent Edgar nomination. With that recommendation I forced myself through the book and , as so very often happens with Edgar books previously discarded, am very glad I did. It took a couple of hundred pages before the pages started flying but fly right by they eventually did.The remains of Sissy Fletcher are found in a pasture in Sleepy Washington County, a rural part of Texas. Sissy disappeared ten years ago after a local Rodeo Dance. It was assumed at that time she left for a large city never to return. Sheriff Dewey Sharpe appears to be in over his head especially when there are several murders around town over the next few days. He enlists the help of ex- Texas Ranger, Jeremiah Spur to work the case, as well as, Deputy Clyde Thomas, a black man who is formerly of the Dallas PD and left the city because of racial bias. Together they must roam the town and try to discover the killer from some pretty unsavory characters.Slow starts can kill a book in it's track- especially those written by a debut author. Kudos to those readers on the Edgar committee who decided to stick this one out. Multiple characters are introduced over the first 100 pages. It may take another 100 pages to become comfortably familiar with them before the pacing can truly pick up. Most of the characters are richly portrayed and carefully constructed. However, there are some problems with several stereotypic characters and some pretty silly dialogue by our local villains Martin and his sidekick, Dud. The pacing is maddeningly slow and the length is at least 100 pages too long. Make no mistake about it. This is a very ambitious and extraordinarily well written debut. Perhaps a bit too ambitious but a worthwhile nominee.

Cork Corcoran, ex-sheriff of Aurora, Minnesota is searching for answers as to the death of Charlotte Kane, a young woman who disappeared several months before and whose body has turned up after the snow has melted. Cork wants to find the killer in order to exonerate his friend, Solemn Winter Moon. Complex interrelationships among the locals complicate the investigation. However, nobody is prepared for Solemn's claim that he has seen Christ in a vision or the miracles that soon follow.William Kent Krueger is one of perhaps a dozen American midlist authors who through his style of writing and creation of characters sets the standard for the rest of the genre. Kent is not capable of writing a bad book. Some may be better than others but the work will always have a high standard. This is of no exception. Well paced, compelling and a satisfying solution make this an all around highly recommended read.

Parker, the antihero thief of Richard Stark (AKA Donald Westlake) is one of my favorite creations. The books are always written with one caper or problem to be solved. This usually includes a set up of a robbery then problems develop. The fun is to see how Parker solves the problems and keeps out of jail.BREAKOUT is a bit of a departure from this formula in that Parker is arrested and jailed in the first chapter. He must try to figure out a way out of, not only jail, but out of town. He is paired with the usual miscreants in which it is difficult to determine who is trustworthy.The book is, as usual, relatively brief, yet always compelling. It can be read in one lengthy sitting. Parker is a cold-blooded thief and killer, yet, Stark breathes such life into him that the reader cannot fail to root for his success. A truly fun read.

Jack Higgins is a very well established thriller writer who started writing decades ago in the same vein as Alastair MacLean and Ian Fleming. They wrote with a spare direct language creating scenes of action with minimal words or characterizations. This is quite different than today's character driven novels. Nonetheless, over the decades, his popularity hasn't waned. His latest work, MIDNIGHT RUNNER, continues the story from last year's EDGE OF MIDNIGHT.Sean Dillan, an ex IRA warrior, in his tenth outing is, once again, pitted against the Rashid family specifically Kate Rashid, the sole heir to the family's fortune. Countess Kate wants to disrupt the stability of the United States economy by disrupting the flow of oil even if it is her oil distribution that is directly affected. The purpose is to discredit President Cazalet's reputation and legacy. With the help of her cousin, Rupert Dauncey, she also wants to enact her revenge on Sean Dillon who is responsible for several deaths in her family. This leads, of course, to an explosive climax as the forces of good and evil clash.Once again, Jack Higgins remains true to form in creating an action thriller with no frills. Adversaries share dinner and drinks prior to heading to the battlefield. Deaths are, again, dealt with quickly and in a matter-of--fact style. Characters are shallow and lack true depth of feeling. Depiction of locale is a bit flimsy but effective enough for the rapidly paced adrenaline charged plot. The purpose of the Higgins books are simply to entertain and on that level they succeed admirably.

There were certain books that we had to read while in school. They were considered great novels and classic literature. They were the sort of books the reader had little doubt of their greatness. The writing was sound and the characters were unforgettable. However, they just simply were not fun or enjoyable books to read. THE FINAL COUNTRY reminds me of that type of book.Milo Milodragovich is a PI and bar owner in Texas. He comes across a large black man, Enos Walker, who offers to buy him a drink. Unbeknownst to Milo, Walker has, apparently, just killed a drug dealer. Later, the police want Milo to track Enos down so they could prosecute him for the murder. He also searches for a beautiful female con artist who might possibly have Milo convicted for murder unless he could clear himself.THE FINAL COUNTRY is actually more of a slice of life or a look at some of the most unpleasant characters a reader might ever come across. It is not a pleasant journey. Yet, there is much poetry in the lyrical writing of Mr. Crumley:&quot;The norther had finally blown itself out by daylight. Dawn came to a wide clear blue sky and cool, dry air. It could have been spring in Eastern Montana. From the green, I could see the flagstone clubhouse where groups of irritated early morning golfers milled around their fancy carts and were obviously bitching about losing their tee times. Like cocaine junkies who had too much money and nothing to do with themselves.&quot;The story, itself, is remarkably dull with the book concentrating on language and character. James Crumley is not a writer for the masses. However, he might very well appeal to the fans of noir fiction.

Private Detective Charlie Parker, once again, is faced with a life-threatening situation. Aaron Faulkner, a fanatical preacher, is in prison under suspicion for the murders committed by his son and daughter (well documented in THE KILLING KIND). He is very likely to get out of prison on bail. Faulkner makes it well known to Parker that he will come after Parker's pregnant lover as soon as he is out. There appears to be little that could be done to legally keep Faulkner in prison.Meanwhile, Parker receives a call from a friend in South Carolina who is defending a young black man accused of raping and killing a young and wealthy white girl. He will almost certainly be convicted and killed unless his innocence is proven. Parker decides to help his friend out with the case. Unfortunately, Parker is now faced with an angry community-- especially the white supremists. Yet in the swamps appears the spectral figure of a woman who might very well be enacting a revenge all her own. Parker must get to the bottom of it.Once again, John Connolly has written a highly suspenseful hard-edged thriller examining the depths of pure evil. Major characters are haunted by the past and are quite unforgettable. The American South tends to play a major part of the work of this Irish writer. It is a mysterious and quite dangerous place as it is depicted in the books of John Connolly. He fills the swamps of South Carolina and Louisiana with a dark beauty that is almost reminiscent of James Lee Burke. However, the writing style is all his own. This is easily one of my favorite series and one that can be read not only for the compelling plot but also for the beauty of the writing.

One of my favorite books of all time is Laurie King's first novel, A GRAVE TALENT. In a sense it is ironic that a supremely talented writer like Ms. King with many other distinguished books under her belt has not yet written a book to outdo her very first effort. With every book that she writes I hope for something to outdo the first effort. With the much heralded KEEPING TOUCH, I thought she might have finally done it. It sounded like she has written her true masterpiece at last. In fact, as I read the first hundred pages I thought that might finally be the case. However, she simply did not know how to keep her work down to a manageable length and unfortunately it does not live up to her first book.Allen Carmichael has returned from Vietnam a psychological mess. It takes him quite some time to pull himself together. When the smoke clears he finds himself in a job in which he kidnaps children from abusive relationships and relocates them elsewhere in a safer and more supportive environment. Jamie is severely abused physically and mentally from his father. After removing him from the situation, Allen notes the father might be onto them thereby placing both Jamie and his foster family in danger. Allen must try to discover the truth about Jamie's father before it is too late.A very promising start in this novel filled with harrowing scenes in Vietnam leads to a disappointing and trying conclusion. The novel goes on at least a hundred pages too long. All the strengths of Ms. King's work is here- the impeccably created characters, the riveting passages, the vivid descriptions of the locale and the intelligent subplots. However, the pacing lags and the length suffers as a result. A potential classic that simply could not maintain the high level consistently throughout.

In London, three recruits prepare for their first day in the Metropolitan Police. However, much to their surprise, a driver picks them up and delivers them to Assistant Commissioner Peter Latham who recruits them for deep undercover work in an effort to ensnare drug dealer, Den Donovan otherwise known as Tango One meaning he is atop the most wanted list. The rest of the story belongs to Den Donovan and the personal problems in his life including the emptying of his bank accounts by his wife's lover who happens to be Den's accountant. As we wonder through Den's trials and tribulations, we wonder if and when the police operatives will make an appearance.This gripping tale provides not only a suspense filled story but also rests on the strong characterizations. Fiction about drug dealers seemed to run rampant several years ago. This tale offers a unique take in that Stephen Leather personalizes Den Donovan into an almost sympathetic figure. We also must try to discover which of the supporting cast are the police operatives. Overall, a very well done book worthy of recognition.

Terry Hughes, working under the orders of the Russian Mafia is assigned to killing fellow gangsters Martin Quinn and Martin's best friend Felix. Unfortunately for Terry things go horribly wrong and it is Martin alone who is left alive after the exchange of gunfire. Wounded and losing consciousness, Martin is arrested and charged with the deaths of his fellow gangsters. Given that he was the target, he decides to become a government witness knowing he is putting not only himself in danger but also the woman he loves. Through flashbacks we learn of the past life and relationships of Martin Quinn.Anthony Lee has written a mainstream novel under the guise of crime fiction. The plot really concerns the character of Martin Quinn. This is the focus- not the weak story line. As such the characters are superbly rendered and the writing style- though the plot is dull and pedantic- is of top quality. The reader cannot help but feel that he or she is reading a very well written novel. Continuing to turn the pages, however becomes more and more difficult.

Douglas Preston is one half of the writing team of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. They have both put out solo efforts this year (Lincoln Child penned DEATH MATCH) and both of them have written entertaining and exciting books perfect for the summer season.Maxwell Broadbent, a wealthy old archeologist who gained his fortune robbing tombs the world over, has called his three sons back to the house. It appears he is dying and wants to see them. When the sons arrive, they find Maxwell missing with all of the treasures. A videotape explains the situation. Maxwell is taking the treasures to a remote tomb somewhere in the world. He will bury himself and the treasure (worth half a billion dollars). It is up to the sons to locate the tomb and retrieve the treasure. Maxwell's purpose is to get his desperate and estranged sons to work together toward a final goal. They must battle soldiers, archeologists and the elements of the tropical rain forest to obtain their inheritance.THE CODEX is a fun, fast paced thriller - silly in its premise and silly in its execution. However, given that it is a pulp type of thriller, it works quite well and should be judged as such. Well recommended for the hammock or poolside.

The hottest book of the season, THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK, is considered by most to be mainstream fiction written under the guise of a mystery. However, after reading this voluminous work, I feel it is an extremely intelligent mystery wrapped in a mainstream package. Nonetheless, this exceptional fictional debut should appeal to all readers and is so well written it literally blows away all other books written in quite some time.Judge Oliver Garland, a black conservative judge and once a nominee for the US Supreme Court, is found dead in his study. The death is felt to be natural. His son,Talcott, a law professor at a prestigious university, receives various messages from those who knew the judge that suggests something sinister might be going on that possibly could have resulted in the Judge's death. At the same time, Talcott's wife, Kimmer, is being strongly considered for a highly prestigious appointment to the US Court of Appeals. As Talcott investigates the mysterious circumstances of his father's activities and associates, many feel Kimmer's chances of getting the position might be in jeopardy. With repeated assurances as to the safety of his family and himself from an old friend of his father, Jack Ziegler, a sinister millionaire with ties to the intelligence community, Tal still finds much in his life at risk. His marriage is unraveling, his position at the school appears to be getting increasingly tenuous, and, in spite of Ziegler, his life may be in danger. With a strong sense of desperation, Tal continues to plod ahead in an effort to find out the truth about his father's death and the life he led.So many of today's crime novels deal with the banalities of life. We learn, whether we want to or nor, the type of toothpaste our main protagonist uses, the cereal they eat, the car they drive and where they most enjoy eating. Stephen Carter, author of several nonfiction books, looks at life's more important issues. Hence, topics such as religion, politics, marriage vows and values and the status of the black middle class in today's society are all interspersed in the intertwining plots of the story. The novel is very rich in character detail; astonishingly so for a first time novelist. However, in spite of the fine writing and superb organization of the book, the weakest link is the mystery subplot itself. The puzzle and problem that must be solved is clever. The suspects well presented. However, near the end, Carter resorts to much stereotypic scenes that after a book so well laid out is quite surprising. I am referring to the scene of the villain holding the gun and divulging all. Yet, the resolution makes perfect sense and is not unnecessarily complex. THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK can be read on many levels. It can be read by the mainstream fiction audience as a treatise on a whole host of real life topics written by a well-known modern philosopher. It can also be read by those looking for a lighter read in just concentrating on the mystery and thriller elements. The cliffhanger type of chapter endings are sure to place this summer's beachcombers. In other words, the book should appeal to a very wide audience. This is the hallmark of a great book and it is surely one that should not be missed.

At an old farmhouse in Chicken Corners, New York-the heart of the Catskill Mountains, three men fire their rifles. Inside the house is a group of immagrant Jews trying to escape the oppressive city for a weekend. As they flee the house in abject terror, one body, that of a woman lies dead at the foot of a staircase. On closer examination, the dead woman is a local resident and was, in fact killed by a bullet to the back of the head shot at close range by a pistol. Local Sheriff Charlie Evans must try to solve not only the murder but who was shooting at the house filled with Jews and why. In getting through this case, Charlie must deal with the locals and their legends including one of the Indian Killer, Tom Quick, a symbol of racial intolerance.Substantially rich characterizations and a very strong sense of place make CATSKILL an above average read. Each character is well thought out with virtually no true stereotypes present. The length was relatively brief but quite adequate to contain the less than compelling plot. However, the strong writing style of debut author, John Hayes, as well as, the satisfactory conclusion make this a recommended read.

Will Dunby is a reporter for the local Droughton, Minnesota newspaper, THE COURIER. His wife, Sandy is in a coma after she apparently tried to commit suicide by driving her car over a cliff. Will and Sandy had a troubled marriage which prompted Sandy to have had an affair with a local physician, Tommy Moylan. When Moylan's body is found with two bullet wounds shortly after Sandy's car wreck, Will becomes a possible suspect for the murder. He must try to prove his innocence.There is much to be admired in this debut novel from Mike Nichols, a reporter for the MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL. Characters are well fleshed out and their dialogue highly realistic. Especially impressive was not only the compelling plot, but the multiple twists and turns it takes to the surprising ending. Not only should this book be considered a murder mystery, but, it is also a suspense thriller and a legal thriller in that courtroom scenes truly make the book unable to be put down. Mike Nichols paces his novel well and certainly doesn't wear out his welcome by keeping it a perfect length-- not too long. This is another entry onto the short list of the year's best first mysteries.

The latest 87th precinct novel finds Steve Carella and company trying to locate the kidnapped pop singer, Tamar Valparaiso. Tamar was kidnapped in the middle of a publicity appearance on a boat. Time appears to be running out.There have been better and there have been worse novels of the 87th precinct. However, any book by Ed McBain is a welcome sight and this one proves no exception. It is unclear whether we are dealing with a more humorous book or one a bit grittier. The ending proves the later is the case. Well worth the read.

Hope Stevens disappeared from the witness protection program and from agent Roland Larson's life. The problem is that Larson fell in love with her and wants to find her again. When the list of protected witnesses disappears into the hands of the mob who want Hope dead, Larson must find her in order to save her life- and the life of a daughter he never knew he had.CUT AND RUN is a very fast paced novel that starts slow but gains increasing momentum. As the action picks up, the chapter length shortens thereby creating quick vignettes. This is the same technique James Patterson uses to keep his books lightening quick. There are many faults with the book including the stereotypic characters. The main purpose is pure entertainment and in this it readily succeeds.

This is ingenious marketing by the publisher of the phenomenally successful THE DAVINCI CODE. Simon and Schuster decided to re-release all of Dan Brown's previous novels in both paperback and hardcover. ANGEL AND DEMONS, the book that introduced Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist and hero of DAVINCI, has hit the upper reaches of the New York Times Bestseller List in both hardback and paperback at the same time. The public obviously hungers for more of this character and the intricate religion based thrillers.At CERN, a Swiss research lab, a scientist is found dead with the word 'illuminati' branded on his chest. This refers to an ancient and secret scientific organization banned by the Catholic Church. Missing from the lab is a small amount of newly discovered antimatter. Enough, however, to destroy a small city. Robert Langdon is brought in to help investigate because he is a world expert on the Illuminati. With the help of Vittoria Vetra, daughter of the deceased scientist, Langdon investigates the murder. Their paths take them directly to Vatican City where the Illuminati threaten to kill five cardinals just as a pope is being elected. After killing the cardinals, The Illuminati will unleash the antimatter inside the Vatican thereby destroying the center of the Catholic faith. Can they be stopped?ANGELS AND DEMONS is a fun and furiously fast read. The elements that proved so successful in THE DAVINCI CODE are all present in this earlier work. THE DAVINCI CODE's success is probably rooted in the hidden aspects of the life of Jesus. After all, the recent movie, THE PASSION, proves unequivocally that Jesus sells. ANGELS AND DEMONS does not have quite the same powerful premise. In this book we deal with the dichotomy of science vs. Religion in explaining the origins of the universe. A character in this book sets out a logical and provocative argument that both science and religion can exist side by side. As in DAVINCI, the pacing is relentless almost from page one. Villains are larger than life as are the heroes that must save mankind reminiscent of any good thriller. However, the action and the logic that propel the action are so farfetched that the book is downright silly but also highly entertaining.

After bombing a federal building, a group of &quot;patriots&quot; from Idaho take credit for the bombing. When the army takes action against this militia, a battle is fought on US territory with the resultant loss of lives. Within the context of this battle is Lieutenant Nathan Dixon who lives in the shadow of his father, a decorated general. His stepmother, Jan Fields, is covering the war as an anchorwoman. These characters serve as an anchor around which the battles rage.Harold Coyles has written nine military thrillers. He has seventeen years of service in the military which is reflected in the realism of the battle scenes, as well as, the military strategy. His novels are known for their realistic nightmare scenarios. This, of course, is no exception. Characterizations are not a strength of his as they are all quite superficial with average dialogue. He pacing is interesting in that the story starts out slow as the characters are introduced and the battle is set up. Then, chapters get shorter, the action jumps around and the pacing picks up as we head into war.

Prostitutes are dying in the Seattle area. They are being found in a similar manner- nude on a bed with arms crossed like a mummy. The cause of death appears to be an exotic drug. Leading the investigation is Detective Karen Able. Her sometime boyfriend, Jon Kirk, reporter for the Seattle Times is also investigating the case. Jon nicknames the killer &quot;the sandman&quot; due to his mode of killing his victims. The killer decides to communicate through Jon via phone calls. When it is discovered that a professor of Anatomy at the local medical school is missing, the police believe they finally have a suspect. The problem is to now capture him before he kills again. This must bring Karen and Jon into harms way to solve the case.There is so much that I liked in this first effort. The writing flows well with a well paced and compelling plot. Characters, especially the two main protagonists are well sketched and quite likable. The others are also well done but the villain is a characature. The book concerns drugs and drug research so it was a bit disappointing that the author did not write about what he knew best at least in this work- mainly cancer treatment. Probably the biggest problem with the book is the lack of originality. Serial killer novels are probably a dime a dozen according to the major publishers. To succeed after so many others before, it is vital that there be a spark of originality. At least something that has not been written before. I could never overcome the feeling that I have read this book before in some other form. Therefore, I am impressed by Dr. Griffin's writing style and characterizations but decidedly not with the originality. He might be worth watching. We shall see with his subsequent work.

After a limited nuclear explosion of a cruise ship, as well as, the appearance of a disease in the United States that paralyzes the victim leading to a deformity of the hands and feet (similar to a donkey and called The Pinocchio Syndrome), the rating of the US President is at an all time low. As high ranking US officials start contracting the disease, a crisis develops and the Presidency appears threatened. Colin Goss, an ultraconservative, feels that Mideast terrorists are to blame and would think nothing of wiping out a billion people. His popularity is soaring as the President's is crashing. Investigating the disease is reporter Karen Embry. As she investigates she begins to uncover a vast conspiracy with millions of lives at stake.There appears to be a dumbing down of thrillers by first time authors and this one is one of the dumbest I have read in quite some time. Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining. The disease described in the story is quite silly and the reason the disease is spread is even sillier. With better material, David Zeman may be a writer to watch. However, in this case, I would skip this debut effort. Rating: C.

At a construction site in Lower Manhattan, a grizzly discovery is made. Thirty-six bodies are discovered in an excavated basement passageway. The bodies are those of children dead for over one hundred years. At that location was a Cabinet of Curiosities or a museum of oddities quite reminiscent of a circus freak show or, perhaps today's Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums found in so many city's tourist centers. A mysterious FBI Special Agent named Pendergast enlists the help of Nora Kelly, researcher for the Museum of Natural History to attempt to get to the bottom of the crimes. Nora wonders what relevance this old crime can be to the modern FBI until soon after the press picks up the story, the murders begin again. Pendergast and Nora must try to solve the crimes before they themselves become the killer's next victim.THE ALIENIST by Caleb Carr is one of my favorite mystery novels. It is rooted in the past-New York City of the 1890s where a serial killer is haunting the streets killing prostitutes. Surprisingly, this book, although set in modern times, is quite reminiscent of THE ALIENIST for several reasons. The ties to the 19th century is crucial to the story; a team is assembled to fight the killer and the killer is quite ingenious. They are also very long books that move at an incredibly fast pace. THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES simply cannot be put down. The Museum of Natural History long a Mecca for families has in it's basement a nightmarish maze that becomes the setting for one of the most terrifying scenes in the book. Chinatown, Riverside Drive and Central Park are all used to a chilling effectiveness as the chase for the killer is on. In spite of a conclusion that might be a bit too outlandish, I definitely recommend this as one of the most entertaining books this year.

Scot Harvath, ex-navy SEAL and current Secret Service agent, is seeking the head of a terrorist organization, the one responsible for the kidnapping of the President in the last book. He finds himself up against Hashim Nidal, son of the dead terrorist Abu Nidal. The son, apparently a highly skilled operative and assassin, is involved in a plot to threaten both Israel and the US. It is up to Scot to follow, capture and kill this terrorist before he can bring his plan into reality. The chase takes him all over the world.Brad Thor in his second endeavor shows he has what it takes to write the penultimate international thriller. The military trained larger than life hero, a love interest, the history of the free world at stake, exotic settings well described, and the latest military gadgets. It is all great fun. This is a quick easy read and one that doesn't require too many brain cells. It is perfect for the upcoming summer months.

Thomas H. Cook is a genius. I do not recall saying that about any other writer I have ever reviewed. There are some fine writers out there whose work is consistently excellent. They are highly regarded by all who read the genre. Writers such as James Lee Burke, Mike Connelly, Dennis Lehane and others who write a superior novel in a style easily distinguished from others. However, Tom Cook not only writes a novel as good as any of the others, but, his style changes from one book to the next. Perhaps this is why he is not as wildly popular as some others. One never knows what to expect. Tom Cook has gone through phases where books consecutively written are somewhat similar in style and tone, such as the great BREAKHEART HILL or the Edgar winning, THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR- historical dramas evaluating love and loss. Now he is in a phase of writing modern crime novels.PERIL concerns Sara Labriola, wife of a mobster's son. She leaves her husband, Tony, to start a new life away from her husband and especially away from her father in law, Leonardo. She lives with fears unknown to us and wants nothing more than to disappear. However, Leonardo refuses to let her run away and insists on having her found and punished. To accomplish this task he enlists his henchman, Caruso. Tony, fearing what his evil father will do to Sara, if found, hires his own man to find her. So the novel becomes a game of several cats and only one mouse.The novel has a unique structure. It is told from the viewpoint of seven to eight different characters. Initially, each story is unique and quite disjointed. However, as we proceed through the novel, the individual stories get shorter and shorter thereby quickening the pacing and eventually as all comes together in the end flows from one narrative to the next. It is a unique structure and quite ingenious. The only weakness in the novel is the somewhat stereotypic depiction of the evil Leo Labriola and the ludicrous coincidence of Sara's choice of a bar to work in. Truly breathtaking.

Smoke Dugan is living a life in hiding. As a former explosives expert to the mob, he is on the lam for stealing 2.5 million dollars from a mob boss before killing him. But Smoke is a good guy. He was angry because the bomb he created was used to bring down a commercial airline. Now, he is living in Portland Maine and has a girlfriend Lola Bell. The mob has caught up with Smoke in the form of a trio of deadly hitmen. Lola could be used as a pawn- so they think. They are just not aware that she is well versed in the area of martial arts. What ensues is a thrilling semi-comic bloodbath.SMOKED is all about the characters in the same vein as an Elmore Leonard novel. Sure there is a decent and rollicking plot. The strength is the portrayals of both the bad and the good as real people each with their own set of problems. They all have great depth so that even the most wicked come off as semi-human instead of the usual cartoonish stereotypes. From the reader's standpoint the book is pure fun. The author truly knows how to pace his stories. This is an impressive debut and comes well recommended.

While recovering, he is visited by Vanessa Kohler, a lady from his past. It is a past he would like to forget. Unfortunately it does come back to haunt him with many lives at stake.Phillip Margolin has written a fun, fast thriller that is not truly memorable but would be perfect for the pool or plane. He knows how to pace his story and does a reasonable job at humanizing his characters no matter how terrible they might be. The writing is strong and sure with nothing awkward about it. The author is an experienced teller of suspense tales and it truly shows.

Joe Trona suffered a terrible injury as a child. His father threw acid on his face leaving him horribly scarred. It is a scar that has affected his life since then. After being adopted by Will and Mary Ann Trona, his life improved considerably. As the book opens, Will is a prominent politician in Orange County and Joe is his right hand man. Unfortunately, as Will goes on an assignment, he is killed in an ambush as Joe helplessly watches. Joe, of course, will stop at nothing to find Will's killers. He must delve into Will's past to get the answers.What is especially impressive about this particular work is the superb writing. In fact, this is easily one of the best written works of the year. Joe Trona is an unforgettable character. He is brought vibrantly alive though both actions and dialogue. The plot is reasonably compelling, yet, at times, frustratingly complex. The slightly excessive length served to slow down the pacing of the story. This is not my favorite of the Best Novel Edgar nominees, however, the superb writing cannot be denied nor should the Edgar.

What can one say about yet again another serial killer novel. Authors are desperately trying to put a new spin on a very old and tired formula. However, Jeff Lindsay may have succeeded in making his a bit more offbeat than the vast majority.Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter analyst on the Miami PD. He is also a very disturbed man who just so happens to be a serial killer. However, his victims are serial killers themselves whether they are priests who kill children or mentally deranged janitors, Dexter finds them and kills them with great enjoyment. He now appears to be up against a killer who murders women leaving their cut up and bloodless bodies in neat little packages for the police to find. However, the killer is onto Dexter in that Dexter is finding clues in his kitchen and car indicating the killer knows who he is. To make matters worse, Dexter is not sure if, while he supposedly dreams, he is in fact killing. Needless to say, he tries to help his sister get ahead in the police department by giving her insight into the killing- things that only another killer would know.There is a sense of originality with Dexter being a 'lovable serial killer'. He is an original creation and a unique voice in crime fiction. The good idea, however, eventually begins to wear as thin as the uneven plot. Stereotypes abound and in spite of the uniqueness of the main protagonist, the other characters are routine creations. The conclusion is highly unrealistic and comes virtually out of nowhere. However, the length of the story is manageable and the book well edited.

Louis Kincaid, former Detective now a PI, living on the southwest coast of Florida comes upon a skull of a child washed up on a beach after a storm. A few days later a corpse of a woman washes onto the beach. Kincaid feels there might be a connection. He is visited later by a woman who asks him to investigate her father. It seems she found hidden in her father's house two articles cut out concerning the recent death, as well as, the disappearance of a young woman many years ago. There may be a serial killer around and that killer just might be the woman's father.Most impressive in this entertaining work is the very rapid pacing at least in the initial third of the book. As the investigation became more complex, the pacing slowed considerably but the characters became more vivid. The last third concerned the secret of the Island of Bones. This is where the problems began for me. Initially I thought we were into a serial killer novel but a really good one. It is as though the authors were deciding as they went along where the plot would take them in that there was such a drastic change in the tempo and the tone of the book. I really did not appreciate the secret of the island and found it more Nancy Drew than realistic. Well written though and an enjoyable enough way to spend a few hours.

RESURRECTION MEN by Ian Rankin (Little, Brown, $19.95)Ian Rankin's series about the Scottish detective, John Rebus, has been one of the most popular series written over the last decade. It has brought a legion of fans and great riches to Ian. He now calls J.K. Rowling and Alexander McCall Smith his neighbors. What has brought him to this high level is the consistent excellence of his very long, very complex and all absorbing books.After an incident of insubordination, Rebus is sent to &quot;school&quot; with other problem detectives to rehabilitate them and resurrect their image. Hence, the term Resurrection Men referring to the group of detectives Rebus is grouped with. As an exercise, they are given an old and cold murder to solve. It concerns the bludgeoning death of a drug dealer. At the same time, Siobhan Clark, Rebus' old partner and friend, is working on a case of an art dealer's murder. In both cases the interpersonal relationships of the victims to those around them become the keys to the cases. Surprisingly, the two cases begin to overlap as do the two investigations.This is the first Rankin book I have not read at publication. The reason I stopped reading the books is the fact that they are long and slow reads demanding so much time from the reader. More importantly, they are depressing works that are so similar to each other. I just can't get over the feeling that Ian Rankin is writing the same book again and again. He has his own formulaic style. This one is no exception. There are so many characters introduced that a list of characters at the front of the book proves to be a major necessity. This can become especially daunting to a first time reader of the Rebus series. It all takes some getting used to. In fact, the story doesn't really start clicking until well over one hundred pages. Once everything is in place, however, the book flows beautifully and quite seamlessly becomes all encompassing including superbly rendered characterizations and the striking immediacy of the locale. Pacing is still a problem for me in these books but their true excellence cannot be denied.

In Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, bodies are washing up on shore. They are the dead bodies of refugees from the Dominican Republic who were killed while trying to flee their country and gain entry into the United States. Sheriff Luis Gonzalo, of a nearby town, helps with the victims. He notices one man has been killed with a head wound that looks suspiciously like it was caused by a hammer. He suspects murder. However, Gonzalo is forcibly removed from the beach by local police who want to assume complete control. Upon following up on the dead man, he discovers that the body has disappeared and nobody knows where it went. As he searches for the truth, Gonzalo finds himself threatened and his family in danger.Steven Torres does an admirable job in his first effort. I always admire relative brevity in a debut work. However, this book is a bit too brief. There were several subplots that deserved some further exploring such as the fate of the ill fated Dominican boat pilot who we meet in the first chapter. Characters range from the well developed to the stereotypic. The plot was reasonably well paced and compelling enough keep the pages turning. A mild recommendation.

CLEA'S MOON comes to us with high expectations. In Great Britain it has won the CWA Debut Dagger for fiction which is not the award for best first novel (The Creasey Award) but judgment based on a 500 word synopsis of the book and the opening pages up to 3000 words . (I anticipate a nomination for the Creasey Award this year.) Though first published in Great Britain, the author is American and the characters and setting most assuredly are as well. It is a gem and another one of the year's best debuts.John Ray Horn is a former star of B-movie westerns. Along with his &quot;Tonto&quot; or sidekick Indian friend Joseph Mad Dog, they provided many hours of enjoyment for young moviegoers. Now, however, Horn is out of the movie business after a prison term that resulted in a divorce. He works for his old friend, Mad Dog, collecting debts for the Indian's casino business. One day, Horn is contacted by an old friend, Scotty, who wants to show him some his father's pictures which he discovered after his father's death. The photos reveal very young girls in provocative positions. One of the photos is of Clea, Horn's former stepdaughter. When Horn contacts his ex-wife inquiring about Clea, he is told she has disappeared. Horn then pursues her. The search takes him to the dark and forbidden underworld of Los Angeles in the late 1940s.CLEA'S MOON is an exceptional novel and what is even more remarkable is that it is a first novel. It runs on all cylinders right out of the starting gate. Characters, plot, pacing all combine to perfection in this wonderfully atmospheric novel. Horn, being a faded cowboy movie star, is an interesting main protagonist. What is especially intriguing throughout most of the book is the question as to why he was in prison. We learn the answer late in the book. Nothing is left to chance. The search for Clea propels the story along. However, once she is found, the question arises as to why she ran away. Pages fly by as we find out the stunning truth. Edward Wright is a journalist and, like so many journalists before him, has written a superb debut novel.

Jeffrey Deaver is a bestselling author of detective thrillers. His most famous creation is Lincoln Rhyme the quadraplegic detective. He is highly acclaimed and very well established. Therefore, it is a bit of a surprise to find him nominated in the best paperback original category. This category usually consists of either authors just establishing themselves or those that cannot get a hardback contract for whatever reason. Jeffrey Deaver comes out with at least one bestseller a year. His work is, typically, a high octane thriller in which the action doesn't let up. This work is quite different from what he usually writes. In some ways it is superior.John Pelham is a filmmaker who has decided to film a documentary on the residents of Hell's Kitchen, a tough neighborhood in Manhattan. He chooses Ettie Washington, an elderly black woman living in a tenement, as being his eyes and ears. He interviews her and invests hours of taping. AS he goes to interview her one last time, an explosive fire rages from the basement of the tenement. Both Pelham and Ettie barely escape with their lives. Ettie, incredibly, becomes a suspect on hiring a professional to set the fire for insurance purposes. However, it soon becomes apparent to both the police and Pelham that a serial pyromaniac is on the loose with the stakes going up with each successive fire.Jeffrey Deaver has changed his writing style from his other books. This is a much more introspective work. The plot moves along at a much more lugubrious fashion. Characters are more well rounded than a typical Deaver novel. However, the style of writing remains superior and the plot is certainly compelling enough to keep the pages turning but not compelling enough to keep the reader turning the pages late at night in lieu of sleep. A solid nomination.

On sanctuary Island off the coast of Maine lives an odd assortment of characters. Joe Dupree, a physical giant is head of the local police. He has his eyes on Marianne, a single mom of a six year old boy. There is a retarded youth, as well as a crusty old painter among many others. The island, however, is haunted with spirits from centuries ago when a settlement on the island was wiped out by a crazed maniac with a group of local Indians. What the islanders don't know is that the island will be attacked once again. This time by Moloch, an fugitive killer hell bent on killing his wife, Marianne, after she turned him into the police while stealing his money. Can the islanders hold them off?Surprisingly John Connelly has drifted off into the occult. True, the basic essence of this very well written novel is a crime. However, the solution lies well into the realm of the occult. Consider this, perhaps, a Stephen King type of work that lacks Mr. King's ability to convey ordinary life. The book is a bit too long and the ending predictable and easily seen several hundred pages before it occurs. The intermingling of ghostly spirits removes quite a bit of the realism, yet, there are some interesting characters created such as the giant, Joe Dupree. Moloch is a stereotypic madman way out of control as is the length of this book. Worth reading however, in that it is quite entertaining.

The wealthy are dying in Manhattan. A serial arsonist is setting their bodies on fire and watching as they burn to death. On the trail of the killer are NYPD Detectives Ben Stack and Rica Lopez. The killer is aware of their presence and calls them to alert them to the killing and to prevent the fire from spreading any further. They desperately must seek the identity of the killer and discover what the victims have in common, if anything.John Lutz is a veteran mystery writer with many previous books published. He has previously won the Edgar for a short story in 1987. The experience is quite evident in both the pacing and the rhythm of the story. Events move seamlessly and inexorably to the conclusion which is both clever and surprising. Ben and Rica, the main protagonists, are engaging. Other characters are well portrayed but lack the emotional depth of these two. The story is rapidly paced. It is a very impressive work and well worthy of the Edgar nomination.

In New York of the 1980s, Michael Forsythe is an Irish thug working for a crime boss, Darkey White. His life is on the edge and whatever fun is to be had, violence is just around the corner. His lover, Bridget, just so happens to be the girlfriend of his boss. This gets him into some major trouble as Michael and three of his cronies are sent down to Mexico for a drug sale. After being set up, presumably by Darkey, they wind up in prison. After a harrowing escape, Michael, the only survivor, finds meaning in his life- revenge against those who set them up.This debut novel is both beautifully written but problematic. There is a distinct inconsistency in the method of narration. Initially the novel is episodic as we get to know the characters. It then becomes nonlinear as we go back into Michael's life. From the prison on it becomes a linear story. It seems as if the author could not maintain a single method of narration perhaps due to lack of experience. The author also chose not to use any quotation marks during the numerous dialogues which can be a bit distracting. Nonetheless, characters are so beautifully rendered as is the locale with much poetic lyricism. This is a very solid crime novel.

Wilson Bledsoe is a Dartmouth professor acclaimed the world over while sporting a Nobel Prize and most recently the $2 million dollar Devonshire prize for his work in the science field. His murder on the way home from a party celebrating his latest achievement is what sets up the action in this debut thriller. Wilson's brother, Sterling is conveniently an FBI agent who investigates the case. He discovers a problem with dead blackbirds in the area and tries to tie the murder of his brother to the presence of the birds. The connection may appear tenuous but when Sterling becomes a suspect in his brother's death, there is a much greater sense of urgency to solve the crime.Ian Smith, an NBC medical correspondent has written a competent debut mystery novel. Well plotted and paced with adequate characterizations, there is much here to entertain the masses at the beach or by the pool.

Michael Palmer is a best-selling writer of medical thrillers. In this, his latest work, Dr. Michael Rutledge of Belinda, West Virginia has returned home following the death of his wife and father. He is convinced the toxic waste of the local mining company is responsible and wants to prove it. Going against the local powers can prove to be quite dangerous. Meanwhile, pathologist, Nicki Solari, is looking into the death of a friend of hers who died of an unusual illness. She travels to Belinda, her friend's hometown to seek answers. Nicki eventually meets Michael and they realize they might have a common goal.In another plot line, Ellen Kroft questions the safety of a new super vaccine.

After an unwelcome visitor threatens her child, Ellen tries to get to the bottom of the threat. The path, once again, leads to Belinda, West Virginia. Eventually, Michael, Nicki and Ellen join forces to fight a common, yet, dangerous, enemy.FATAL is a fun, fast reading novel which questions the underlying motivation of getting vaccines on the market. What is especially impressive about this work is that ,in spite of having a strong agenda, the author manages to never wane from telling an exciting tale. Of course, there are some stereotypic characters present given that it takes place in the backwoods of West Virginia, however, overall they are a believable bunch. Michael Palmer fully understands what makes a thriller successful as is evidenced here.

Michael Stone, forensic psychologist, is asked to lead a group session at Nelson's Point Correctional Facility, Vermont. The group consists of sexual predators who suspiciously appear to be hiding something from her. Michael is replacing Eileen Steelwater who was fired after being discovered having sex with one of the inmates. Michael wonders why Eileen would break her ethical code. Violence breaks out in the prison. The group Michael leads becomes increasingly suspect. What are they hiding and why?Anna Salter's writing is reminiscent of the early excellent work of Sue Grafton, Sara Paretsky and Patricia Cornwell. This is a character rich work that never delves into the excess. The minutia of Michael's life is kept to a minimum in favor of plot progression. Michael Stone is a likable character and her supporting staff reasonably realistic. Ms. Salter, a forensic psychologist, herself, manages to mix just the right amount of fact with fiction so as to never appear preachy. The story, itself, is both compelling and well paced. This is not the most exciting of the nominated books in this category, but, it is the best written and my choice for the Edgar.

There is a certain sense of realism in the books of George Pelecanos which hits right to the heart of the human emotion. The characters are sparked with the heat of life in situations that reek of reality. Pelecanos novels jump around in time but place seems quite stable with a Washington DC setting. In this case we are in the year 1959 and 1968- a time of great turmoil and change in the civil rights movement.HARD REVOLUTION is a multifaceted story with several subplots occurring at the same time. Derek Strange is a police officer just getting his feet wet as a rookie in the edgy black section of DC. He worries about his older brother who runs with the wrong crowd, yet, is trying to rehabilitate himself but may not have the moral fortitude to do so. Detective Frank Vaughn looks for the killers of a young black man- the victim of a hit and run. While the three killers plan a robbery they hope will make them enough to ease their financial woes. All this is told with the background of the civil rights movement and the neighborhood which is like a powder keg ready to explode.Movies and pop songs give the story its timeline, as well as its character. Nobody can argue with the writing skills of George Pelecanos. He is right up there with James Lee Burke in being one of the most technically perfect writers in the genre. It is the characters which give his books such a distinguished aire. The stories move quickly and all characters are humanized- the bad and the good and that is rare indeed. One of the year's best as usual with Mr. Pelecanos.

Lydia Strong has a gift of acutely accurate intuition. She can find clues that elude others. She helped determine the killer of her mother fifteen years ago and, now, as a thirty year old woman, she is a bestselling author of true crime books and a consultant for law enforcement. Young women are disappearing in the Santa Fe area. Lisa suspects something is very wrong and calls her friend, PI Jeffrey Mark, ex FBI agent, into town for his help. The two investigate the deaths and soon realize a serial killer may be at work. Things heat up when the killer targets Lydia as his next victim.Lisa Miscione has written a very good first novel worthy of widespread acclaim. She has the ability to write with great beauty in describing the landscape and setting of this character rich debut. There is enough of a feeling of underlying dread to keep the reader's interest at all times and the relatively rapid pacing also contributed to the pages flying. Overall a well recommended debut.

It is quite difficult to review NANO. As the author clearly states, this is both a demonstration and a precautionary tale. It is what might be possible when nanotechnology reaches its potentially full fruition. The emphasis is, therefore, not on rich memorable characters but on way over the top science fiction like events. It is a relatively weak attempt at writing a competent thriller.Jennifer Rayne, a journalist for a technological magazine, is a front row witness to the assassination of the world's richest man, Mitchell Swain, as he is about to announce to the world the development of a new technology which will alter the course of mankind and the universe itself. It appears that virtually nobody knows what Swain was about to say and Jen makes it her job to find out. She discovers that John Merrak worked closely with Swain and eventually finds him just as government agents do. She witnesses his resistance to arrest. Using nanoparticles, John manages to escape while the agents virtually disappear. So begins a wild journey as John and Jen fight off both the government and rogue agents anxious to be the first to harness the full power of nanotechnology. At stake is the universe itself.Knowing full well his tale is way over the top, John Robert Marlow writes one of the longest afterwards I have read in quite some time in a fictional novel. He justifies his story as being well within the realm of possibility with future development of nanotechnology. Under the context of this information, the story is quite terrifying. However, in evaluating this book strictly as a thriller, it is quite lacking in both a plausible plot steeped in realism and fully defined characters. There is so much explanation in the book concerning the nanotechnology, that, at times, it reads like a scientific treatise and about as exciting. Even if nanotechnology is theoretically possible, it seems highly unlikely the events in this book will ever be even remotely possible.

Unfortunately, they discover that the uncle may have inadvertently murdered someone and he is being harassed. When a horse rides onto the farm through an early morning mist with a dead body on it's back, things turn especially ugly.Gillian Linscott succeeds in bringing the Lake District of a century ago very much alive. The well drawn characters make full use of the landscape as Nell tries to get to the bottom of the murders. However, the story lacks true interest or progression. In a sense, it resonates with the heritage of the countryhouse mystery but without the sense of fun. Overall, a very ordinary effort.

If the authors Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thompson ever met Dan Brown author of THE DAVINCI CODE, they should get down on their knees and thank him for making their book a hot property. Otherwise, there is little this droll, dull and pedantic debut has to offer.At Princeton University, in 1999, two students are trying to solve a mystery of an ancient Renaissance text called the Hypnerotomacia Poliphilli. One of the students, Tom Sullivan, had a father who was obsessed with the book and his friend Paul Harris is writing his thesis based on it. However to solve the mystery of the book requires an all encompassing diligence that threatens Tom's relationship with his girlfriend. More importantly, however, when an academician associated with the book is murdered, he realizes it might also cost him his life.There must be a real need among publishing houses to publish novels about ancient books that answers important questions with characters that have a life and death need to know these answers. Make no mistake about it- this is no Davinci Code- not even remotely close. The plot is sanguine, the research sloppy, the characters flat and the pacing repetitious. In fact, this is a wholly uninteresting debut and one that demanded to be read just based on publicity. Avoid.

Jack Valentine is a British agent who accepts the mission to locate the body of an American agent in Ireland, killed in 1974, and remove whatever papers are on it. He is joined by an old friend of his, Liam Mellows, wanted as a possible informer by the IRA. Both getting the papers off the dead body and keeping a step ahead of Liam's pursuers is beginning to get more and more of an impossible task.This winner of the newly formed CWA Steel Dagger Award for thriller writing is actually a dull, dreary and dreadfully slow read. There are moments of sheer terror. However, the concentration is on realistic characterizations with great depth. The author succeeds in that regard. The characters lack true empathy which leads to apathy. The bottom line is that as a thriller THE SIRIUS CROSSING simply doesn't thrill.

Greg Iles is one of my favorite writers of crime fiction. His books are full of complex characters and plots that range from strong crime fiction to the thriller sub genre. Sometimes the stories are a bit farfetched such as a woman finding her identical twin on an art gallery wall while visiting the Orient. The twin was apparently murdered quite some time before. However, the stories always stayed within the realm of possibilties--until now.In SLEEP NO MORE, we enter the realm of the supernatural. John Waters is a geologist who searches for oil in the Natchez, Mississippi area. He is married to a woman he loves and remains loyal to in spite of the fact that physically she has withdrawn from him after a couple of miscarriages. They do, however, have a young daughter. A beautiful local Realtor attempts to seduce John and claims she is really his old girlfriend who was raped and killed years before in New Orleans. How this could be defies all logic--yet events occur which might very well lend credence to this claim. As this &quot;spirit&quot; travels from person to person, John soon finds, not only all his friends and family at risk, but his very freedom and quite possibly his life.One must buy into the premise that a life force can move from one body to another before even attempting to read this otherwise exciting and well written suspense tale. In fact, in terms of pure entertainment, I would rate this book an &quot;A-&quot;. Greg Iles has written his usual compelling tale full of sympathetic and well rounded realistic characters. There is a long ago murder that percolates through the story line, hence, the attachment to the crime fiction genre. However, the basic premise actually reclassifies this book to the supernatural or even horror genre. Authors, to maintain their core base of fan readers, should attempt to remain within their genre. This, at least, would allow the readers to know what to expect from the author. When an author leaves the genre, he or she risks losing fans who have previously been loyal. Andrew Klaven and Walter Mosely are two examples that come immediately to mind. In this work, Iles steps way beyond the, at times, hazy distinction between the possible and the impossible. The supernatural element almost is cheating. Therefore judging this as a crime novel, the rating is C+ .

One of the first hot thrillers of 2004 is this very clever suspense novel that takes place among the giants of the tech world. Adam Cassidy is an underacheiving employee of a major technological company. He is able to break into the company's charge account and is responsible for putting together a retirement party for a worker on the loading dock. When the upper echelon apprehend him, he is threatened with imprisonment unless he can steal the identity and the workings of a secret project at Trion, a competing tech company. Adam soon proves himself up to the task. However, as he gets closer to the secret he is more and more at risk while seriously questioning where his loyalties lie. The real fun is seeing how it will all turn out in the end.Why is this book so successful? Joseph Finder takes his time in developing his main character, Adam Cassidy. We are slowly and carefully brought into Adam's entire world and feel great empathy for him. As Adam enters into Trion, we are with him every step of the way. We know everything he knows and only what he knows. This facilitates the increasing suspense. Further, pages fly as we wonder how Adam will get out of his predicament. Supporting characters are not nearly so well rounded yet they serve their function. Finally the conclusion has enough twists and surprises that the book is closed with a great feeling of satisfaction. The bottom line- a very good value for the entertainment dollar.

In Miami, a serial killer is stalking the streets. The murders appear to be ritualistic and are quite bloody. Detective Jimmy Paz is assigned the case. Jane Doe, a young black woman with a mysterious past, is drawn inexorably into the case as the murders appear directed to her. She is hiding from her past. Why?TROPIC OF NIGHT is one of the most audacious and complicated books I have read in quite some time. The author is trying to write mainstream fiction under the guise of a serial killer novel. In my mind, the novel doesn't work on any level. The pace is meandering as the writer tries to exercise artistic freedom and perhaps to &quot;rise&quot; above the genre. The plot is almost indecipherable. Characters? Who really cares. Many say this is one of the year's best. I feel quite the opposite.

Superlatives after superlatives are used to describe the books of Mike Connelly over the years. When reading his books, the reader will immediately realize they are like no other. He is poetic at the same time as being a superlative storyteller. The vast majority of writers simply do not know when to shut down the lyricism and get on with the tale that must be told. Hence, in the middle of a highly compelling beginning the reader is given the following:"As he read through the catalogs of the city's horrors, Bosch felt a familiar power begin to take hold of him and move in his veins again. Only an hour back on the job and he was already chasing a killer. It didn't matter how long ago the blood had fallen. There was a killer in the wind and Bosch was coming. Like the prodigal son returning, he knew he was back in his place now. He was baptised again in the waters of the one true church. The church of the blue religion. And he knew that he would find his salvation in those who were long lost, that he would find it in these musty bibles where the dead lined up in columns and there were ghosts on every page."Take that, James Lee Burke! One of the major differences between these two exceptional writers is that Mike Connelly writes a different book almost every time. They might differ in narrative voice or point of view. He might write a series or a stand alone. His next book will be unlike any of the others with more of a legal thriller- perhaps a courtroom drama. This one is a pure police procedural as opposed to a true thriller. There is the usual Connelly twist in the end just to keep things interesting.Detective Harry Bosch returns to the LAPD. He is assigned to work with an old partner Kizmyn Rider in the Open Unsolved department- old unsolved cases. His first concerns a sixteen year old girl who was found murdered in 1988 behind her home of a gunshot wound. The reason the case is reopened is that the gun found with the girl has some blood from the owner and with new DNA detection techniques, it appears that the elusive killer might finally be identified. Of course, things are never that easy. What follows is a complex police procedual almost in real time as we follow Bosch every step of the way. Once again Mike Connelly shows his mastery in the field of crime fiction by writing one of the best books of the year and possibly one of his best in several years.

Miami lawyer Jack Swytek has just won a large verdict for an ex girlfriend, Jessie Merrill. Jesse was diagnosed with a deadly disease with only a two year survival. A company agreed to pay her one and a half million dollars in a settlement to sell them her three million dollar life insurance policy. When it is discovered that she was mistakenly diagnosed and is actually quite healthy, the company wants their money back. She refuses and Jack wins the lawsuit. However, things go quickly downhill when Jessie tells Jack someone is trying to kill her. Jack is soon made very aware of the danger he is in and must get to the bottom of the deaths if he is to survive.James Grippando is a well known writer of suspenseful thrillers. This is the first book I have read by him. Impressive is his command of characterization and plot progression. It is a well paced and fun read. However, the conclusion, though surprising, is a bit of a letdown with a very long exposition necessitated by the fact that it comes out of left field. I reserve judgment on this author overall until reading another book by him. He is definitely worth keeping an eye on.

Miami criminal lawyer Jack Swytek agrees to represent his friend Theo's brother Tatum Knight. Tatum claims Sally Fenning tried to hire him to kill herself. He refused but she was killed anyway. He now finds himself among the six beneficiaries of her forty six million dollar estate. There is a catch, however. Only one person will inherit the estate after all the others have died or renounce their claim. This will obviously lead to violence. Perhaps it is Sally's way to get back at those who made her life a nightmare after the murder of her daughter. It doesn't take long for the dying to start.This is the second legal thriller I have read by James Grippando and would now call myself a fan. The book is fun, well paced and at least the main characters sketched with great care. One gets a strong sense of the South Florida environs without all the preaching exhibited by some other authors from the state.

FBI special agent Kelda James is considered by many a hero after rescuing a kidnapped girl. She has now volunteered to pick up and deliver from prison a man who was condemned to death and not only taken off death row but freed after information obtained by Kelda that appears to exonerate him. The man, Tom Clone, has served seven years for a crime he apparently didn't commit. He needs counciling and Kelda refers him to her own analyst, Psychologist Alan Gregory. Alan soon determines that the connection between Kelda and tom is much more than it seems. All becomes divulges through several twists of the very compelling plot.Stephen White is a much heralded thriller writer. His main protagonist is Alan Gregory, a psychologist like himself. What is most impressive about this writer is his ability to delve into characters without sacrificing the plot or pacing. He actually reminds me of Lawrence Block with his Scutter books. White is that good. The plot is clever. It is well paced and the surprises in store appear to be well thought out. Highly recommended.

Dan Fesperman has written two superb novels concerning war torn Yugoslavia from two different perspectives of time. They were, in essence, detective novels. Yet, they revealed a writer with enormous gifts-one who could create astoundingly realistic and sympathetic characters and place them in a setting few in the western hemisphere have ventured during wartime. They depict an unforgettable hell where residents cower in fear and just traveling to the market could end a life by a stray bullet from a distant sniper. Dan Fesperman has not been ignored, however. The Crime Writers Association of Great Britain have honored both books. LIE IN THE DARK won the Creasey Award for best first crime novel and THE SMALL BOAT OF GREAT SORROWS won the Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller. Now he returns in by far and away his best work to date. In a sense it is sweeping in grandeur like DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, yet intimate enough to be reminiscent of a Graham Greene and as a thriller intelligent enough to be in the same ranks of John LeCarre. However, I predict Dan Fesperman will ultimately equal them in fame writing his own type of stylistic war novels. This one is a masterpiece.American journalist, Stanford J. Kelly AKA Skelly, is ready to try one more time to bring home the big story. He has covered all the major hotspots of the last twenty years and now, just after 9/11, he travels to Pakistan in an effort to enter Afghanistan with an exiled warlord trying to reclaim power. In order to succeed, however, he needs a "fixer" or translator not only of the language but of the culture, the people and the landscape. The individual he hires is Najeeb, educated at an American University but due to a betrayal is a pariah to his family. Najeeb wants only to emigrate to the US with Daliya, his girlfriend, but the door appears to be shutting tight. In spite of these personal problems, Najeeb wants to do a good job for Skelly but protecting him gets more and more difficult the deeper he ventures into the wilds of Afghanistan.To understand the complex cultures of this untamed part of the world, a reader would be hard pressed to find a book that so immerses the reader fully into this repressed society. It is a scary place- both unyielding and difficult for a westerner to comprehend. It is easy to see why Bin Laden has not yet been found. It should be required reading for students of modern American History and for anyone who wants to appear informed about culture in this untamed part of the world. All of Dan Fesperman's talents of realistic characters, forbidding landscapes and portrayals of distant wars are in full evidence here. Once a reader is brought into the hot dusty realm of the story of these brave souls, it will be hard to let go. Easily the best novel of the year thus far.

Within a polar ice cap lies a secret. The Russians are so worried that the secret will get out that they are willing to kill to keep it quiet. The US Navy Seals are called in to wage war and a nuclear sub is brought in for backup. Throw in a few Alaska residents who inadvertently stumble into the mess, their dog, and a few prehistoric monsters and perhaps you will have the start of a thriller. At stake, the possibility of a nuclear blast annihilating the polar ice cap affecting weather patterns all over the world and life as we know it.What a mess! ICE HUNT is full of interminable chases- the Russians chase the American military and the Alaskan residents. The US military chasing the Russians, the prehistoric monsters chasing whatever it sees and all within the claustrophobic confines of the polar ice cap station. In fact, the author is well aware how complex this station is- he includes a detailed map of the station. This is a prime example of a book going about 150 pages longer than it should have.

The advertising for this debut is a bit misleading. First of all, the name of Janet Evanovich is evoked on one of the testimonials alluding to the humor and the female protagonist with the name of Jack Daniels. The author uses two initials instead of a proper first name creating an aura that this represents a possible chick lit comic novel. However, the edgy nature of the work and the profound violence leave little doubt that a male heart beats at the core of this clever but dark work.A serial killer is loose in the city of Chicago. 46 year old Lieutenant Jacqueline Daniels aka Jack Daniels, a member of the Violent Crimes Unit has the case. Women are being murdered and their bodies violated and mutilated. The killer decides to play a game with Jack which considerably raises the stakes for her personally. She must catch the killer or be a victim with no room for any other outcome.Another serial killer novel. There are so many out there that an author must do something to distinguish their novel from the rest. What J.A. Konrath has done is create a heroine with a unique voice. She looks upon life a bit more in a lighthearted vein in spite of the horrors around her. There are some humorous lines that are funny without being too cute. Other than that, this has all been done before ad nauseum ie. The serial killer playing a game of life and death with the main protagonist as the body count progressively rises throughout. I appreciate the fact that the book didn't end with the stock device of the villian holding the hero at gunpoint while divulging all. Overall a clever character with a unique voice makes for a worthwhile read.

Roy Slater, an English Professor teaching in a small California college, comes to Kingdom County, West Virginia to care for his dying father. He hasn't been back in twenty five years. The reason he left is not immediately apparent but it has something to do with the death of his brother and some local murders. He also left behind the love of his life, Lila who remains unmarried. Why did he leave? What ended his relationship with Lila? How and why did his brother die? What about these murders? Slowly and inexorably bits and pieces of these puzzles are revealed as the reader is strung along on a suspense high wire.Tom Cook is back in what is probably his best book since the astounding BREAKHEART HILL and the Edgar Award winning THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR. Once again he uses the technique of having the narrator hold the answers and only slowly letting the reader in on the secret. However, INTO THE WEB goes further than that. Roy Slater only knows some of the answers. He must find out others on his own. Therefore the novel evolves into an amateur detective novel about two thirds of the way through. Surprises await at every twist and turn. Nobody in the genre creates more tension in this manner. Characters are, as usual skillfully created and depiction of locale quite vivid. Thomas H. Cook is one of the finest writers of suspense fiction currently working. I urge you to read him today and INTO THE WEB would be an excellent place to start.

When Catherine Ducane, daughter of the governor of Louisiana, is kidnapped, a ransom note is sent demanding a meeting with Ray Hartmann, an organized crime investigator. Ernesto Perez, the presumed kidnapper, claims to have Catherine hidden somewhere and will be released after he has had several meetings with Hartmann. They meet at The Royal Sonesta in New Orleans under the watchful guardianship of the FBI. Perez then uses Hartmann to tell his life story. On the surface, it appears to be a man simply unloading details of an evil life. We are taken back to his boyhood and numerous episodes that made him into a Mafia hit man. Hartmann, listens but is desperate to get back to NYC where he is to meet his ex-wife and daughter and hopefully repair their relationship. The story that is told leads the reader on a picaresque journey from New Orleans to Cuba to New York and many other locations giving, in a sense, a history of organized crime in the USA.Told in alternate chapter form- Perez's story and Hartmann's reaction to it,- Roger Ellory paints a vivid picture of the life of a criminal. This is a long book that reads like a much shorter work filled with realistic characters. Of course, Perez is a sympathetic figure given the fact that it is he telling the tale. Pacing is fast because of the alternate chapter format between the Perez life story and the modern day investigation. A surprise ending rewards the reader. A QUIET VENDETTA is an excellent example of how superb a writer Roger Ellory is. It is the book to beat in the next year and, in my opinion, the best book written by him. This begs the question- why isn't he a major bestselling author in this country like he is in England?

Kate Gallagher is piloting a commercial jet into Kennedy airport on her way home to her five year old daughter. Trouble from both a blizzard and mechanical problems put her in a precarious position with a choice to either land the plane at Kennedy or fly elsewhere. Unfortunately, her choice to land the plane proves disastrous. Kate is blamed, yet, she knows it wasn't her fault. In an effort to clear her name, she looks into why the plane failed. The result, we soon find out, is due to a computer virus that incapacitates a pilots ability to control the plane. Under threats to herself, her friends and her family, Kate undertakes a quest to find out the reason behind the virus and to prevent further events from occurring.Kam Majd has written a taut suspense thriller. The concept of a virus in the computer of a plane is original. However, the strength of the book is the authentic feel of the aviation descriptions. Mr. Majd is a pilot and is able to interject much realism into the passages involving the workings of the commercial jet. As a thriller, the book works well with a tightly woven plot and is remarkably well paced for a first time novel. It is, however, simply not extraordinary enough for the Edgar recognition it received. I am curious to read the next book by Kam Majd. Once again, it features pilot Kate Gallagher. I want to see the rationale for a pilot to repeatedly solve crimes.

In the winter of 1537, lawyer Matthew Shardlake is asked to look into the brutal murder of a commissioner of Thomas Cromwell, the vicar general of King Henry VIII at a monastery on the south coast of Britain. The much feared Cromwell demands that Shardlake get results immediately so Cromwell will have everything wrapped up when he tells the king about the incident. He sends Shardlake as his representative to solve the crime. This is in the midst of the dissolutions of the Catholic monasteries throughout the realm as presided over by Cromwell. Shardlake, a hunchback travels the treacherous roads with his aide, Mark Poer, from London to the remote monastery. The suspects include many of the monks residing there. Things get especially tense as the deaths continue even after Shardlake arrives.There is a wealth of detail in this well written debut which, alone, makes this work noteworthy. Sansom succeeds in bringing this time and place of almost five hundred years ago to the reader with a rare sense of immediacy. In fact, it is the fascinating detail that keeps the pages turning. The mystery itself is cleverly presented and the solution quite adequate. Pacing is the casualty of the meticulous attention to detail. Characters appear realistic, yet, it is difficult to distinguish one monk from another. A glossary in the front helps. Historical mysteries can be extremely difficult to write especially by a first time novelist who handles the task adeptly. A worthy nominee in two Crime Writers Association categories.

Viktor Strandgard, a preacher of a church in northern Sweden called The Source of All Strength, is found in the chapel viciously slaughtered. His sister Sanna discovers the body and is emotionally at a breaking point. She contacts her friend Rebecka Martinson, a tax attorney in Stockholm, for her help. When Sanna is arrested for the murder, Rebecka seeks a solution to the crime in order to free her friend. Naturally, the killer does not want to be discovered and the closer Rebecka gets to the solution, the more danger she places herself in.SUN STORM is a solid amateur detective novel that is very strong on characterization. Rebecka must cope with many personal issues including dealing with Sanna's daughter as well as her own job which is threatened by her involvement in this case. Rebecka is a sympathetic character and a strong heroine. The plot is carefully laid out and the author plays fair with the reader who wants to solve the crime along with Rebecka. The setting is well described as the Aurora Borealis (the sun storm) flickers above the frigid landscape of the small town. The plot could have moved a bit quicker for my taste, but that is a minor criticism and shouldn't bother most readers. SUN STORM won Sweden's best first crime novel award when it was first published in Sweden in 2003.

Ethan Decker, an agent for a secretive government agency is expecting to be killed after retiring from the agency. He is, therefore, surprised when a fellow agent shows up with two children for his safe keeping. The children were taken off a secret island where they were involved in some kind of experiment. When the agent is killed, it is left up to Ethan Decker to find out where the children are from and why they were being held on the island.BLIND RUN is an entertaining debut novel that is remarkably ordinary and forgettable. The characters never quite manage to be sympathetic whole creations. Stereotypes abound. The pacing is quite fast as a thriller should be and the length supports the pedestrian plot. A good job for a debut novel but it failed to draw my attention to the author enough to buy and read her next book.

It is the intention of C.C. Humphreys to write more of an adventure novel filled with &quot;swashbuckling and derring-do&quot; rather than a true historical novel. There is, nonetheless, much research that went into this epic work. However, the sheer size of the book weighs down the excessively lengthy plot.In 1536, Anne Boleyn, wife of Henry VIII, is to be beheaded. The King brings over from France a renowned executioner to do the job properly. Jean Rombard is the executioner. Anne, just prior to the execution asks one favor of Jean-- that her hand (the one with six fingers) is buried at a sacred crossroad in France. Jean agrees but an eyewitness, Archbishop Giancarlo Ciba, sees him cut off the hand and arranges that Jean be robbed and left for dead. Jean, remembering his oath to Anne, is determined to get back the hand and bury it at the sacred location. The rest of the book concerns his quest to fulfill that promise.C.C. Humphreys admirably attempts to write a novel reminiscent of THE THREE MUSKETEERS. However, in spite of his attempt to concentrate more on the entertaining side of the story, he seems to get bogged down in the historical detail. There are many parts of the book that will remain with the reader long after the book is closed-- such as the humanity and tragedy of Anne Boleyn's execution or the scenes aboard a warship in which the main characters are slaves relegated to rowing. The plot is multifaceted and quite complex. Yet, the story does not move smoothly enough through the many pages. The end result is a book that is overall difficult to read yet filled with impressively written episodes. It is, nonetheless, an original work.

Several stories of varied characters converge in a literally explosive climax in this extraordinarily well written novel. On the Mexican US border outside of Tucson, lives Mackie Larkin, a divorced housewife who dreams of owning a dance studio but after a failed real estate deal, desperately needs money just to make ends meet. Her daughter, Lianne falls for an older man who works at the same ranch her father does. Nicholas Loeb is a mystery writer who travels to rural Arizona to get hands on experience in law enforcement. Buck Samsonov is a crime lord who runs a couple of strip joints in the region. All their paths converge in this very clever crime novel. The question is who will be on top in the end.After a slow start the plot becomes increasingly fast paced once we get to know each of the characters and their separate problems. Alternate chapters are used initially to reveal the individual characters. Part of the change in momentum occurs when the characters' lives converge making the separation by chapter no longer necessary. The characters, a major strength of the work, are all original creations. The conclusion is a bit problematic and unrealistic. However, this one is well written and very much worthy of a reader's time.

International thrillers can be one of the most entertaining of fiction writing. They are typically found in airports and poolsides all over the world. They can also make the authors, who write them well, extremely wealthy as the books are parked on the bestseller lists for weeks at a time. Their names such as Robert Ludlum, Nelson Demille, Ken Follet, Trevanian, Tom Clancey and, of course, Ian Fleming are household words. In an effort to enter into this august body of writers enters Brad Thor with his debut novel and it is a good one.THE LIONS OF LUCERNE introduces the reader to Scot Harvath, ex-Navy SEAL and currently a Secret Service agent in charge of protecting the President and his daughter on their ski vacation in Utah. A dramatic kidnapping of the President occurs by terrorists culminating in a devastating avalanche. Scot is the only agent who survives the attack and, as such, is the scapegoat in the apparent lapse of security. Discharged from his duties, Scot takes it upon himself to locate and rescue the President. What ensues is a cat and mouse game between, not only Scot and the terrorists, but between Scot and the FBI and CIA. As with any good international thriller, locales change between the ski slopes of Utah to the nation's capital and the gorgeous scenery of Switzerland.In writing an international thriller, the primary objective of the author should be to simply entertain the reader. If an important issue such as arms control or oil exportation can be interjected into the plot, all the better. It would be wonderful if the characters can be truly lifelike, however, the books are plot driven rather than character driven giving the author much latitude. Brad Thor understands all of this and, as such, has given us a wonderfully entertaining book that in sheer entertainment, makes up for the lack of realism. It would be frivolous to judge the book on it's comic book characters or the pure banality of the terrorist's objectives in carrying out the kidnapping. The logic that Scot uses to determine the need to seek answers in Switzerland based simply on a piece of chocolate is truly a major stretch as is his discovery of the President's location. The use of the locale is contrived but quite effective.As a debut thriller writer, Brad Thor is quite successful. However, I would expect to see some improvement in his subsequent books. The plots should be a bit more plausible. The evidence driving the investigation should be a bit more logical. The characters could use an injection of realism. He must do all this while maintaining the same high level of octane in the breakneck speed of his plots. We may have a worthy successor to the great Robert Ludlum.

In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9-11, comes a timely thriller that examines biological warfare. Malaria is a disease that has been almost entirely eradicated from the United States. A pharmaceutical company is on the verge of testing and producing a drug that might virtually wipe it out. The problem, however, is that there is little profit for the company in the product in that the potential users are the destitute of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the project is scrapped. Su Thon, an Asian scientist and employee of the company is incensed over the decision as he has witnessed his loved ones succumbing to the disease. He correctly observes that Americans don't care about Malaria and won't do so until they suffer the ravages of the disease themselves. He therefore plans to release an especially deadly strain of the disease through hundreds of mosquitoes in the nation's capital which could cause thousands to die. It is up to Conor Gale, a private investgator and Zee Aspen, a scientist working on developing the drug in the Carribbean to stop Su Thon.V. A. MacAlister has written a clever novel filled with social agendas. She attacks the greed of pharmacological companies, examines the ravages of Malaria and the potential benefits of marine pharmacology. Ms. MacAlister is a diver and her enthusiam is quite evident through the many passages that her characters spend under the ocean. The immediacy of the inherent dangers of biological warfare adds to the tension of this fast paced thriller. THE MOSQUITO WAR is not only solid entertainment but a solid debut, as well.

Perhaps it is not fair for a mystery reviewer to review a horror book. Mysteries should be rooted in reality. Horror novels can resort to ghosts, demons or monsters all of which would be considered fair game. From a mystery reader's standpoint, horror novels would be considered way over the top as is the example of this current work.In London, 1919, an old man is killed after being hit by a carriage. The man, Konstantin Duvall, is well known in the upper echelons of British society. In fact, it is Winston Churchill who tells Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of his death. It seems Duvall was also involved in a highly secret occult group known as The Arcanum. Other members of this group include Doyle, Harry Houdini, Marie Laveau, the voodoo princess and H.P. Lovecraft, the horror writer. The four eventually get together to fight evil forces in New York City as multiple dead bodies are turning up with their spinal cords torn out. In essence they must save the universe from the agents of hell.Many scenes of this overwrought work takes place in dark corridors and subterranean passages filled with red eyed, knife slashing deadly demons. There is, therefore, an overwhelming sense of unreality and, as such, there is a distinct lack a true sense of place and depth of characterization with the quartet appearing more as comic book heroes than living breathing individuals. Pacing is the major strength of this work as the main purpose is to entertain and thrill the reader. As a horror novel and thriller it works quite well. But, as a mystery- no way!

What could possibly generate more anger and sympathy in a reader's mind than a mother and young child being blown apart by a car bomb. This is just what happens to the ex-wife and daughter of John Pavlak, a small college athletic director and ex- military hero. The question is, why? Pavlak will stop at nothing to discover the truth no matter the cost in dollars or loss of life. As we accompany Pavlak on his search for "someone to kill", we enter into the world of the cold war and its spies. Pavlak must also search for answers in his own family's history including his relationship with his physically abusive father.Kurt Corriher is a student of the international thriller sub genre. This is quite evidenced by the fact that his first novel is almost a survey of what makes a thriller successful. First of all is a sympathetic hero with a military background who can be realistically expected to step into the role of savior of the universe. John Pavlak easily fits that part. The loss of his ex-wife and young daughter, not only make him a victim, but generates much anger against the villains by, not only Pavlak, but the reader, as well. Pavlak needs a beautiful love interest and Karin, sister of another victim eventually is just that. The scenery must change and with the book comes a free ticket to such widespread places as Germany to Crete. Most important of all, the plot must be plausible, have a certain level of complexity and move like the wind. All of this is successfully accomplished. A problem with this book, albeit a minor one, is the length. Thrillers can be quite lengthy. However, this particular book is a bit too long as the book appears to run out of steam into a somewhat disappointing solution and predictable conclusion. However, there is much promise in this book and it is one that is strongly recommended.

Mrs. Risk is considered a witch. I am not sure why. What she is an amateur detective who, with her sidekick, Rachel, our recently widowed narrator, investigates murder and theft in a small village on Eastern Long Island. Mrs. Risk is well known from short stories in the Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine and mystery anthologies. This is her first foray into the realm of the novel form.The case involves a famous comedian from the Catskills by the name of Pearl Schrafft. Pearl was given a famously expensive necklace by her late husband. It was nicknamed "The Borscht Pearl". At a party in which Mrs. Risk and Rachel are in attendance, the necklace is stolen. The culprit is felt to be Pearl's long lost sister, Bella, who is back from Paris and engaged to Pearl's manager, Solly. When Solly is poisoned at a dinner, all eyes look toward Bella, as well as, Pearl, as the culprits. It is up to Mrs. Risk to solve the crime.THE WITCH AND THE BORSCHT PEARL is a traditional mystery with an ethnic flair. The strength of the work lies in the superior characterizations-especially that of the indomitable Mrs. Risk and her sidekick, Rachel. The supporting cast are a wacky bunch and some are quite stereotypic. Dialogue is realistic and well done for a first novel. The first chapter introducing Mrs. Risk and Rachel could be contained as a highly skilled and effective short story. The problem arises when the story is stretched to novel length. Pacing and plot progression is quite problematic. The plot sometimes went off into aimless forays thereby slowing the pacing down excessively, at times. Personally, I wanted Pearl to take the troop to the Catskill Mountains, which is where the title almost promises us to go. However, we didn't go there until near the conclusion of the book. Once there, the action accelerates progressively to the satisfying conclusion. Overall, THE WITCH AND THE BORSCHT PEARL is an enjoyable cozy with an engaging amateur sleuth. With an eye on tightening the plot and accelerating the pacing, I would look forward to future works by Angela Zeman.

Two interrelated tales come together in a harrowing first novel by William Broderick. In Suffolk, England, a man, Eduard Schwermann, asks for sanctuary in a church as he is being sought as a war criminal. Father Anselm is soon asked to look into the matter by the upper echelon of the Catholic church in Rome. He must find a man who worked with Schwermann as a collaborator in France during the occupation of W.W.II. In the meantime, Agnes Aubert is dying of a motor neuron disease and writes her memoirs desperately trying to tell her horrible tale of betrayal and death during the war. It just so happens that Schwermann was the German officer responsible for rounding up Agnes' group whose function was to set up a means of freedom for Jewish children. The two tales eventually converge.Careful characterizations and a humane treatment of a difficult subject make this novel a cut above the ordinary. However, the plot went on a bit too long while the conclusion was so complex that it becomes very difficult to follow.

Bobby Newman, a Hollywood screenwriter with marital, personal and professional problems witnesses a murder from his back porch while spying on his neighbors with a telescope. Looking for a fresh idea for a script, he decides to go to the murdered man's house and investigate rather than call the cops. He finds a hidden video camera that recorded the murder, as well as, a black book that the man used to rate his lovers- including Newman's wife! Newman befriends the investigating detective, Dennis Farentino, in order to follow the investigation. However, things quickly begin to go awry as Newman begins a relationship with the murderer and tries to get back at his estranged wife by implicating her in the murder.Steven Bochco, well known for creating several hit TV series, has written his first novel. He has won Emmys and Edgars for his screenplays but never has written a fictional narrative. It actually and unsurprisingly reads like a screenplay with a relatively brief length to match. This satire reads quite quickly. In a sense, Bochco has used this platform to expand on his views and, at times, condemnation of the Hollywood industry. We learn where the stars eat lunch, what goes through their minds and we get a general view of the shallowness of the society. Thoroughly entertaining and just the perfect length to sustain interest, DEATH BY HOLLYWOOD is an excellent debut novel by a veteran writer who truly writes about what he knows.

Tom Holder, Police Chief of a small town in New Jersey, has several problems. First, a woman is missing and feared harmed--possibly dead. Her husband is discovered drunk and depressed refusing to discuss the disappearance with the police. Second, Tom is stuck in a dead marriage and harbors feelings of affection for a local Episcopal priest, Rev. Kathryn Koerney who feels much the same as Tom. Yet, proper behavior requires they keep their feelings secret from each other. Nonetheless, Tom elicits Kathryn's help in trying to discover why the woman is missing and whom, if anyone, is responsible.CROOKED HEART is a clever traditional mystery with engaging characters and an idyllic locale. The mystery, itself, is very well thought out and, in the end, quite well done. However, the story never truly captured my full interest and, in the end, proves to be quite forgettable. The bottom line: a good read.

Mick Sever, a rock journalist and best selling author, is invited by a promoter to see the latest hot act-- a reggae/rap band led by an angry young man named Derrick Lyman. The band impresses Sever, however, there appears to be a problem. At two previous concerts, young women who attended the concert were later found murdered. The band travels to Miami where they will open the Brandy concert and, hopefully, get a lucrative recording contract.Unfortunately, at a party on a boat, a young woman is not only found stabbed to death but one of the band's security guards is found holding the knife. When the guard is arrested, Sever feels the wrong man was arrested. He tries to prove that he is correct.Amateur PI books can be a bit problematic. To be successful, they must be believable. Just as important, the characters have to be engaging enough to allow the reader to accept the necessary suspension of reality and overlook the fact that, say, a rock promoter as a PI is highly unlikely. Don Bruns succeeds in his first effort. Not only is Mick Sever a believable character, but, being a rock promoter allows him to reveal many interesting facets of the recording industry. Of course, Don Bruns, the author, can supply us with much of the information given that he is a songwriter, musician and ad executive. Mr. Bruns has done his homework well in creating this very, very good mystery by working well within the formulaic genre. He breaks no new ground. The novel is paced well and is kept to a reasonable length. Problems include weaknesses in the more minor characterizations. I never truly got a good feel for many of the suspects. However, Don Bruns deserves a lot of credit for hitting a homer his first time at bat.

Nelson Ingram is a reporter for a local paper in the sleepy southern town of Litchfield, Alabama. Nobody takes much notice when a young black man is lynched and found dead one night. A bullet wound is found in the back of the victim's head. Ingram looks into the case and discovers several recent murders in the surrounding area not typical for this region. Of course, the danger escalates as the truth becomes unraveled.Stephen J. Clark is a fine writer capable of such atmospheric writing as:&quot;Litchfield still appeared to be the epitome of the sleepy southern town. The white-pillared Courthouse stood like a diminutive Roman temple at the head of the square. Across the square sat the squat, workmanlike Town Hall . In the center of the square stood the inevitable memorial for those lost in The War for Southern Independance-- in Litchfield's case a marble statue of a confederate foot soldier, his uniform tattered, but his undercarriage unvanquished, his gaze fixed on the horizon, aloof and proud.&quot;Impressive is his ability to evoke the region and people it with remarkably deep and realistic portrayals. The story is well paced and the length just right for the tightly constructed plot. A weakness is the stereotypic depictions of the mob villains we eventually encounter, as well as, the inevitably predictable conclusion. Yet, this remains a powerful work and an admirable debut.

I have been avidly following the writing career of Harlan Coben since the early days of the Myron Bolitar paperback originals in the early to mid 90s. It is interesting to note the progression of this writer's developing talent. The early books were relatively lighthearted and, at times, downright hysterical romps around the northern New Jersey and Manhatten area. They were quite evidently reflections of the author's milieu where he grew up. They are filled with much Jewish angst and, overall, they create a very human portrait of Myron Bolitar. As the books progress, they become much darker with deeper meaning . In fact, from lighthearted humor tragedy rears its ugly head. Now, Harlan has left Myron to write stand-alone thrillers that pierce the human psyche. He also is being well compensated for these new books which I hereby entitle "The return of the dead?" in that both TELL NO ONE, as well as, our current consideration, GONE FOR GOOD, have as their central focus a character believed to be dead yet true doubts exist.Will Klein is told by his mother, on her deathbed, that his brother, Ken, is still alive. Ken disappeared years before after he was accused of raping and murdering a neighbor's daughter. It was assumed that Ken had to be dead in that he would never have had the resources to remain alive. Will currently works for Covenant House in Manhatten with his close friend, Squares, a reformed white supremist. They help abused and runaway children. Unfortunately for Will, soon after his mother's death, his girlfriend, Sheila, the love of his life mysteriously leaves him. He pursues her and looks into his brother's disappearance. He begins to find answers to difficult questions. The answers might very well prove there is much he needs to know about Sheila and Ken. With the new knowledge comes danger.As a long-time reader of Harlan Coben, it is gratifying to see some brief episodes of humor in the Bolitar vein. Squares very much reminds this reader of a much more human Win, Bolitar's partner and sidekick. Yet there are long passages that exude the true power and beauty of Harlan's writing. The type of writing that forces the eyes backward to fully experience those words again. I almost never quote but this is just one striking example:"Morty played in Las Vegas, Las Vegas-the real Las Vegas, the city itself, no strip-strolling tourist trade in psuedo-suede and sneakers, no whistling and hollering or squeals of joy, no faux Statue of Liberty or Eiffel Tower, no Cirque de Soleil, no roller coasters, no 3-D movie rides or gladiator costumes or dancing water fountains or bogus volcanoes or kid appeal arcades. This was downtown Las Vegas. This was where grimy men with barely a mouth of teeth per table, the dust of their pickups still coming off them with each shoulder slump, lost their meager paychecks. The players here were bleary-eyed, exhausted, their faces lined, their hard times baked on by the sun."Without the constraint of a series, Harlan can feel free enough to take his stories' characters wherever he wants them to go. They explore the very dark faces of society and do so in the confines of a truly gripping thriller where things are never as they seem until the very last page. Harlan Coben today-bestselling author, Edgar winner, writer of rare talent and one of the best storytellers on the planet.

Good spy are tough to write especially with the decline of the cold war. The novels that dealt with the cold war have been done many times before by such writers as John LeCarre (writing a more literary book) and Len Deighton (writing in the thriller subgenre). Really good ones are tough to find. Therefore, it is almost astonishing to read a breathtakingly accomplished spy novel by a debut author- both insightful and realistic.The time is 1989 and the Berlin Wall is about to come tumbling down. Gorbachev fully understands the Communist system has ruined the Soviet Union economically and change is on the immediate horizon. However, not all find the horizon rosy and want to turn back the clocks and seize power. To help accomplish this task the Stasi recruits smuggler Faith Whitney to deliver a package to be used for some unknown purpose. Her payment will be revealing the location of her father she long thought dead. If she fails she will die. Faith wonders just what the package contains. The contents she soon learns could change the course of world events.Raelynn Hillhouse is a former smuggler, money launderer and rum runner who smuggled contraband through the Berlin Wall. So she knows of what she writes. There is no doubt that this experience gives the book its vital realism. This is, of course, the major strength of the work. This is a long book- actually way too long with a plot that tends to drag at a snail's pace way too frequently. Characters are a bit too wooden and the plot more complex than necessary. There are moments, however, that are as terrifying and exciting as anything in the thriller subgenre (such as an episode on an airline). It is the promise of these episodes and these moments that keep the pages turning. Make no mistake about it, Raelynn Hillhouse is potentially a very bright star in spy fiction. She just needs to tighten things up a bit. Strongly recommended.

Alex McKnight has returned to Paradise-Michigan, that is. In his fourth outing, summer has finally set in. It is July and the increasingly reclusive Alex is asked to attend a poker game with his good friend, Jackie, owner of the local bar that Alex frequents. Unfortunately, the poker game at the house of a wealthy local businessman, Winston Vargas, is interrupted by an armed robbery in which everyone is forced to the floor at gunpoint. Vargas, alone, is robbed as he is forced to open his safe. The aftermath is quite perplexing as half the men attending the game are arrested for the robbery. Alex is convinced they are innocent and does what he can to clear their names. However, things get increasingly violent as Alex gets closer to the truth.Steve Hamilton, Edgar winner for best first novel A COLD DAY IN PARADISE has written one of his best novels yet. I am always impressed with his ability to give the locale a certain immediacy to the reader. The first two books in the series took place primarily in the winter cold. Now we get a feeling of this Upper Michigan location in the midst of the summer season. Life is very different as boating and fishing become the primary pastime of the residents and visitors. We are treated to in depth descriptions of this area frequented by tourists. Alex is a loner, yet, he proves in this book that he is a loyal friend who will stop at nothing to defend those he is closest to. His character gives this series the true sense of realism and makes every return visit a pleasure. Pacing is never a problem with Steve Hamilton and this novel is no exception as the book proves to be a very fast and fully enjoyable read. With his talent, Steve Hamilton deserves a much wider audience.

It is the 1920s and the Scientific American Magazine is offering a $5,000 reward for anyone who could prove themselves to be a real spiritualist. Many apply and only the most promising are investigated by the committee. One of the members of the committee is a promising graduate student, Martin Finch. His ingenuity has proved several of the most brilliant and famous spiritualists as frauds. He now is off to Philadelphia with the committee to evaluate the 'society psychic' Mina Crawley. Mina presents a unique problem to Martin. First, her seances appear authentic and quite difficult to prove as fake. The second and more important problem is that Martin is falling in love with her in spite of the fact that she is married.INAMORATA is not a true mystery in the usual definition of the genre. No murders occur but the mystery lies in finding the proof that Mina is a fraud. The book is clever and quite a bit of fun. The historical era is very well depicted in this atmospheric novel filled with realistic characters. The length is perfect for the plot and the solution is both clever and satisfying. A recommended read.

Robert Ludlum was one of my favorite writers of the international thriller. His recent death has left a void in the subgenre. However, the void has quickly and expeditiously been filled in by his heir apparent and hand picked successor, Gayle Lynds. Gayle was highly praised by Robert Ludlum with her first few thrillers and actually started a series with him called the Covert One novels- all bestsellers. His style of pulse stopping action alternating with increasingly complex expository passages about some global threat is what Gayle uses in this, her latest and most ambitious novel to date.Liz Sansborough, former CIA agent is teaching at The University of California in Santa Barbara while writing and hosting a highly popular television show called 'Secrets of the Cold War'. However, her whole world is thrown into sudden disarray when an attempt is made on her life. At the same time, her cousin Sarah is kidnapped in Paris after her husband is shot. The ransom the kidnappers demand are the files of Liz's late father, an assassin during the cold war. The burning question is why are the files so valuable and to whom. With her life on the line, Liz teams with MI6 agent Simon Childs to get answers.As with the best thriller novels, there must be someting at stake that could affect a large number of people with a topical interest of the day. In the past, the Cold War was an excellent starting point. In the nineties, terrorists became the common villian. Gayle Lynds, however, has chosen a more unique path. She examines a secret society with members from the most powerful organizations on the planet. In this case, The Coil is the supersecret group that threatens the life of our heroine and her companions. There is no denying the authentic feel of the action sequences (some of the best written in recent years). However, the book is so very long and the story so complex that one wonders if perhaps the plot could have been a bit tighter. Nonetheless, the reader is in for one heck of a ride. Another winner from one of my favorite writers.

Vince Flynn, in my mind, is one of the top two or three thriller writers working today. His novels, always topical, can be considered almost nightmarish but highly plausible scenarios of political disasters. Mitch Rapp, CIA assassin, is a thriller hero whose character has evolved over the last few books. He is married but his real marriage is to his work rather than the woman he loves. His willingness to stand alone in his highly aggressive stance in questioning his Muslim suspects in order to save possibly hundreds of thousands of lives places him in an adversarial position with the politically motivated top aides of the President. He is even at odds with the President himself. This loner attitude that gets results makes him an ideal thriller hero.Nuclear bombs are being deployed to the United States covertly by terrorists. Mitch Rapp , through an aggressive inquisition, discovers where the bombs are heading and must intercept them before they are deployed. His biggest obstacles to achieving his objective is the political machine of Washington and actually calls into question the US Citizen's civil rights. When should an individual's rights be subjugated to the greater good of society? Of course, the greater question is -will Rapp meet his objective of stopping the explosions.It is the utter realism of these events which could very well be tomorrow's headline that makes this superior thriller stand out among the rest. MEMORIAL DAY is a fun book with a rollicking plot that never really lets up. It also brings into focus some of the political shenanigans that Washington is known for and in this election year makes this book all the more relevant and frightening. An ideal summer read especially the summer of 2004.

On the Cornish coast in Great Britain, retired DI Frank Elder is faced with several problems. On a personal level his marriage has fallen apart and he is trying to foster his relationship with his sixteen year old daughter. On a professional level Shane Donald has just been released from prison and escaped from a half way house. Fourteen years ago, Shane Donald and Alan McKiernan were arrested for the brutal rape and slaying of a young girl. Now another young girl has disappeared and all fingers appear to be pointing to Shane. Elder was responsible for the original arrests and is now hired as a consultant in the case given that he knows Shane. However, as Elder investigates, things get way too close to home.John Harvey has written a superb character rich crime novel in the same vein as Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson or Reginald Hill. Specifically I am referring to the leisurely paced novel that truly centers on the police officer almost to the subjugation of the plot. When done right there are few works that compare in terms of richness of language, character and the locale itself. This is a very impressive work and it is the subtle tension of the missing women and the subsequent murders that truly keep the pages turning. My one gripe is the truly disappointing ending which any reader of the genre would have picked out near the beginning of the book. I felt it was both a cheap and a manipulative device. However, this is one of the best books of the year,overall and a worthy winner of the CWA Silver dagger.

The jackdaw is a bird and, in this case, the code name of a group of six female British spies in WWII. They are assigned the daunting task of infiltrating a French chateau that serves as the communications center of the Nazis. Their mission is to destroy the communications of the Nazi northern European theatre on the eve of the D Day invasion thereby wreaking havoc in the Nazi defensive coordinations. Flick Clairet is the leader of this intrepid bunch and must deal with, not only the risk of the mission, but also the cattiness of her team. On the opposite side is Dieter Franck, a Nazi intelligence officer assigned by Rommel to thwart the efforts of the French resistance. He manages to stumble upon the mission of the Jackdaws. Franck is also a highly effective, yet ruthless, interrogator and with a team of sadistic Gestapo agents, obtains his information about the group. It quickly becomes a cat and mouse game to see if the British agents succeed.Ken Follet has returned, once again, to the arena that made his reputation-- WWII spy intrigue. He has, by doing so, written one of his finest works and may be one of the best WWII spy novels in many years in terms of sheer thrills, rapid fire pacing and truly fun characters. Follett alternates the point of view between Flick and Dieter Franck so we always know what the other side is doing. This technique also serves to develop a sense of sympathy for both sides. Even though we know Dieter represents true evil, we also come to understand that ultimately he has a job to do and must do it at all costs even if he must make a pact with the devil. In spite of the horrors around him, he is a man with moral principals who justifies his actions by claiming he derives no enjoyment in the torture he must use to obtain his information. Flick is also a character consumed with conflicting emotions. She must also ruthlessly kill and justify her action under the umbrella of a war. The alternating point of view provides, not only this contrast in goals and ideology, but, propels the action faster and faster as Dieter pursues Flick. Ultimately, the pages fly!

Mary Ryan, pastry chef at the trendy American Fare Restaurant in San Francisco, makes a grizzly discovery while alone at the restaurant in the early morning. She steps on a trash bag which contains a body of a fellow worker. The fact that she has made the discovery places her at the center of the investigation. Leading the investigation is O'Connor, the former partner of Mary's ex-husband. He gives her the inside track on the progression of the investigation. As much as O'Connor entreats Mary to stay out of police matters, Mary always seems to find trouble--including a couple more dead bodies.I liked this formulaic amateur PI debut novel. The characters are engaging, the setting of San Francisco well utilized and the author's occupation as a pastry chef of interest. Ms. Johnson also manages to keep the length just long enough to contain the well paced plot, yet, short enough to be read in one evening. In future books I would like more inside information about the restaurant industry. This is often the only thing that separates these amateur PI novels-- the occupation of the main character. Ms. Johnson should definitely avoid the timeworn device of the villain holding the hero hostage at the end with a gun while divulging all. Otherwise a very admirable first effort.

Detective Alex Cross is asked by his friend, John Sampson, to help look into the case of Sergeant Ellis Cooper, of the US Army who is scheduled to be executed. Cooper was convicted of violently killing three women on the army base. Cooper swears he is innocent and wants them to prove it. As Cross and Sampson look into the case, they discover a possible conspiracy in the US army that might be responsible for the killings. Of course, their lives are in imminent danger as they delve more deeply into the case.James Patterson has a unique way of writing that is undoubtedly responsible for his huge popularity and success. Characters are fully developed and well known to the readers of his Alex Cross series. They do not, however, drive the plot progression. That is driven by the evil villains trying to destroy someone important in Cross's life such as his family or girlfriend. The plots are always over the top and can border on sheer stupidity. However, they are always entertaining. The books are written in extremely short chapters which read like staccato fire from a machine gun. Pages virtually fly by. In fact, the books can be read in one sitting of moderate length-- perfect for a long plane ride. This one is no exception.

James Lee Burke is simply the best writer of the genre in the sense of pure writing. Turn to virtually any page in the book and the most amazing descriptions and metaphors jump out at the reader. It is impossible not to be swept away by the sheer majesty of his language. Nobody evokes the Louisiana bayou like he can. The stories of the hapless hero, Dave Robicheaux, are complex and peopled by the most well mannered evil thugs in the universe.Robicheaux's friend, Father Jimmy Doyle undergoes a severe beating in New Orleans. Robicheaux, a New Iberia detective investigates with the help of the violent but lovable Clete Purcel. Of course this simple act leads to an increasingly complex web of violence consuming the lives of both the good and the very bad.Burke's stories never really change. That is the one problem with the books. Each particular work is outstanding but taken as a whole they appear quite repetitive. Names are unbelievably unique- Junior Crudup, Merchie Flannagan, Castille LeJeune, Sugar Bee Quibodeaux, among many others. After living for eight years in New Orleans, I have never come upon a set of names of the characters that populate a Burke novel. Nonetheless, they are so very realistic that the reader will truly feel they know each and every one before the end. Superb- just not unique to the author.

CIA assassin, Mitch Rapp, has earned his share of enemies over the years. After killing the son of a member of Saudi royalty in a previous volume, the father puts out a high priced hit on Mitch's head. He hires an ex-Stasi agent to do the job. Of course, Rapp is known for being very difficult to kill and only the top killers in the world can even hope to succeed. Meanwhile, Mitch is very happily married with a pregnant wife and is only vaguely aware of the impending danger. In Mitch's line of work, happiness can be fleeting. Make no mistake about it, Vince Flynn is the prototypical thriller writer working today. I have been a faithful reader of his books since TERM LIMITS, his first effort. The books are getting better with each succeeding volume. In fact, I would say the three best working thriller writers are Vince Flynn, Dan Silva and Matthew Reilly. The most important element in a thriller novel besides a solidly created main protagonist, is the propulsion of the plot. If well written, all outside distractions should fade as the pages fly by. This book has it all- riveting action, realistic characters and fun plot. Highly recommended.

There have been many many collections published over the years of the Sherlock Holmes canon. I think it is safe to say that this one surpasses them all. Leslie Klinger is considered one of the foremost Holmes authorities in the world. He not only provides a lucid and thorough introduction to the work but his forward tells the reader what the Victorian world was like at the time the works were published.The stories themselves are treated with the utmost respect. No Bible thin paper quality here. The pages are thick and the type large and easily read. The text is written in column form with copious notes written for the general reader by Leslie Klinger appearing along side the text vs. footnotes at the bottom of the page. These notes provide in depth explanations of references in the text that may not be familiar to the modern reader. To make this volume an extra special treat are the numerous illustrations that are interspersed directly into the text at the location the illustration refers to. These are the original illustrations by Sidney Paget that appeared in the Strand Magazine or Frederick Dorr Steele in Collier's among many others. Vintage photographs appear throughout lending the tales an added level of realism. Mr. Klinger has also written articles to educate the reader such as the Boer War, the guns of Sherlock Holmes, swamp adders and various other topics pertaining to the stories.These two volumes represent all the short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes. In one year, the novels will appear in a separate volume. THE ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES is a superb work and should be the cornerstone of any home mystery library. It is truly a joy to read and marvelous to look at.

Chris Nielson, an unemployed rock musician, is hired by Ted Harper, an old friend of his father, to watch his house in Point Fury on the Maryland coast during the cold winter months. Apparently, there have been past robberies in this community and Ted wants the house to be lived in. Chris feels the solitude may give him a chance to develop his musical skills so accepts the job with some trepidation. As the long winter settles in, Chris notices a mysterious woman has moved into the house next door. Discovering who she is and why she is there proves to be highly dangerous to Chris. Dangerous enough to possibly cost him his life at the hands of a madman.John Maxwell has written a superior psychological suspense thriller. The isolated frigid locale plays very much a part in this tale, which, in a sense, is a cat and mouse game. The nightmare scenario is very well played out by the realistic characterizations. The highly entertaining plot is well paced. POINT FURY IS another excellent read for the summer months. Rating

One of my favorite books written in the last decade is TRUE CRIME by Andrew Klaven. It was also liked by Clint Eastwood who made a film out of it. There was a strong sense of suspense, which grabbed the reader from the first page and never let up. Unfortunately, Mr. Klaven has been unable to recreate that sense of superb storytelling with his subsequent books and they proved to be not nearly as successful. He also left the genre by writing a ghost story. However, I am pleased to report that he is again up to his usual high standards.Cal Bradley, a psychiatrist is happily married in a small New England town. Into his life step two men who threaten to tear his life apart. One is Peter Blue, a young man who, after beating his girlfriend, ran to a local church and set it on fire while threatening a police officer with a gun. Cal sees a lot of potential good in Peter and decides to take him under his wing at a local psychiatric hospital instead of keeping him in prison where Peter threatens suicide. The second is a shadowy tough figure of a man who may have past ties to Cal's wife, Marie. He may be the key to the unraveling of their marriage.Andrew Klaven has written a fast paced suspense novel with just the right amount of surprises to keep the pages flying. Characters are very well sketched as is the locale. In returning to the crime fiction and suspense subgenre, Andrew Klaven has returned to the arena of his greatest success. I sincerely hope he decides to remain here.

The writer, Gale Grayson, has returned to her hometown, Statlers Cross, Georgia after her husband's death. She lives in her grandmother Ella's house with her child, Katie Pru and Nadianna Jesup, a friend who functions as a caregiver of both her own child, as well as, Katie Pru. Visiting Gale is Scotland Yard Detective Daniel Halford, a friend from her time in England when her husband was alive. Life in the small town is disrupted as three men are found shot dead in a car parked on a remote road deep in the forest. One of the victims is a Vietnamese immigrant who was visiting his family. They recently moved to Statlers Cross and didn't win any friends when they painted their house a garish color of blue. The other two victims are local white supremists. Could this be a hate crime? Bigotry rears its ugly head as the townsfolk come to terms with the murders. This is especially evident when a Molotov cocktail is thrown threw the front window of the Vietnamese family.THE MOTHER TONGUE is a very well written and highly competent cozy. However, it is the lives of the main characters and their supporting cast that takes center stage. The murder, at times, remains a mere afterthought through much of this book until Ms. Holbrook suddenly seems to remember that she must provide the reader with a solution and ending to this work. The major strength of this Edgar nominee is the extremely well depicted characterizations. They are very realistic and most quite interesting enough to spend some time with. There is much local flavor interjected through the descriptions of both the food and locale. As we get caught up in the lives of these folks, however, the plot waxes and wanes until it is set on its true course near the end. A potential problem when picking up a book in a series is that the characters can enter the current work with much baggage from previous episodes. This is definitely the case with Gale Grayson. This proves to be a bit problematic and the reader would do well to read the series in order. Ms. Holbrook is a gifted writer and worthy of this her second Edgar nomination. Rating

Sometimes it is the voice of the character that could make or break a book with the reader. This is especially apparent in a character driven mystery. In this case, it is the voice of the Boston Globe reporter Jack Flynn that did not appeal to this reader.Jack Flynn is called away from an important Boston Red Sox game to receive some information in a dark and seedy factory. The information, provided by an FBI agent is that the Mayor's son is involved in the heist of several priceless paintings from the Gardner Museum. Flynn writes the story and a young woman winds up dead in a parking garage. Flynn's fear is that the woman's death is tied to the story he wrote. He decides to investigate while trying to confront and conquer some issues in his past.DEAD LINE is billed as a &quot;sensational thriller&quot;. This simply is not true. It is a well written highly character driven amateur PI story that, in spite of the fine writing, never manages to rise above the merely ordinary. Wise cracking PIs seem to have thankfully gone out of vogue some five years ago when it seemed every other book contained this main character. This lighthearted approach to serious matters can often be used as a means of balance. However, in this case, the wisecracks were unnecessary and served to bring down the quality of the work. Is it humorous or is it serious? There are enough issues in Jack Flynn's life that serious should have ruled the day. The plot, again is quite ordinary and is the type of work that has been done many times before. The mystery of the murder is not compelling enough to turn the pages and the excessive descriptions of the character's personal life (such as a full chapter devoted to a description of his dog) serves only to slow down the plot even further. The bottom line is that DEAD LINE is a well written work that lacks any true originality.

Dan Abatangelo is a drug dealer who smuggles marijuana into the country from Asia. While on a jaunt to Las Vegas, he meets Shel Beaudry, a card dealer in one of the casinos. They run off together, fall in love and live happily ever after until they both get busted for the drug smuggling. Ten years later, Dan is released from prison and searches for Shel who has gotten herself involved in a relationship with a mentally imbalanced man and a criminal organization. Dan must try to rescue her from this complicated living arrangement while trying to keep both of them alive. It proves to be a near impossible task.David Corbet has written an epic novel rich in characterizations. However, I question the need for the sheer size of this volume. It is 370 pages long, yet, reads like a work of much greater length. True, we get to know the main characters very, very well. But nothing happens for many pages as we concentrate on detail after detail in almost every scene. The pacing is, therefore, lethargic. Nonetheless, the writing is strong and sure, as well as, the characters so realistic that these positives outweigh the negatives thereby allowing for a rewarding reading experience.

The time is 1939 . The place is Madrid. A member of the guardia civil is murdered in the streets. Sergeant Carlos Tejada Alonso y Leon is assigned to look into the case. A woman is found at the scene kneeling at the body. It is assumed she is the killer. Her anger and verbal abuse leveled at the Nationalist guards confirming her staunch Republican views appears to seal the case. However, as Tejada looks into the past of the murder victim who was a friend of his, doubts begin to emerge.Rebecca Pawel wonderfully evokes the setting of Spain just after its bloody civil war that put Franco into power. Much research went into this extremely well written debut. In fact, the immediacy of the setting brings to mind the war torn novels of J. Robert Janes. There is much poverty and misery on the streets where a simple bar of chocolate would be almost impossibly expensive to obtain. Tejada is a complex character. He evokes mixed feelings in the reader. In spite of summarily executing a prisoner, he reveals a great deal of depth in his views and aspirations. He honestly believes in the Nationalist cause and his strong convictions that he is right make him a sympathetic figure to the readers. The plot is relatively simplistic and not lengthy. A worthwhile and recommended read.

After a disappearance of almost thirty years, Roy Harper rings the doorbell of his brother, Jason. Roy was MIA during the Vietnam war and has not been seen since. Before Roy could tell Jason what happened, two crazed assassins come to the house threatening the lives of not only Roy and Jason but Jason's wife and child. This sets up a cat and mouse scenario where Jason's family must try to hide while Jason and Roy go on one final mission. The problem for Jason is that he has no idea what they must do.Brendan DuBois writes a very competent thriller. Suspense is created and sustained by alternate POVs. Characters are reasonably well sketched but villains are stereotypic. The problem is the length. The book really could have been cut over 100 pages. The bottom line is a very entertaining thriller and worthy of a reader's attention.

Mim Bracca, member of a famous rock and roll band and damages soul, returns home after alcohol takes over her life. However, as the past in the form of her estranged father shows up on her doorstep she makes no progress in giving up her drinking. On top of that she is being stalked by someone who appears to want more than just money.Greg Rucka departs from his Atticus Kodiak series of thrillers. In this stand alone he explores the character of a woman living on the edge. Both a successful thriller and a compelling murder mystery, A FISTFUL OF RAIN reveals the prodigious writing talent of the author. A problem, however, is that the author cheats on the solution. The murderer comes completely out of left field. However, the book as a whole is a pleasant enough diversion.

Dick Francis is one of my favorite writers of all time. When an author is touted as the next Dick Francis, I will sit up and take notice. Actually, Kit Ehrman's writing does bear some resemblance to the great man and that's saying a lot.A Dick Francis hero always undergoes a sound pummeling by the forces of evil prior to defeating them far down the road. Kit Ehrman understands this and wastes no time in that at the very beginning of the book, Steve Cline, barn manager of the Foxdale Farm stables in Maryland, is kidnapped by several men he discovered stealing horses from the stable. He is beaten and tied into the back of the horse van. He manages to escape and later finds out how lucky he is in that the last man kidnapped was later found dead. Attacks keep occurring which keep Steve in the middle of things with his life threatened. The question is-- who are these men and why are they stealing horses? Steve must find out quickly or he may yet turn up dead.Kit Ehrman has worked at a racetrack and in show barns as a barn manager and vet assistant. He now owns a horse farm in Indiana. The experience he has had around horses is quite in evidence here. He does a very admirable job in conjuring up the work of Dick Francis. The great man's influence runs through the work starting with the title (Francis wrote a book entitled RISK). Kit writes in the same character point of view. The characters are three dimensional and the villains are over the top. Relationships between Steve and his women are well thought out. The sex scenes, however, are a bit too graphic (to point out one difference). A problem with the book is the length. It is definitely too long. Much unnecessary material is included and the length probably could have been cut one third. However, Steve Cline is an engaging enough character and the story doesn't waver too much. Apparently, this is the first of a series. I would ask Kit to look again at the work of Francis. He really didn't write any series. He wrote two successive books which could have been considered part one and part two. He also wrote three highly acclaimed books about PI Sid Halley. However, Dick Francis understood that a barn manager simply is not realistically in a position to solve one crime after another. If Kit keeps the books as stand alones and pays close attention to pacing and plot length, he might very well be a very worthy successor. He sure impressed me!

Two ten year old girls have been convicted of the murder of a baby seven years ago. Soon after their release from the facilities that housed them, another baby has disappeared. The public is unaware of the release of the girls and it is the police that is investigating the case. To solve the crime they must delve into the seven year old murder where the secret to the current kidnapping may reside.I have had a problem in the past with the books of Laura Lippman almost entirely having to do with the pacing of her stories. In the multiaward winning Tess Monaughan series, she delves, in my opinion, way too deeply into the psyche of the characters portrayed. Is it really necessary, in a series, to know every inner thought of just about every major or minor character. To me, this serves to slow down the plot, at times, to a lethargic pace. As Laura describes a character in this, her latest novel and a standalone, " Helen's stories were always full of details like that- what she saw, what she ate, what she wore." So are Laura's. However, I will note that I have the same problem with the novels of Sara Paretsky and Sue Grafton. So Laura is in excellent company. I might be one of the few to perceive this as a problem with the Monaghan series in that mystery fans love her work as is evidenced by her legions of fans. I have not truly enjoyed or appreciated her work- until now.EVERY SECRET THING is a psychological suspense novel in the same vein as the works of Ruth Rendall or Minette Walters. These novels are not known for their pacing. They are novels rich in character. There is an underlying sense of the unknown which heightens the suspense. (In this case, how did the baby die in the past and do the girls have anything to do with the current disappearance.) These are leisurely works that draw out this suspense by delving into every detail of the character's lives- their innermost thoughts and actions. Hence the term- psychological suspense novel. Laura's style, which I find so irritating in her series, works brilliantly in this stand alone. Every minute detail continues to prolong the suspense as the reader compusively turns the pages to the crescendo of the shattering climax. I thought nobody writes a better psychological suspense novel than the Brits. However, Laura Lippman has, with ease, managed to outdo them. Superb and a sure finalist at all the major awards next year.

JJ is an assassin for hire. He kills quickly, cleanly and efficiently. It is very surprising, therefore, when he finds himself the target. Many of his former friends become his enemies as he tries to discover who wants him dead and why.The novel starts off quite impressively. JJ is an interesting character and following him around keeps the pages turning. For the first half of the book, the pacing is brisk as JJ looks for clues where none exist and the body count piles up. Then, after traveling to the US, the author slows everything down and turns the second half into an introspective work as to why JJ does what he does for a living. We, in essence, go from a highly charged thriller to a psychological suspense novel. It almost appears the author couldn't make up his mind. The book is quite a slim volume so there is little time for too much more of a slowdown. A good quick read and a promising debut.

Harry Rane retired from the New Jersey State Troopers after being shot on duty two years ago. He lives on a pension and the memories of his late wife- dead of cancer. A friend, Bobby Fox asks for his help. It seems Bobby was involved in a drug deal. His partner in the deal has skipped town leaving Bobby to pay the bills to a local mobster, Eddie Fallon. Bobby wants Harry to act as an intermediary between himself and Fallon. He needs time to get together the $50,000. Fallon, however, proves difficult to deal with and, eventually, Harry has to resort to violence.Wallace Stroby has managed to write one of the year's best novels to date. It is amazing to think this is a debut author. There is a maturity in the depth of the writing rare with a first-timer. Realistic and sympathetic characters mesh perfectly with the vivid New Jersey shore setting. The characters drive this novel but the plot is far from flimsy and could stand on it's own. So much character driven crime fiction focuses on the mundane with plot elements subjugated. Wallace Stroby manages to keep all the elements of the story in the forefront. Highly recommended.

Julia Spenser-Fleming after only three books is one of the most highly regarded writers of the mystery genre. Her third book, OUT OF THE DEEP I CRY, was nominated for the Edgar Award as best novel. Personally, I found it to be a bit too character driven. Her latest is a more balanced work between vital characterization and riveting plot. The result is the best book she has written and probably one of the best works of the year.Clare Fergusson, an Episcopalian priest working in Miller's Kill, a rural community in upstate New York, is called to take part in a search and rescue. Apparently the daughter of a wealthy landowner has disappeared into the surrounding forest. Initially, she is felt to be lost but as time goes on, foul play becomes suspected. Russ Van Alstyne, police chief, also gets involved in the search. The fear level soon escalates when another young woman is found beaten and left for dead. At the same time, an environmental organization is planning on buying up a substantial portion of land placing many of the local men into unemployment. Could all these events be related?Interestingly, it is the women in this deftly written fast paced novel that get the men into trouble. An attempted rescue turns into a kidnapping when the gal being rescued accuses her would be rescuer of murdering her brother after his accidental death. Another woman leads a man into a violent act by provoking him while repeatedly taking his picture with a camera. Last is the destructive relationship between Clare and the married Russ. The two are in love yet never even touched. Russ is married to a woman who loves him and to see Russ and Clare cavort and flirt is painful to witness. It is not violent tragedy like the other two events but is a personal tragedy.

There is no better suspense thriller than THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. It is the prototypical novel that spawned many imitators with few equals. THE ODESSA FILE was another huge success for Frederick Forsyth. However, in spite of writing other fine books, he has never met with the success of the these two books that are decades old. Perhaps the reason for that is the very style of his writing. There is much historical detail in these books. In fact, the historical details go on for pages and can actually read like a history textbook. Personally I remember using passages from THE ODESSA FILE while writing a report on the holocaust in high school. I properly footnoted the reference but the teacher took me to task explaining that novels should not be used as a source of historical research. This is quite evident in his latest book entitled AVENGER.Cal Dexter is a Vietnam Vet who volunteered as a tunnel rat while stationed in Vietnam. His job was to help clean out the vast networks of tunnels used by the Vietcong. This required a certain personality able to withstand living on the extreme edge with danger literally around every corner. One had to be persistent and extremely cautious to survive. Traits that would be ideal for a tracker of missing persons. Cal later went on to become an attorney in New Jersey who secretly takes on jobs requiring him to track individuals and possibly assassinate them. He is now hired by a Canadian billionaire to locate his son who disappeared in Serbia. First he must locate the body then find the person responsible for his death. This man is a terrorist involved in producing a nuclear bomb. Cal must not only capture this highly guarded man but bring him back alive. One of his unexpected adversaries is the CIA who wants the man free to help them locate Bin Laden.The long historical passages, while mostly quite interesting (including extensive descriptions of the tunnel rats), are mostly superfluous to the story and serve to slow down the extensive plot. Therefore it overall fails as a thriller in that the momentum so crucial to this style of book is stopped dead in its tracks again and again. Characters are fairly well sketched and the locale a bit too well described. A very mild recommendation.

The question is what does he gain by her death?Suspicion soon falls on others including a group of squatters that have moved in on land adjacent to the Lockyer-Fox manor. In this group is a psychopath named Fox Evil who is quite capable of the murder. James looks for his illegitimate and only granddaughter, Captain Nancy Smith. Why? There are many mysteries to be answered in this incredibly complex and confusing mess of a book.Minette Walters has written several uneven books over the last five years. However, last year's ACID ROW was one of her best works since the incredible THE SCULPTRESS. Her current work sets new standards for complex psychodramas that are so complicated it borders on incomprehensibility. There are still moments of genius in the writing with her ability to set atmosphere and create realistic and powerful characters. . However, the plot is so dense the reader might lose all interest or wrack their brain cells trying

Frank Clevenger is a forensic psychiatrist who takes on the case of the &quot;Highway Killer&quot; a serial killer who has left bodies along highways throughout the country. The law enforcement authorities haven's got a clue and ask Dr. Clevenger for assistance. What Clevenger doesn't know is that our killer is a locums psychiatrist who travels the country filling temporary jobs. Eventually they communicate through letters to the New York Times. Can Clevenger get him to stop the killings? To do so would involve getting to the very psyche of the killer in an effort to cure the pathology.PSYCHOPATH is a very well written serial killer novel. Good strong well depicted characters add a certain element of realism. Suspense is maintained throughout the tightly constructed story line. There is much psychoanalysis in that the author is also a forensic psychiatrist which adds to the realism. However, with so many serial killer novels out there, I simply could not escape the feeling that I read this before.

A very powerful narrative voice is what drives this debut novel which just so happens to be one of the best of the year so far. The author, Charlie Huston, is also a screenwriter and as expected the dialogue is dead on.Hank Thompson is a bartender on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His life has been a bit of a disappointment in that he was slated to become a major league baseball player until he broke his leg. His humdrum existence comes to an abrupt end when Russ, a neighbor, leaves his cat with him while he visits his sick father for a few days or a few weeks. That night Hank gets so severely beaten up in a bar by two thugs that he requires surgery to remove a damaged kidney. This is just the beginning as Hank is chased, beaten, tortured for an unknown reason. As friends start to die, Hank realizes he must get to the bottom of the problem as his life depends on it.Hank is a complex character. He is tormented by an accident in the past and, in a sense, continues to punish himself with guilt. He is a sympathetic figure to the reader in that it seems everybody else in the book is evil. Rooting for this underdog drives the rapid pacing as the thrills continue one after the other. It is difficult to put the book down until the highly satisfying conclusion. With the superb characterizations, realistic dialogue and riveting story line, CAUGHT STEALING is one of the most memorable debuts this year.

Ann Whitehead is a movie critic for an entertainment weekly in L.A. She is the caretaker of a mansion and lives in the pool house. The morning after a party given by the owner of the house, Ann finds a body in her bathtub. It is the body of a woman Ann met the night before who had written a script she hoped would be made into a feminist movie. Ann works with LAPD Detective Douglas Lockwood to solve the crime. Their investigation takes us endlessly from one character to another.This is the second mystery novel published by Harcourt that I have read in the last few months. (The other being NIGHT MUSIC by Harrison Gradwell Slater). The books are large attractive products but trying to read them will take a tremendous effort by the reader. In this case, one uninteresting character after another is introduced at a rate that will keep the reader's head spinning. Ann Whitehead is only a mildly sympathetic main protagonist but will grate on the reader's nerves after awhile. The plot gets increasingly confusing and is way too long. First time authors should stop trying to write the Great American Novel the first time out of the starting block. It is probably more than they could handle whether they realize it or not. They should live by the adage KISS- keep it simple stupid. In Helen Knode's case, her husband, James Ellroy, probably served as an example for writing the long pretentious Hollywood novel. This one is well worth skipping.

Mike Sullivan's six year old daughter, Sarah, has disappeared while sledding. He took her sledding against her mother's wishes and now he must deal with the guilt and blame. Five years pass. The most likely suspect is Francis Jonah, a defrocked priest who is dying of cancer. Mike is under strict observation for alcohol abuse after beating Jonah to an inch of his life several years before. If Mike drinks or comes near the priest he will go to jail. With jail Mike would lose the last chance to find out what happened to Sarah. On the anniversary of her disappearance Sarah's pink jacket is found on the hill by Jonah. Mike is increasingly desperate to discover the truth before it is too late.REMEMBERING SARAH is a heartbreaking story of suffering. Mike Sullivan, a highly sympathetic character, is beautifully and skillfully depicted as is the supporting cast of his ex-wife, abusive father and the suspect priest. It is the highly complex emotions that drive this compelling plot. There are adequate twists and turns as we reach the ending which should bring tears to the reader's eyes. A very worthy nominee for the Edgar Award.

Andy Carpenter is an attorney practicing in Paterson, New Jersey. He is assigned a case defending a man on death row, Willie Miller. Willie was convicted of violently killing a young woman several years before. The problem is Willie can't remember anything about that night because he was too drunk. What is truly puzzling is that Willie gave up drinking for several months prior to the murder. Why would he start drinking that night? Andy is afraid of a cover-up. After receiving several threats against his life, he becomes much more convinced of Willie's ultimate innocence and must now try to save his life via an appeals trial.David Rosenfelt has written a swift moving legal thriller of a slight enough length that it can be consumed in one sitting. It certainly is compelling enough to keep one reading well into the night. However, characters are a bit stilted and one never quite shakes the feeling that the novel lacks any true originality. The wisecracking PI was all the rage in the mid to late 1990s. Resurrecting this character through Andy Carpenter almost seems redundant. Nonetheless, the novel remains entertaining and worth reading.

Francis Oliver is a death maiden in LA. This is a person who helps the dying cross over into the next world. (It is a fictional.) After witnessing the death of a young boy with the subsequent dispersal of his organs to recipients, she begins to suspect foul play. Her investigation into the matter proves her correct and now she must figure out just who is responsible and why.The premise of the story is quite clever. The creation of the death maiden works quite well within the context of the well paced plot. However, the author did not know when to pull in the reins and wrap it up thereby rendering the conclusion a bit too drawn out and complex. However, it is a well written debut worthy of a reader's time.

Wiley is a criminal and wanderer living life on the edge. For example, he robs drug dealers to get money on which to survive. His daughter, who he has not seen for quite some time, is found dead in an airport motel. Ironically, this murder gives his life some meaning in that he is committed to find the individual who murdered his daughter and make him pay. Fernando, the killer, is trying to cover all the tracks of his crime by killing those who have knowledge to link him to the murder. A cat and mouse game then is played out among a group of extremely unscrupulous and unpleasant characters.Mr. Waiwaiole has created a character rich work with some of the most unlikeable and least sympathetic characters a reader is likely to come across. The characters are so well developed and carefully created the author has completely neglected the plot of the story which is extremely slow and lacks any kind of pacing. Characters alone do not create a compelling story. The book borders on unreadable. However, the characters do rescue it from being a complete waste.

In Copenhagen, Cotton Malone, ex-Justice Department agent and current local bookseller, is to meet his old boss, Stephanie Nelle, at a cafe. Much to his amazement, he witnesses her purse being snatched by an unknown assailant. Cotton gives chase and succeeds in cornering the thief at the top of a tower. Inexplicably, the thief says a prayer, slits his throat and leaps to his death. Cotton and Stephanie soon embark on an adventure to discover the long lost treasure of the Templar Knights- the guardians of the Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Their foe is Raymond de Roquefort, a modern day Knight Templar who will stop at nothing to get the treasure himself including murder.It appears that any book with a radical historical perspective of Jesus will be marketed as another DAVINCI CODE. No matter what one thinks of the reality of the DAVINCI CODE, little would argue that as a thriller it succeeds on many levels including the plot and the pacing. THE TEMPLAR LEGACY does have an interesting premise with occasional episodes of thrilling chases and bloody encounters. The problem with this book lies in the editing. Simply put, the book is way too long. The chases and confrontations between the forces of good and evil become increasingly repetitive with endless expositions. Steve Berry should pay particular attention to the length of his books in the future. As far as this present volume, the author owes a great debt to Dan Brown for its best-selling status.

Arch Gold, public defender in NYC, has a difficult assignment. He is used to defending the guilty but now is asked to defend a young black man accused of killing a white woman on a Manhattan street. As the evidence comes in Gold becomes convinced of his innocence. However, the prosecutor strongly believes otherwise and is seeking the death penalty. Gold must get at the truth and prove his client's innocence to save his life.OFFER OF PROOF is the best debut legal thriller of the year. What makes this particular book so much better than the others is the stark simplicity of the tale. When things get a bit complex, Mr. Heilbrun has a talent for making the complex easy to read and allow the plot to flow with little or no interruption. This is not always easy to do. Characters are well portrayed and have no real flaws except for the somewhat stereotypic villain. Pacing is quite rapid consistent with the best of thrillers. One criticism is the author tried to get a bit too cute with the surprise ending which really came out of nowhere. However, this is a good example of a very worthy debut.

I have been reading the books of Greg Iles for years and have considered him one of the best and most topical thriller writers. Well, he finally wrote a dud. It almost makes me feel like shaking him by the shoulders demanding what he was thinking when he wrote this awful work.David Tennant is involved in a project called Trinity. The goal is to create a super computer-- the technology of which can change the world. He has doubts about the creation of something potentially so dangerous to mankind. When a fellow worker who has similar doubts is found dead, Tennant finds himself a marked man. He flees across the country with his psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, to not only evade capture and death but to try to stop the activation of the computer.What a mess! There appears to be a new sub genre of thrillers concerning the DNA computer. In fact, some of the best authors are writing about it including Michael Connolly and Michael Crichton among many others. This is the most preposterous one of all. Not only is this about the computer but somehow God figures into the equation as Tennant starts having dreams that he is Jesus. The conclusion is way beyond idiotic. However, Iles is a very good writer and until the last 75-100 pages manages to write a reasonably compelling novel He just didn't know when to stop.

One of my favorite thriller writers is Vince Flynn. He has written a series of novels featuring Mitch Rapp, a CIA assassin. They are, in essence the prototypical thriller novels. They all have supercharged high octane plots that compel the pages to fly by. The main character is superhuman and his mission is to save the civilized world.In this episode, Israel passes on information that Saddam Hussein is developing a nuclear arsonal beneath a hospital in Baghdad. To strike against this threat will require the death of hundreds of innocent lives as the hospital, itself, is bombed. Mitch is asked to help lead a mission to capture the bombs without a preemptive strike at the hospital. At the same time, powerful people in Washington want to stop the confirmation of Irene Kennedy as the new head of the CIA. They will stop at nothing to see her brought down even if it puts the mission into jeopardy.SEPARATION OF POWER represents another winning entry in the series of political thrillers Vince Flynn is writing. It has everything one could wish for in this subgenre - a compelling plot with lots of action, a hero that lives up to the role as superman with a love interest, lots of mean villains willing to kill to get their way, and the beautiful background scenery. The books are also quite topical.

Cavanaugh, a typical thriller hero, is a protector or bodyguard. He also helps make people disappear by creating new identities. Cavanaugh works for an agency called Global Protective Services. Their latest client is Daniel Prescott, a biochemist who has invented a hormone that may have military purposes and is being pursued by shadowy individuals trying to get their hands on the formula. When the organization goes to work, a disaster occurs leaving Cavanaugh to clean up the mess alone. He solicits the help of his wife, Jamie, who is most definitely not part of the business, to achieve his objective.David Morrell is a veteran thriller writer who has, in fact, created the character of Rambo. Cavanaugh is, of course, an ex member of the Delta force which accounts for his many extraordinary talents. He is another excellent creation and, in a sense, the prototypical thriller hero. Pacing is never a problem with this book as the plot moves along in a strong sure manner as we are in experienced hands. David Morrell considers this a &quot;trade craft novel&quot; meaning that interspersed throughout the book are numerous references as to how to perform certain deeds inherent to the profession such as escaping detection, how to protect individuals and how to obtain ready cash when away from home (wear a Rolex watch which can always be exchanged for money). Of course, our villain is over the top and a quite worthy opponent to Cavanaugh. The book is overall a fun fast read as all thrillers should be.

In Kaalbringen, a quaint seaside town in Sweden, the population lives in fear. Two men have been killed by an ax murderer. One is an ex-con while the other is a wealthy businessman. The relentless detective Chief Inspector Van Veeteren is assigned to the case. The stakes get higher when another body is found. Can Van Veeteren and the local police solve the crimes before more lives are lost?Hakan Nesser is a well known crime fiction writer in Europe. He has written a series of bestselling novels starring Inspector Van Veeteren. BORKMANN'S POINT is the first to be translated into English. The major strength of this work is the character of Van Veeteren. He is a likable detective, highly competent at what he does. The minor characters are also solid creations. This mystery is so character-driven that despite of the somewhat simple solution, the book as a whole works remarkably well. The setting of the seaside village is also described with great care. BORKMANN'S POINT won the best novel award for the Swedish Crime Writers' Academy in 1994. It is easy to see why.

Josiah Beede, &quot;Boy Hero of New Orleans&quot; who fought at the side of Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans, is a farmer in New England in the year 1837. He accompanies his freed slave and now friend, Randolph, to New Orleans in an effort to locate and free Randolph's wife Louisa. Meanwhile, Louisa decides to flee her plantation after she becomes pregnant by the white foreman. What she doesn't know is that her owner was murdered and Louisa is now the prime suspect. Josiah and Randolph must search the slave markets of New Orleans to try to locate Louisa before she is caught and possibly tried for murder.Clyde Linsley has written a very compelling historical mystery that very much brings to life New Orleans of the 1830s. He seamlessly intersperses the political and social issues of the day including the problem of dueling and cruelty of slavery. Characters are quite likeable and very well portrayed. I had some problems with the dialogue. For example, would a recently freed slave use words such as 'lascivious' or 'onerous'? The solution, however, is quite clever and satisfactory. A strong recommendation.

John Katzenbach is always an interesting writer. Every book is completely different than the one before. The author of the POW bestseller, HART'S WAR, goes in a completely different direction by writing a desert island type of thriller that takes place in the confines of an insane asylum located in Massachusetts.Francis Petrel, a young man, is committed to the Western State Hospital, an insane asylum about twenty years ago. He befriends some of the other lost souls residing there. Suddenly a trainee nurse is found brutally murdered and Francis becomes involved in the investigation after being tagged by a female DA, Lucy Jones, investigating the murder. Lucy,already branded by a large facial scar, is intent on catching the killer. Other dead bodies turn up and it appears a serial killer is on the loose. For the inmates there is no escape.John Katzenbach manages to effectively portray the life and environs of the insane asylum and cleverly tell a compelling story peopled with realistic characters. The major problem is the pacing which, at times, creeps along for a very severe length. There was ample opportunity to tighten up the storyand thus create a work of unbearable tension. Instead, this rambling tale loses much momentum as it proceeds to the inevitable and not totally surprising conclusion.

Henry Pierce, a technological wizard, owns a company which is developing a product that could change the face of medicine and earn him millions. After he moves into a new apartment, he plugs in his new phone. Almost immediately he is inundated with calls to a woman named Lilly who evidently works as an escort. Curious, Pierce decides to look into who this mysterious woman is and why she is not answering her calls. While searching for answers, Pierce must enter into a world of increasing danger and soon finds himself under suspicion for murder.Superlatives after superlatives is how Michael Connelly's book have been described . This book is no exception. The strength of a Connelly book is the characterizations and the plot full of twists. This is a standalone and, in a sense, differs from any other work by this author. A strong recommendation.

Walter Rothschild is an American Egyptologist living in London while working at the British Museum on an object of antiquity called the Stela of Paser. His job is to provide a definitive translation of it. He lives in a cramped London apartment with a fellow Egyptologist. One night while out with friends, he meets a beautiful young woman who seduces him after asking to see the antiquities of the museum after hours. The next morning she leaves but soon thereafter it is discovered that she stole a valuable Egyptian manuscript. Walter's trail of the stolen manuscript leads a possible ring of antiquities thieves. He must find the manuscript or his reputation is at stake.Matt Bondurant's debut effort is both a literary tour de force as well as a compulsive page turner. It is an original work that tries to say much about the human condition through vivid characters such as both Walter and his estranged daughter. There is much factual material of both Egyptian history, as well as, archeological lore. Not to mention the book is beautifully packaged. A worthwhile read

Christopher, the fifteen year old narrator of this remarkable debut novel, suffers with Asperger's Syndrone, a form of autism. One night he goes into his backyard and discovers his neighbor's dog dead with a pitchfork through it's body. Christopher, who loves mysteries, especially Sherlock Holmes, decides that he will solve this murder on his own. He travels the neighborhood trying to discover the cause of the dog's death in spite of the repeated admonitions from his father. What follows is a tale of discovery- not only about the murder of the dog but about what life is like with a severe form of autism.Not since MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN by Jonathan Lethem has mental illness been so sensitively and accurately depicted. This remarkable book allows the reader to get inside the head of an mentally impaired individual to discover how they think and what motivates them to behave the way they do. For instance, Christopher feels it will be a great day or a terrible day depending on how many Red vs. Yellow cars he sees. He doesn't like to be touched and as such never gets physically close to anyone. He is a math genius in spite of his other limitations. Through Christopher's eyes, the world is full of strangers that cannot be trusted. He carries a penknife with him for protection and will defend his personal space no matter the cost even if it involves hitting a policeman. His mother and father obviously love him but the tragedy is they are frustrated by their strong feelings of inadequacy in taking care of him. In fact, it is this feeling of inadequacy and lack of confidence that drives the events that unfurl in this story. The book is relatively slight yet packs a major whollop. Wonderful.

Jason Steadman is a thirty-year-old sales executive for a Japanese electronics company. He is going nowhere in life and appears content to stay the course but for a more ambitious wife. She pushes him into applying for a promotion, which under normal circumstances he would consider beyond his reach. But Jason has someone on his side who may make all the difference. He has befriended Kurt Semko,the tow truck driver whom he met while having damaged car removed from a scene of an accident (he was driving while talking on his cell phone). Kurt is ex-military special forces and is quite adept at working through the business hierarchy. With Kurt's help, Jason succeeds beyond his wildest imagination. But the price for his success might be more than Jason is willing to pay - his life.Joseph Finder is the best writer of corporate thrillers working today. His books start out as the tale of an everyman who soon gets caught up in a situation that spirals far beyond his control. The story gets increasingly complex and the pacing progressively accelerates. By the time the reader has gotten through the first few chapters, things are off and running. KILLER INSTINCT is virtually un-put-downable. It is easily one of the year's best thrillers and a perfect book for the summer months on the beach.

The Ian Rutledge series is one of the strongest historical mystery series in the genre. However, it has been my impression that the series is becoming a bit tired. There is not much more than can be done, in my opinion, with the series unless in some way Rutledge changes. So it is especially refreshing to see the Todds- Charles and Mom, Caroline, going in a slightly different direction with this particularly effective and atmospheric stand alone.In Devon, 1916 the effects of the First World War are being felt particularly hard. The young men are dying in battle and disappearing from the rural countryside. The loss is particularly harsh to Francesca Hatten who has lost five of her cousins. Now the man who raised her, her grandfather Francis Hatten, has passed away and with Francesca as his only heir, she receives everything. Among the possessions given to her by her solicitor is a hate letter to her grandfather. Why did he keep it? Furthermore, at the funeral a young man shows up and claims her grandfather murdered his mother. Could this be true?THE MURDER STONE is a slow, ponderous and complex mystery steeped in the historical era in which it occurs. The extensive list of characters in the front of the book might indicate just how complex the book might be. However, each character is so well developed that the list is quite superfluous. (This type of list could certainly prove helpful in so many other mysteries being published today but not this one.) As with the Rutledge books, the reader spends almost the entire book in the rural countryside. Two attempts Francesca makes to get into London are foiled (the first by a Zeppelin raid and the second by an injury). So wartime London is never described. Yet, the countryside is painted so realistically that the reader will welcome the ponderous pacing of the book. It is rural England during W.W.I that the Todds do so well and this is quite evident in this superb standalone. Highly recommended.

In central Ireland, farmers cutting into peat bog to obtain a means of fuel make a grizzly discovery. The severed head of a woman is found. Given that it has rested in the frigid water of the bog, it is in remarkably good condition. Features could easily be recognized including the bright red hair. The question is- who is she? It is up to Irish archaeologist Cormac Maguire and American pathologist Nora Gavin to discover her identity. In the meanwhile, people wonder whether this is the remains of Mina Osborne who disappeared two years before while returning home with her son from a shopping trip. The main suspect is Mina'a husband Hugh Osborne. Policeman Garrett Devaney investigates.HAUNTED GROUND is a literate crime novel. Ms. Hart is American, yet her writing style is purely British. The great sense of locale will immediately bring to mind the exceptional novels of Stephen Booth or Charles Todd. Her pacing is quite leisurely and the reader will find it difficult to traverse these pages rapidly. Characters are well fleshed out, however, I could not feel a connection to any of them. The writing is strong and sure, yet, when all is said and done, in spite of Ms. Hart writing a fine book, it is one I just did not enjoy reading.

Is Tory Troy insane? This is the question court-assigned psychiatrist Baraku Bexley must answer. It seems Tory, a euthanasia technician at a local animal shelter, has been accused of killing her six fellow workers in the gas chamber in the same manner she kills the unwanted animals. She must have been insane to do such a horrible deed - or was she?I place a very high value on originality and this debut novel has plenty of that. The story is told through a series of dialogues. It could be a dialogue between Tory and Dr. Bexley, or Tory and her mother. It could be a dialogue between lawyers or the jury. The point being that there is not a clear linear progression of the plot. Remarkably, the story is very well told and characters incredibly well portrayed without the usual descriptions. The dialogue is the strength of this book, of course. Without truly convincing dialogue, the story would die quickly. It is almost as if the writer was writing a script. A problem with the book is the frequent repetition such as the descriptions of the murders or Tory's mulling over her mortality. Regardless of this minor flaw, the book is a very well thought out truly compelling read and one that comes with a very strong recommendation.

It is in Loon Lake, Michigan, that Detective Louis Kincaid is offered a job. Kincaid, coming from a difficult time in Mississippi, is anxious to put the past behind him and start anew. Police Chief Brien Gibralter places Louis in charge of an investigation that has hit a dead end-the investigation of the murder of Police Officer Thomas Pryce killed in his home by an intruder with a shotgun. The killer left a calling card-a playing card with a number and a skull drawn on it. Perhaps the killer is a psychopath. When another member of the police force turns up dead, Kincaid wonders if the killer is a criminal who has been at odds with the Loon Lake Police. Nonetheless, in a community that rarely sees a serious crime, it is the members of the police that lives in constant fear of their lives.P. J. Parrish is the pseudonym of two sisters. Their collaboration is quite successful. The major strengths of this book are the exceptional characterization of the main protagonist, strong sense of place and the compelling plot. Kincaid, a black man trying to fit into a community where he doesn't really have a place, is a remarkably sympathetic figure. One could almost feel the constant chill of the air in the frigid and forbidding yet beautiful locale. The pacing is such that the book almost demands to be read at a single sitting in spite of its excessive length. Problems with the book include some character stereotypes. In spite of a very clever plot, mystery and solution, the authors had to resort to a clunky exposition culminating in the killer divulging all while the hero is held at gunpoint. Overall, DEAD OF WINTER is a superior mystery well worthy of the Edgar nomination

Moto, a Japanese secret agent was a shadowy figure in the series written by mainstream author John P. Marquand in an effort to put food on the table. NO HERO is the first in the series and was written in 1935 as war was heating up in Europe and the question of war between the US and Japan very much in the forefront. The formula for these half dozen books was set with this one. A handsome American pilot is approached by a beautiful mysterious blonde woman after the pilot has verbalized some misgivings about his country while in a drunken rage. She takes him to meet Mr. Moto who offers the pilot the opportunity to fly across the Pacific if he accepts an assignment. The assignment consists of sailing to China where he will be given his orders. While onboard the ship, an oriental man called Mah asks him to deliver a message to someone in China. The message is the key to the mission yet all remains confusing as the pilot must flee the ship with his life threatened.The story, dialogue and characters are all dated. Nonetheless, the writing remains quite excellent given the writing style reflecting the times. The shadowy underworld of Oriental espionage is well conveyed in this relatively simplistic tale that actually almost appears written for Hollywood. NO HERO is a very quick read well suited to one sitting. As classic as the movie that was based on it.

THE WHITE RUSSIAN by Tom Bradby (Bantam, 17.99)Tom Bradby has written several novels in widely varied styles. First he wrote a couple of thrillers, SHADOW DANCER and SLEEP OF THE DEAD, then he moved onto his breakout book THE MASTER OF RAIN which was his first book published in the United States. MASTER takes place in 1926 Shanghai. This historical mystery was nominated for last year's Steel Dagger Award and was very well received. Now he returns with another superb historical mystery. This time we go to St. Petersburg, Russia in 1917 on the virge of revolution.Two bodies are found on the frozen river, Neva. Sandro Ruzsky, chief police investigator, is assigned to the case. He manages to discover the identity of the bodies- one being a former member of the imperial household and the other is an American gangster. What is their relationship and who killed them? To answer these questions Sandro must visit the Palace of the Tzar in St. Petersburg, as well as the cities of Yalta and Moscow. The key to the murders might also lie with the ballerina, Maria Popova, a love of Sandro's. There are issues in Sandro's past that also need resolution including his relationship with his father, a Minister of the Interior, as well as his estranged wife and their young son.There are several different types of novels in this book. In a sense, I wasn't sure where the author was going. He probably didn't know himself. Initially the plot is a straightforward police procedural with the backdrop of the historical location and era. However, as we began to explore Sandro's relationship with Maria, the love story of DR ZHIVAGO comes to mind. Finally, the historical events take over the plot and given the explosive nature of the politics at that time, this is actually quite appropriate. The depth of the characters, the complexity of the murders and the rich historical detail make this another exceptional work by this highly talented and versatile author.

Utopia is one of the most advanced and realistic theme parks in the world. It has four separate divisions each offering their own thrills as patrons are immersed into the future, A boardwalk resort, Camelot or Victorian England. However, problems are occurring. Computers appear to be malfunctioning. Dr. Andrew Warne, a computer engineer and creator of the computer system in the park is called in to solve the problem. Unfortunately, a Mr. John Doe appears and claims responsibility for the mishaps. He plans to kill the patrons unless they turn over to him the program used to run the parks-- a revolutionary program that could be used militarily with great destruction if placed into the wrong hands. Warne and his colleagues must try to stop him.Lincoln Child is a master of the technothriller. He renders much detail into his descriptions of these parks. Quite fascinating is the descriptions of the machinations of the running of a theme park. There is much superfluous plot inserted into the already compelling story line. It served to bulk up the novel unnecessarily. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to give any of the roller coasters a true competition. Overall, it is a fun book-- quite entertaining and recommended.

There is a certain simplicity in KILLING FLOOR, the first novel by Lee Child featuring his hero Jack Reacher. The character hits us with no past and no real thought for the future. He reacts to what is wrong and tries to right it. There is a pervasive sense of morality with violence as the ultimate result of these wrongs. It is a thriller in its most pure and unblemished form. It can be read superficially with little lost by the reader. In the subsequent six books, we learn more and more about Reacher. Now with the latest, THE ENEMY, we travel back in time to 1990 antedating the first novel by several years- a prequel. It is easily the most complex and accomplished novels of the series to date.New Year's Eve, 1990 finds Reacher, an MP of the US army, investigating the death of a general found in a sleazy hotel room in a remote rural region. It appears that he died of a heart attack. When Reacher travels to the General's house to tell his wife, he finds her also dead but murdered. As Reacher investigates, Special Forces members begin to die also by murder. Reacher must solve the crimes as he is being set up by somebody unknown to take the fall.THE ENEMY is a highly complex murder mystery. In this sense it is very different than the other Reacher books. The others are more of the thriller subgenre whereas this one is more of a police procedural. Given that this is a new style and format for Lee Child, there are some inherent problems- the mystery is a bit too complex requiring several long expositions at the end to wrap it all up. The expositions could be a bit difficult to fully comprehend. However, the characters are well sketched and there is a certain sense of realism- more so than in previous books. Perhaps this is a testament to the increasing skill of the already highly regarded author. We can expect more from Lee Child with each successive book.

Java Falcon, homicide detective working in Seville, Spain is confronted by several problems. First of all, he must investigate the brutal murder of a local restaurateur who was found with his eyelids removed evidently forced to watch something and killing himself trying to get out of the restraints. Falcon is particularly affected by the mutilated eyelids. The second issue concerns a journal written by his dead father, a famous artist. Falcon was asked to destroy the journal in a letter written by his father just prior to his death, However, he disobeys and in stark detail learns what a depraved and damaged man his father was. The third problem is Falcon facing his own demons as he deals with the journal and the murder. Will his struggle prove to be truly self destructive?First of all, this is most definitely not a book that appeals to my personal taste. It is long- very very long and is written in such a leisurely introspective style that it actually reads much longer than it is. The British call this a thriller and I simply cannot fatham why. I would also not characterize the book as compelling or even enjoyable. To be honest, I couldn't wait to finish it. Yet its excellence cannot be denied. The writing is lyrical. Falcon's personal angst is so deep and well thought out that his character becomes breathtakingly lifelike. There is great complexity in both segments of the plot- the journal of Falcon's father, as well as, Falcon's story. There is greatness here- that cannot be denied. This book reminds me of the classics of literature that we had to read in school- great books that challenged the reader. The bottom line is the book is not fun but is highly worthwhile.

Master spy Paul Christopher has disappeared. He went in search of his mother who has not been seen in decades- not since the end of WWII. Paul's cousin, Horace, is sent ashes back from China purported to be Paul's and he is buried with full honors. However, Horace is not convinced Paul is dead and enlists five other retired CIA agents with specialties in regions around the world. Their search places them at odds with a mad Arab terrorist, Ibn Awad, who Horace has tried to kill once before unsuccessfully. At stake is possibly millions of lives.Charles McCarry has served for years as a deep undercover agent for the CIA. It is this experience that lends a great sense of realism and immediacy to this book. This is the major strength of the work. Spywork can be drudgery and there are many passages that reflect that making the reading of these passages drudgery as well. This book is long- so very very long and unnecessarily so. The stakes are high so should be the level of interest by the reader. However, it is the sheer volume of the book and the mutiple deadend subplots that make the plot so jerky. However, the writing is strong and sure and characters well constructed. I would prefer a tighter plot with a riveting storyline. It is, nonetheless worth reading.

However, his whole life starts to unravel when he is arrested for the pictures. While imprisoned his home is destroyed in an explosion. Lime must discover who wants him dead and why.Leif Davidsen has written a compelling tale of a man's loss and the necessary path he must take into his past to get at the reason for his loss. It also concerns how he deals with rebuilding his life. This is a well written tale but there are many instances where Mr. Davidsen gets bogged down in details with a resultant slackening of the pace. Nonetheless, a recommended read.

Doc Ford, marine biologist, finds an old friend waiting for him on his boat in Dinkin's Bay. His friend,Sally Minster, has recently lost her husband in a boating accident when he disappeared at sea. It is felt that he is dead but there is some evidence that this might not be the case. Before his assumed death, her husband was involved in a cult group run by a man called Bhagwan Shiva. Shiva is planning an event to increase his net worth with some unsavory characters. Ford investigates and what he finds out could be quite explosive.I have read the Doc Ford books since Ford made his first appearance running out of a tunnel naked in SANIBEL FLATS. Talk about symbolism! However, after one decidedly bad book and a couple of mediocre books, I felt the series was becoming a bit flat. In fact, I had stopped reading the series after book number six, THE MANGROVE COAST. I decided to give the series one more try. After reading it my feelings are mixed. The book reminds me of two things. The first is how good a storyteller Randy Wayne White is and how solid a creation Doc Ford is. The book gets off to a rollicking start with some wacky characters that seem to run rampant in so many of today's Florida mysteries. Then a third of the way into the book I was reminded as to why I stopped reading the series. The author, in addition to telling the story, feels the overwhelming need to lecture the reader on a whole host of issues. For example, we are treated to a history of the Everglades, as well as a history of earthquakes in Florida, the Seminole Indian tribe, and general Florida history. We also learn about Florida geography and geology among many other topics. It is obvious Randy Wayne White loves the state- especially environmentally and he never hesitates to let the reader know it. Of course, this serves to slow down the pacing of the increasingly unrealistic plot. I still feel the series is getting stale and, perhaps, Mr. White would do well to follow the lead of Harlan Coben, Bob Crais and Dennis Lehane among many others and go to a few standalones. He has the talent and ability to meet with the same success those authors achieved with the standalones. Until then, I wish Mr. White and Doc Ford well but won't be coming by to visit for a while.

Dan Fesperman's first novel was the highly regarded and John Creasey Memorial Dagger winner LIE IN THE DARK. Never before had I read such an all encompassing detailed account of life in war torn Bosnia. That book ended with the main protagonist, Detective Vlado Petric fleeing Sarejevo to join his wife and young daughter in Berlin. This book starts about five years later. The war is over but Bosnia lies in ruins. Petric, living in Berlin, makes a living working as a construction worker. He receives a visit from a mysterious American, Calvin Pine, who invites him to join in on an assignment for the International War Crimes Tribunal. They want Petric to capture a war criminal in Bosnia. The assignment sounds relatively well thought out and straightforward. He agrees but soon finds it much more than he bargained for. It also calls into question his own father's role in perpetuating atrocities during W.W.II.The fact that this book was nominated for an Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller is a bit of a surprise. This is definitely not a thriller. It is more appropriate a nominee in the Gold dagger category. The style of writing is much too careful and deliberate for a thriller. The pacing is languid but the descriptions, once again, are detailed and breathtaking. Bosnia is very different today than it was when we last visited it during the war. The resilience of the people is what makes this book linger in the mind. Dan Fesperman does not rush his books into print in that it has been four years since the last one. It is definitely well worth the wait.

Brinker is a PI working in Tucson, Arizona. A former INS agent who worked the US border with Mexico, he retired after being shot on duty apparently by one of his fellow agents. Brinker is hired by a local wealthy businessman, Mo Crain, to look into his wife's recent murder. Brinker's investigation takes him into contact with his old border patrol and the man who possibly tried to murder him. Of course, the investigation leads Brinker into danger with, not only his own life at stake but that of the woman he loves.James C. Mitchell has written a competent but highly formulaic PI novel. There are little surprises here. The strength of the book are the characters and the depiction of the locale. The conclusion is predictable and with the obligatory scene of the villain holding the gun on the hero, the plot is very routine. Overall, a forgettable work but enjoyable enough while it lasts.

Robin Cook is considered the master of the medical thriller. A best-selling author since his debut novel COMA, Robin Cook sets the bar as to what it takes to write a solid medical thriller. In this case, his book revolves around the possibility of using genetic engineering to cure diseases.Senator Ashley Butler has Parkinson's disease. He has Presidential aspirations and will seek out any possible cure of the disease no matter how long the odds are. He focuses in on a promising start up company run by Dr. Daniel Lowell who invented a technique to implant DNA into the brain to stop the disease. The problem is that it has never been tested on humans. Butler doesn't care and demands the treatment while holding over Daniel's head the possible passage of a bill that will kill his company. Will it work?Cook weaves a whole book around the premise of genetic engineering. Given his long-term history of writing medical thrillers, he has a whole host of stock devices in an attempt to create a more exciting plot. However, the plot gets increasingly contrived and unrealistic as the book moves along. Is it really necessary to throw Italian gangsters into the mix? Why must the DNA come from a certain substance that reeks of divinity? Stock characters do not add any substance to the work. The disappointing and predictable ending is an appropriate exclamation point for this bit of fluff.

Free Meeker, a nineteen-year-old free spirit and soon to be an unwed mother is involved in a fatal pile up on a highway blinded by a dust storm. She survives but a fellow passenger, a hitchhiker, named Lydia, is killed. Lydia was running away from an abusive relationship with her husband. After finding a gym bag filled with drug money, Free decides to assume Lydia's identity and run away to start a new life for herself and her, as yet, unborn child. Of course, life is never so simple. Looking for Lydia is her enraged husband and Don Cannon, a drug dealer who desperately needs the money that Free has found or he will, himself, be killed.April Henry has written a stand-alone novel with the subtext of "a thriller", Actually, LEARNING TO FLY should be more properly called a novel of suspense. April's novel is character driven while most true thrillers would be considered plot driven. The difference, as I see it, between the two is that the pacing would be much more rapid with the plot driven thrillers. The character driven thrillers must, by definition, move slower to allow the reader the time to get to know the character. April succeeds in creating an interesting yet sympathetic figure in Free Meeker. There are some character motivations that were not completely explained such as why a young policeman would be interested in an unwed pregnant woman. Otherwise, LEARNING TO FLY is a well-written novel that should appeal to readers on the beach or in the air. Personally, I would like to see a bit of a tighter plot but this one certainly succeeds as is.

As Bosch looks into it, he discovers that someone tampered with Terry's heart medication. At the same time, it seems a killer has reemerged nicknamed The Poet. FBI agent, Rachel Walling is on his trail. The Poet was formerly her mentor and chief in the FBI. As she follows the trail of bodies to a desert site outside of Las Vegas, Bosch's investigation leads him to the same location. They decide to join forces to capture this very dangerous and worthy adversary before he kills again.THE NARROWS is just another example of Mike Connelly doing what he does best- simply writing the best crime fiction novels being published today replete with superbly sketched characters and frequent plot twists and turns including one big zinger at the end. Mike's books should be carefully studied by anyone wanting to write in this subgenre. It simply doesn't get better.

Alex Nadel travels to Spain after receiving word that his aunt has passed away. He wants to look at the farm that he has inherited which is located near Barcelona. What is especially surprising to Alex is that his aunt was, until recently, still alive. He was told that she was killed during the Spanish Civil War over sixty years ago. Things begin to look highly suspicious when he is threatened unless he agrees to sell the property. Alex, of course, resists, and this sets up the story's conflict as Alex finds himself in increasing danger. Eventually he learns the truth as to why his father left the country and why his land is so valuable to some people.Stereotypic characters, a surprisingly slow plot and unnecessary complexity keep this debut novel from truly rising above the ordinary. Yet, the mystery, itself, keeps the pages turning. Stephen Burgen, in future books, should concentrate more on plot progression and story line and less on plot complexity. Nonetheless, the writing is strong and the book makes for a mildly diverting read.

Several quite fascinating plots make up this remarkable debut by British author, Ed O'Connor. The first concerns a serial killer who has an obsession with the poet John Donne. He uses his poetry as the basis for murder. For some reason, he removes the left eye of his victims and keeps it while leaving a quote from Donne's poetry in blood on the wall. It is up to the local police including Inspector John Underwood to solve the crime before the killer strikes again. Aiding in their investigation is Donne scholar, Heather Stussman who is contacted, not only by the police, but, the killer as well.Inspector Underwood, however, must deal with his own private hell. His wife of eighteen years is having an affair and it appears his marriage is near the end. His personal life is interfering with his professional life to the extent that he is placing his wife's lover on his list of possible suspects as the killer.Ed O'Connor displays a remarkable ability, in his first novel, of balancing strong sympathetic characters with a plot that truly makes the reader want to turn the next page. It is not only a gruesome serial killer novel but an intellectual one, as well. Consider it a combination of Thomas Harris (who writes the quintessential serial killer novel with the Hannibal Lecter books) , Ian Rankin (with his depth of characters and balancing several plots) and Reginald Hill (with the academic logic in the killings). There are few weaknesses in this work. Perhaps, it is a bit too gruesome. Perhaps it is a bit too long. However, the whole justifies the means. This is a strong recommendation. Warning: not for the faint of heart.

KJ Erickson's first book. THIRD PERSON SINGULAR, was one of my favorite books of the last year. It was nominated for the Barry Award. The strength of the book lies in the superb characterizations and apparently effortless writing. With this, her second book, Ms. Erickson, once again, reveals her prodigious skills.Mars Bahr, Minneapolis Homicide Detective, is back. When a friend approaches him and asks him to look into the death of a man, an apparent suicide, he discovers the most probable cause of death is murder. A mysterious set of numbers is found on the man's arm. The noose that he hung himself with is made of a very unusual type of cloth not used in this country for decades. Mars and his partner, Nettie Frisch, investigate. As they look into leads, there appears to be a connection to the victims and their ancestor's involvement in the Battle of Gettysburg.Again, characters are rendered with vital realism. Mars is a sympathetic character quite easy to like. His trials and tribulations are of much interest to the reader. A problem with this book is that, perhaps the author was trying to do too much. The Civil War connection implies a strong agenda Ms. Erickson was trying to follow. I found this aspect of the story to be a bit of a stretch of reality. It also made the plot a bit too unnecessarily complicated. However, Ms. Erickson still manages to do enough right to make this book an above average effort. Ms. Erickson would do well to concentrate on simpler plots and letting her characters shine. Anyway, Ms. Erickson is for real. A strong recommendation.

Serial killer novels are always in danger of becoming quite redundant. If they are read one after the other, they might appear to be difficult to distinguish. For example, cute and clever killings has been done again and again. Immediately coming to mind are the fine novels of John Connelly. Of course, Thomas Harris must always be conjured up with his Lechter novels. Jonathan Santlofer throws his debut novel into the mix and it is the very lack of originality that that I find most irritating.Kate McKinnon is an ex-cop who has become a famous art historian by hosting her own PBS series. People close to her begin to die. They are murdered and their bodies are arranged similar to famous paintings. Kate, a friend of the NYPD chief of police, is allowed to participate with the police in helping them crack this tough case. As she investigates, it soon becomes apparent that the killer is targeting her.Kate is an interesting protagonist and one the reader would like to meet. However, she appears a bit too tailor made for the role she plays. How many leave the police force to become famous art historians? I had a lot of trouble buying into this concept. However, once the reader accepts this, it is noted that she is very well created. The other characters are a mixed bunch-- some are sketchily developed and others are quite stereotypic. As noted previously, the killings lack originality in their very nature of trying to be unique. The plot races along quite nicely to the less than satisfactory conclusion. The killer is a character I did not remember meeting previously. In a sense, this is cheating. The bottom line, a less than spectacular effort in a book lacking originality and a bit too long.

CALIFORNIA GIRL by T. Jefferson Parker (Morrow, $24.95) Rating: A-In the 1960s Orange County California, the beheaded body of a young woman is found in an abandoned citrus packing house. The woman, Janelle Vonn, a beauty queen who sunk into drugs and promiscuous sex is well known by the Becker brothers. Several years before, the four Becker brothers fought Janelle's brothers over a baseball cap. The bad blood has since dried up and the two families are friends. Nick Becker, a homocide detective is assigned to the case. This is his first case as the lead detective. He wants to see justice done for many reasons. David Becker, Nick's brother, is a priest with a large following but has a secret he wants to keep. Andy Becker is a reporter for the local paper and wants the inside scoop on the hot story. Through the brothers and all their relationships is told this tragic tale.There is no doubt that Jeff Parker is a superb writer. His novels seeth with vivid realism. This one is no exception. The problem is the leisurely pacing leading to excessive length, from my perspective. The story could have been much tighter and, in fact, it isn't until two-thirds of the way through that the plot picks up considerably. A few twists lead to a satisfying conclusion. This book has been nominated for the Edgar Award as best first novel. It is a worthy nominee.

A shipload of illegal Chinese immigrants sinks off the coast of Long Island. It appears an explosion has occurred which succeeded in destroying not only the ship but killing many of the passengers onboard. One of the survivors is a smuggler of the Chinese into this country. He is a ruthless killer nicknamed "The Ghost" because he has never been caught and always is ahead of the authorities. The Ghost is intent on killing any of the other survivors of the ship. Involved in the manhunt to capture the killer is the quadriplegic police investigator, Lincoln Rhyme, with his assistant, Amelia Sachs. Rhyme has set up a police lab in his apartment and with the help of the officers in his division, is involved in a cat and mouse chase of The Ghost.Jeffrey Deaver has written another successful thriller starring one of his most memorable creations, Lincoln Rhyme. Much effort and empathy has gone into the subplot of the plight of the illegal Chinese immigrant. In attempting to write a nonstop action thriller, Jeffrey Deaver resorts to certain stock devices such as some of the impossible escapes of the villain. Sometimes Lincoln's assumptions based on the evidence presented to him are a bit of a stretch. This is something that has occurred in the other Lincoln Rhyme novels. However, characters are well thought out and the story is quite clever and entertaining. Overall, a recommended read

Bill Smith, is a PI working in NYC. His partner is Chinese-American, Lydia Chin. Together they are the main protagonists of the highly successful series by S.J. Rozan.Bill Smith receives a late night call that they are holding his nephew, Gary, at the station for attempting to rob a sleeping homeless man. Bill goes to the station and agrees to take Gary home. Gary, however, refuses to tell Bill why he fled from his New Jersey home away from Bill's sister and brother-in-law who has almost a pathologic hatred of Bill. In fact, when Gary is given the opportunity, he escapes from Bill's apartment. Bill takes it upon himself to discover what Gary is up to and where he ran off to. His search takes him to the affluent suburban community and to the root of a possible cover-up of a crime that occurred decades ago the effects of which reverberate even today.S.J. Rozan writes one of the most literate and finest series in crime fiction today. Unique is her ability to keep her series fresh by change in point of view and the locale. Some books are written with Lydia Chin as first person narrator and others, such as this one, with Bill Smith. Her characters are always interesting, yet, some can appear a bit over the edge. The plot has plenty of twists to keep any reader turning the pages late at night. Especially clever with this book is the exposition scenes at the end. She manages to avoid the clich&eacute; of the killer holding the gun on the hero just prior to killing him while divulging all for page after page. The exposition is accomplished mostly via a phone call to a news reporter. This is the Edgar Award winning best novel for 2003.

Edward Wozny is off to England after a transfer from New York as a banker. He has two weeks before he leaves and spends the time visiting friends in New York prior to his departure. However, he is given one unusual assignment before leaving. He is asked to sort through and catalogue a large antique book collection belonging to a couple of English nobility. While sorting through, he is asked by the Duchess to find a codex written by a Gervase of Langford. Edward soon enlists the help of a medieval scholar, Margaret Napier, for help. However, it seems the Duke wants it even more than his wife for some unknown reason. Edward must choose where his loyalty lies.I am not quite sure where the author was heading with this book. There is much literary history and a somewhat rollicking plot. Lev Grossman never seems to have a true affinity for the creating of characters and it shows in his portrayal of the Duke and Duchess who come off wooden. Edward's friends are stereotypes and Margaret is truly bizarre. All leads to a lack of reader identification and as such no sympathy. The ending is highly unsatisfying with little imaginative imput. All in all a modest effort.

One of the problems I have with some of the so-called traditional mysteries is that the author becomes so enamored with the characters that he or she delves into every tiny aspect of their existence completely ignoring the simple fact that they are supposed to be telling a story. These books,though highly touted by some, prove to be pure drudgery to others- myself included. MURDER OFF MIKE is one of those books. It also won the St. Martin's Press/ Malice Domestic Contest for Best First Novel Traditional Mystery.Shauna J. Bogart is a talk radio show host in Sacramento, California. She is startled one day when a caller tells her he has witnessed a murder then hangs up. The murder witnessed is that of Dr. Hipster another host of talk radio and her mentor. The police are calling it a suicide. However, through subtle clues, Shauna is convinced Dr. Hipster was murdered goes about trying to prove it.Joyce Krieg did a very good job in creating her characters. It really is the major redeeming value of this overwritten and overblown debut. The talk radio industry she describes is not interesting enough to compel the reader to turn the pages. The pacing is so lethargic that by the time we reach the conclusion, we really don't care. A very average debut.

Serial killer thrillers are not necessarily for everyone. There have been so many mediocre attempts that readers have been turned off by them as a whole. However, I think there is always room for another if it is as well done as this latest novel by Rick Mofina.In San Francisco, a lonely young woman is brutally killed. The audacity of her murder makes headlines. Detective Walt Sydowski leads the investigation. Among his crew is Inspector Ben Wyatt, a cop ostracized and blamed for the shooting of his partner when he himself failed to shoot an armed suspect because he claimed a child was being used as a shield by the criminal. The problem is that nobody believes him including Sydowski. Parallel to their investigation is Ben Reed, reporter for the San Francisco Star. Reed is under intense pressure from his editor to break exclusive news in the story. They all soon discover that a serial killer is at work prying on lonely women throughout the country.Rick Mofina is a very talented writer capable of creating not only exceptional characters but a plot that is so riveting that pages literally fly by. The pacing is especially impressive. The story starts out quick, slows down for character development then accelerates to a rapid, yet satisfying climax. Rick Mofina is a news reporter and his writing skills are immediately apparent. His first book has been nominated for the Arthur Ellis award in Canada. So he is well regarded there. He deserves a large following in this country, as well. Highly recommended.

One of the best writers of the genre is the 2002 Edgar Award winning author, T. Jefferson Parker. He is capable of, not only writing a superior mystery ,but of writing it in style. His books delve deep into the psyche of the main protagonists. SILENT JOE, his Edgar winning stand alone is quite typical of this. The characters are unforgettable and alone can make it a worthwhile read. Detective Merci Rayborn is also a character well examined in his work. In Parker's hands she becomes a living breathing creation.Merci Rayborn is assigned to look into the death of a young woman. The dead woman was the wife of Deputy Archie Wildcraft, a young talented cop. Archie was also shot and suffers from a bullet wound in the head. Prosecutors are pointing the finger at Archie in that the gun was found in his hand. They think it was a shooting death and suicide attempt. Merci, however, feels Archie is innocent and wants to prove it. Her investigation, once again, puts her reputation at stake. However, Merci follows her personal conviction and attempts to discover the true killer.T. Jefferson Parker's strength as a writer is on full display in this, his latest novel. Merci is tough and an individualist. The plot is compelling enough to keep the pages turning. However, it definitely went on a bit too long. By the end, Merci and the reader have had enough. A bit of a tighter plot would suit Parker's books quite well. However, he is and should be listed among the best there is writing today.

One of the year's most polished debuts concerns a retired Philadelphia police officer, Max Freeman. Freeman was responsible for gunning down a black youth during a robbery attempt. In spite of the fact that he was almost killed, he lives with the guilt and retires from the police force. He decides to flee civilization and travels to the Florida Everglades where he purchases a desolate house in the midst of the swamp. One day, as he canoes along the waterway, he discovers the body of a missing child who was abducted from home. It appears a serial killer is on the loose kidnapping and killing children in the new developments bordering the Everglades. Of course, with his unstable past, suspicion is initially thrown on Max who finds he getting closer and closer to the crimes. He must solve them himself or he might very well go down for the murders.In reading a first novel such as THE BLUE EDGE OF MIDNIGHT, one is immediately struck by the strong sure style of writing that is quite reminiscent of an individual who makes a living using language. Jonathon King is a journalist and has been for over twenty years. It almost isn't fair to compare the beauty of these smooth flowing passages to other debut authors who do not write for a living. King may remind the reader of another journalist who decided to pursue a writing career through the crime fiction genre, Michael Connelly. Yes, he is that good. The description of the locale lends it a great deal of immediacy. The characters are true to life and their dialogue quite natural. However, the most important thing is Mr. King knows how to tell a compelling story and does so without very much filler material. The book is the length it must be-no shorter and no longer. The reader must truly appreciate that. This is one of the best debuts I have read so far this year.

Minette Walters has put together a body of work over the last ten years that has rarely been equaled. THE ICE HOUSE is considered one of the 100 favorite mysteries of the century by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Books like THE SCULPTRESS are unforgettable in the power of the depiction of the title character. She now comes out with one of her best novels in years.Bassindale Estates is a decrepit housing project in England. A sign off the road was vandalized and reads "Welcome to Assi d Row" Hence, the title of the book. Acid Row is "A place of deprivation where literacy was poor, drugs endemic and fights commonplace." Into this volatile mix is placed a pedophile. After a young girl disappears, angry residents hear of this and they organize a protest. Unfortunately, the protest quickly turns into mob rule with the possibility of violence and rioting just under the surface. By juxtaposing points of view, the reader is given access to all parts of this event. Sophie Morrison, a young physician from the local health clinic is unknowingly enters the apartment of the pedophile and is placed into the center of the maelstrom. The local police are helpless and must solicit aid from local residents. The individuals who try to help must become surprising heroes. While this event escalates, the police continue to work the case of the missing child.Minette Walters examines the psyche of an unruly mob. Once she sets the stage for the confrontation, she does not let go of the thread of suspense. She ensures the reader's unwavering attention by use of a gripping narrative and skillful characterizations. There are several times that Ms. Walters loses some focus but these times are rare. ACID ROW is an excellent example of why Minette Walters is considered a modern master of the genre. This is a very worthy nominee of the CWA Gold Dagger Awards.

Marty Kalish, an investment banker, is in the midst of a heated affair with a married woman. Marty's lover, Rachel Reinardt, wife of a respected cardiothoracic surgeon, confesses to Marty that her husband, when intoxicated, has beaten her and has, in fact, threatened to kill her. Fearing for her life, Marty watched their house one night and witnesses what he believes to be the prelude to a murder. That night the doctor disappears, presumably murdered. A short time later, Marty is questioned as a suspect and later arrested for murder. However, the questions remain. What happened that night and is Marty, in fact, a murderer? Marty will go on trial in an attempt to determine the truth.LINE OF VISION is a truly riveting courtroom drama. Great care is exercised in describing events leading up to the first day of trial. This allows certain facts to be placed in front of the reader. However, it also allows ample opportunity for red herrings to be inserted into the complex plot. By the time the reader reaches the surprising conclusion, their head will be spinning over the many twists and turns of the plot. In addition to David Ellis's impressive ability to tell a captivating tale, he also excels at creating rich characterizations, especially that of Marty. One problem with this debut is the length. Episodes, at times, appear aimless and the author took way too long in setting up the courtroom scenes. Nonetheless, LINE OF VISION is a remarkable first novel and well worthy of it's Edgar nomination.

John Rain is an assassin living in Tokyo. Born of mixed Japanese-American parentage, he was trained by the Special Forces in the US and is a veteran of the Vietnam war. Now he is available for hire to see that certain individuals 'die of natural causes'. After killing a Japanese executive, he falls for his daughter, a jazz pianist. Unfortunately, his next assignment is killing the daughter. He has two days to decide to accept the assignment. Rain decides to utilize the time to find out who wants her dead and why.John Rain is one of the most original creations I have encountered so far this year. He meets the criteria of a thriller hero with his special forces training and being a loner with a love interest. It is not, however, the world he is trying to save. Rain is truly ruthless. He kills without any remorse and frequently with his bare hands. Yet, he is quite a sympathetic character to the reader. Barry Eisler keeps his story moving swiftly to the inevitable but highly satisfying conclusion. I look forward to Rain's next episode.

Here it is- another serial killer novel. Not only that but a serial killer novel in which an incarcerated madman helps the law enforcement agent solve a crime. Sound familiar? How about a previous one that was made into a motion picture that won Oscars for best picture, actor, actress and director? Perhaps another novel might lack just a tinge of originality? You decide.In Mobile Alabama, Detective Carson Ryder is searching for a serial killer. The killer decapitates its victims and writes messages on the bodies. A true psychopath who seems to be getting closer and closer to Ryder. To possibly seek answers, Ryder consults his mad brother institutionalized for similar crimes. To complicate matters (and create a damsel in distress) Ryder, for some inexplicable reason, wants to help a sullen, depressed and quite hostile pathologist, Ava Davenelle, combat alcoholism. Could all of these loose ends be tied together into one cohesive but unrealistic plot? Of course.Jack Kerley tries to explore the same old tired plot lines of the typical serial killer novel. He does, however, succeed in staking out a small bit of space in distinguishing himself by concentrating on the characters and their relationships vs. the shadowy serial killer whose identity we are not privy to until the final pages. Suspense is thereby maintained throughout. Major characters are very well sketched but the more minor ones are superficial and stereotypic (such as the snarling police chief out to get Ryder). However, the plot did drag a bit too much for this reader and in spite of the overall good writing, the book is only mildly recommended.

Logan and Tyler Griffin agree to become part of an experiment after being, what they consider, well paid for the risk. Unbeknownst to themselves, they will be turned invisible- apparently irreversible. The Townsend family are on a camping vacation in the Everglades. They stumble upon a deserted campsite with a lone dog as an inhabitant. A sudden light blinds them and much to their dismay turns them invisible, as well. The organization that is running the experiment wants secrecy at all costs- even if it means the lives of the Townsend family. The Townsends must flee from their unknown pursuers and eventually team up with Logan to fight this enemy.Calling OUT OF SIGHT a mystery is open to debate. Invisibility falls much more easily into the science fiction genre. If the reader does not fully buy into the premise that individuals might be turned invisible, the entire book may not work. The fact that the book was nominated for a prestigious award is surprising considering how silly the basic premise of the book actually is. Mystery fans expect at least a semblance of realism. It is hard to get that in this sci-fi thriller. Besides, the pacing is relatively slow with a length that appears endless. A disappointing nomination in an otherwise impressive group.

Michael Bracken has written eight novels and hundreds of short stories published all over the world. He is also virtually unknown to the mystery community as a whole. Perhaps one reason is that, at least, his latest novel, ALL WHITE GIRLS is published by a very small press. Another reason might be that he writes a very dark hard-boiled novel which might not appeal to the majority of mystery and crime readers. In any event, he writes with a unique style and is well worth reading.In Chicago, former partners, PI Dick Rickenbacher and Homicide Lieutenant Salvador Castellano, are separately involved in cases involving girls of the seedy area of strip clubs. Rickenbacher is hired by a father searching for his eighteen year old daughter. His search takes him to the strip at the same time a female body is found dead in a flop house. Castellano is investigating that one. As we follow Rickenbacher, we are exposed to the underside of life in Chicago. We meet hookers, pimps, alcoholics, drug addicts, killers and the cops who try to keep them straight. In the able hands of Michael Bracken it is a descent into the bowels of hell.Michael Bracken has a very unique voice in the subgenre of hard-boiled crime fiction. There are only antiheroes here where death is often seen as a release and murder is taken way too casually. There is little in the form of descriptions as the plot moves along rough and tough like a jackhammer tearing up a street. Relationships are temporary and a happy ending is well beyond belief. For a relatively brief novel, Michael Bracken packs quite a whollop. He is not for everybody but if noir fits your taste, don't pass him by. A strong recommendation.

It is interesting and can be quite illustrative to go back and read the first novel of a highly successful novelist. What is it that they learned over the subsequent years and multiple forays on the bestseller list? In Nelson DeMille's case, he started immediately with a suspense thriller that would be considered impressive even if written by a veteran novelist. Written in 1978, BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON resounds with today's headlines. A peace mission is flying to New York in which a treaty is to be negotiated between the Palestinians and the Israelis. High-ranking dignitaries are flying on two Concorde jets from Tel Aviv. What they do not know is that in the tail of the planes are explosives placed over a year ago as the planes were being built. Rish, a terrorist approaches the planes with his jet and threatens to blow them up unless they follow him to an unknown destination. What ensues is a standoff in the Babylonian desert between the Arab terrorists and the Israeli diplomatic team, which includes members of the military and Israeli security force.Nelson DeMille's first effort is a fast paced and extremely clever tale that is in some respects surprisingly claustrophobic. Almost the entire book occurs in this Babylonian desert region. The book can be divided into prebattle, battle and post battle. It is obvious that Nelson DeMille was stretching the simplistic plot in an effort to bulk up the book. However, the pacing is relentless and the book can almost be consumed in one lengthy sitting. The author revealed almost twenty-five years ago that he could write a competent thriller and has perfected that task over the ensuing decades. A wonderful first effort.

Big Oak Wisconsin is very, very cold-especially in November. Deer hunting season fills the woods with the sound of rifle fire. Ann Ranson, a local resident, is shocked when her dogs bring home the bloody remains of a human foot. The case falls on the shoulders of the new sheriff, Lark Swenson. He is teamed up with state police detective, Lacey Smith. They soon discover a possible serial killer on the loose. To get to the bottom of the case, they must battle the extreme temperatures, the unruly drunken locals and their own budding relationship.The brutal Wisconsin winter plays a major role in this very effective debut novel. The weather is a constant threat and one that the characters must always deal with. Rarely is the locale so carefully constructed that the reader is seized by the sense of realism. Characters are also infused with realism. Lark and Lacey's relationship is actually the central focus of this story. At times, their relationship completely takes over everything else. This is the major problem with the book if it is to be judged as a mystery. However, Ms. Greenlief has done such a superior job in creating such a sympathetic duo, that many a reader will not be bothered by this. The solution is a bit contrived but it works. I expect COLD HUNTER'S MOON to be the beginning of a highly regarded mystery series.

Thomas Perry has written some modern classic suspense novels such as the Edgar Award winning THE BUTCHER'S BOY. He has created some interesting and strong female protagonists. His latest effort, NIGHTLIFE, features again some very strong female protagonists- one a serial killer and the other the cop pursuing her.Hugo Poole is a major crime figure living in LA. When a cousin of his is found murdered in his Oregon home, Poole hires retired detective Joe Pitt to find his cousin's killer. Catherine Hobbes is the Portland homicide detective assigned to the case. As Catherine looks into the killing, she discovers that the killer is a female who has established a relationship with her victim. In fact, the killer is a woman of many identities who has made a habit of dating then killing men. Catherine publicly begins to pursue the killer. Unfortunately, the killer begins to feel boxed in by Catherine and decides to murder her pursuer.Thomas Perry knows how to weave a compelling tale. Unfortunately, in this latest work, he lacked a certain focus. The plot meandered and quite often his story would wander off on tangents that might lead a reader to wonder about the editing. For example, he describes a minor character with great care and detail over the span of several pages only to kill them off ten pages later. The ending comes so suddenly with virtually no denouement that the reader might be left scratching their head. This is not Thomas Perry's best effort. I would recommend some of his earlier works such as PURSUIT or DEAD AIM which were just republished in attractive trade paperbacks.

Ben Truman is a police chief of a small town in Maine. A college graduate, Ben had high hopes of being a history professor but was drawn back to his hometown to care for his mother suffering from Altzheimer's. Now, as police chief, he performs the same tasks his overbearing father did years before. Ben's world is shattered, in a sense, when the body of a murdered man is found in a remote cabin by the lake. The investigation brings in the feds and involves the Boston Police in that the victim was a district attorney in Boston. Ben feels compelled to help in the investigation especially when through a few strange twists, he finds himself one of the suspects. His search takes him into the grittier sections of Boston and, of course, personal danger to himself .MISSION FLATS is one of the most compelling character rich debut crime novels of the year. William Landay is a former assistant DA who has now turned to writing full time. Lucky us! This is a novel that will be highly praised and should be in line for all the major awards. It is beautifully written with descriptions that evoke the setting flawlessly. Characters such as Ben Truman are rendered with such care that the reader will feel they truly exist. The supporting cast are rendered with equal attention to detail. William Landay has attempted to write a literary mystery and in that he succeeds handily. When talk is of transcending the genre, MISSION FLATS should come to mind. It is a lengthy work but readers will not mind in that no words are wasted in the details. This is easily one of the best novels of the year and one worth seeking out.

Perhaps we expect more out of authors so highly acclaimed internationally with resultant wealth and fame based on their writing. Tom Clancy has written two clunkers in a row. In fact, the current work is quite incomplete.A secret organization called "the campus" has been set up outside of Washington D.C. Whose function is to assassinate political figures all over the world. Recruited into this covert organization is a couple of brothers Dominic Caruso, rookie FBI agent and his brother, Brian, a Marine captain. The third one is their cousin, Jack Ryan Jr., son of the US President (without his father's knowledge). The first part of this book concerns the recruitment of these three alternating with the gradual exposure of a terrorist plot in the US. The second part of the book concerns the work of the agents in hunting down and killing the culprits of the plot.The strength of a Clancy novel is the realism of the plots. After all, in a previous novel Clancy used a commercial aircraft as a missle into government buildings. Hopefully, he is wrong in the type of terrorism used in this book. However, in his quest for realism, he goes into way too much detail sacrificing pacing and suspense of a typical thriller novel. When the terrorist plot is finally revealed and carried out it is almost anticlimactic. The bottom line, a Clancy novel that simply doesn't thrill.

In the Cambridgeshire Fens, a car is pulled from the frozen river. In the trunk is a man's body. Philip Dryden, reporter for a local weekly newspaper, investigates the story. Things get a bit more exciting when another body is found on the roof of the Ely Cathedral adjacent to a stone gargoyle. This body is felt to be decades old. Is there a connection between the two deaths? The answer, unfortunately might very well prove dangerous to Dryden.THE WATER CLOCK is a very well written but a very ordinary British crime novel. In spite of some very well done characterizations, the plot was simply uninteresting. The use of stock devices such as the villian holding a gun on the hero at the end while all is divulged did not help elevate this book much beyond average. This is a surprising nomination for the Creasey Award.

Brian McNulty is a bartender on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He befriends a young woman who is strikingly beautiful, yet, highly promiscuous. He fears for her, yet, he is powerless to stop her dangerous lifestyle until she turns up dead. He takes it upon himself to find out who killed her, after the police arrest the wrong man. Through his investigation we meet a whole host of characters any of whom could have been the murderer.Cornelius Lehane can write very very well. This becomes almost immediately apparent once starting this debut novel. Characters are richly portrayed as is the NYC locale. There is a strong sense of realism to the life of McNulty. However, the author is much less skilled in the art of storytelling. For most of the book, as we meet character after character, there is little plot progression. A pitfall of so many novelists is they forget that above all else they should have a compelling story to tell. Otherwise it is hard to call the book a complete success. The bottom line: well written but dull.

Selena Keller decides to apply for employment with the CIA simply because she is bored. Much to her surprise she is contacted, asked to undergo the required testing and is entered as a new recruit. So starts the journey from the preliminaries to the Farm training facility. Her story includes an unlikely romance and it is this that much of the tale revolves around. The real mystery is - will Selena make it to full agent status?On the surface this debut novel appears to be a thriller or a primer on the CIA. However, it is actually a very well written tale of a recruit just trying to survive the training while maintaining some control over her life. This will appeal primarily to those who enjoy romantic fiction. Not my type of book but I could appreciate the fine writing.

There is a certain common format in the writing of a British police procedural novel. The main protagonist, whether he is a chief inspector or detective inspector, are all complex creations full of angst with a whole host of personal issues. Over the course of a series these issues will be confronted and hopefully resolved. The murder or crime is almost peripheral to the characters. The reader is drawn in by these very realistically portrayed characters and can't wait to visit with them again. After all, it is not the crime the reader recalls, it is usually whether the main protagonist stopped drinking or left his wife that is most pressing. The whole host of supporting and minor characters, as well as the locale, give these books their full richness. Examples include the superb books of Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson, Reginald Hill, Elizabeth George, Stephen Booth or the historical novels of Charles Todd. Add to these highly regarded authors the South African writer, Deon Meyer, who writes very much in the vein of the contemporary British police procedural.Captain Mat Joubert of Capetown, South Africa, has several problems he must solve. First of all, there is a polite bandit holding up the Premier Banks. He always compliments the bank clerks as he is robs them. Second, and more pressing, is the seemingly random murders of various men in town -- all killed by an old German handgun. On top of this, Joubert must cope with the recent loss of his wife, Lara, and his new boss who wants Joubert to straighten himself out or look for another job.DEAD BEFORE DYING is a very impressive work because the characters are so carefully and realistically created. But do not pick up this book if you are expecting a fast read. It is not a thriller. It is, rather, a book to be read slowly and savored. The plot is complex enough to keep the readers wondering until the very end. The locale is somewhat sketchily detailed, but the richly portrayed characters easily make up for that. Interestingly, the book is translated from the Afrikaans language. I met Deon and he speaks perfect English! Go figure. DEAD BEFORE DYING is the third of Meyer's works to be published in the U.S. This is a strongly recommended work.

Robert Crais has been writing solid mystery fiction for almost twenty years. He came onto the scene in 1987 with THE MONKEY'S RAINCOAT introducing his wisecracking LA private eye, Elvis Cole, and his strong silent sidekick, Joe Pike. In the 1990s, it seemed as if every other book published as mystery fiction included the wisecracking PI. The quality of these PI books and series varied, yet, Bob Crais always managed to write a superior work and remained among the very best. Crais became well known among the mystery aficionados because of this exceptional series. Fame and fortune still managed to elude him until he did what so many other writers of well regarded mystery series did- he wrote a standalone book not part of a series. Some other writers that have done this include the current best-selling authors Harlan Coben, Dennis Lehane and Michael Connolly. Bob Crais' latest, THE TWO MINUTE RULE is another standalone and should continue to advance his career quite nicely.Max Holcom is a convicted criminal. As a youth he stole cars and eventually progressed to robbing banks. His luck finally ran out as he was apprehended, convicted and served ten years in prison. Before things spun completely out of control, Max had a girlfriend whom he intended to marry and had a son who he never knew- a son who eventually became a police officer. Now, Max, on the eve prior to his release, hopes to make amends to his son and to reestablish contact with his ex-girlfriend. As he is about to step out into the world a free man, Max receives the overwhelmingly tragic news that his son was killed off duty with other police officers the night before his release. To add to his grief, Max soon discovers that his ex-girlfriend has also died several years ago. Max is insistent on discovering who is responsible for his son's death and wreak his own brand of vengeance. Yet, he is committed to turning his life around. Max manages to team up with an ex-FBI officer to get at the truth no matter what it takes.The 'two minute rule' that the title of this skillfully written suspense novel refers to is the amount of time a bank robber has to get out of the bank before an almost certain arrest. Break it and you could wind up in prison for a very long time. Max did break it and for a very good reason which gives much insight into his character. It is this superb detail to character - not only that of Max but many others including the ex-FBI agent Katherine Pollard who works with Max on the case. THE TWO MINUTE RULE is very much an investigatory novel more than a simple thriller. There are enough red herrings to render the complex plot highly difficult to solve but the pacing moves quick enough that the reader's attention should never fade. Robert Crais has been one of the stars in the mystery genre and this- his latest- is an excellent example of why that is still the case.

Jonathon King was the well deserved winner of the Edgar in 2003 for Best First Novel. The question always arises-can he again write a superior and compelling murder mystery? On evaluating his third book, SHADOW MAN, the answer is a resounding yes.Max Freeman, ex- Philadelphia PD and current PI works for his friend, Miami lawyer Billy Manchester. Freeman is asked to look into the deaths of a father and his two sons. The murder apparently occurred in the Everglades in 1923. The three worked in the construction crew and were never heard from again. Letters were found by a descendant pointing to a possible murder. It is up to Max Freeman to get to the truth. However, shadowy figures try to warn him off the investigation. His very life may be at stake.I predict that the Max Freeman series will prove to be among the most popular in the mystery genre. The writing is strong and sure. The depiction of the locale is vivid and brings a strong sense of immediacy. The character of Max is both realistic and sympathetic to the reader. Pacing is brisk and the length is perfect for a long leisurely afternoon read. Another winner by Jonathon King.

Simon Leonidovich is a courier. He transports packages anywhere in the world. The packages could contain almost any item. In this instance, he is given some computer discs which have some major inherent value. When the Swedish scientist who gives Simon the package is killed, Simon becomes suspicious that it is murder. This becomes especially evident when the owner of a major pharmaceutical company comes to pick them up. The owner lies to him repeatedly so Simon decides to look into the matter on his own. He puts not only himself in danger but his sister, who is also his business partner, along with a new girlfriend. Once Simon discovers what is happening, he realizes he must tell the authorities and save possibly millions of lives.THE COURIER is a quick easy read and entertaining thriller. The plot is a bit too long and most of the characters are stereotypic wooden creations. Pacing is the major strength and the reader will be fully entertained throughout. Recommended.

Sonchai Jitpleecheep is a cop in Bangkok. He is of mixed extraction- father was a GI in Vietnam and is now long gone. His mother was a bar girl. He and his partner are called to investigate the death of a black marine sergeant who is found dead in his car after being trapped in the vehicle with many highly poisonous cobras and a deadly python. Sonchai's partner is killed by one of the snakes while trying to get the marine out. Sonchai wants questions answered- who is the marine and why was he killed? Who killed him? The answers will not only solve the crime but, to Sonchai's mind, allow him to seek revenge over the death of his partner.BANGKOK 8 is a very long verbose book that delves into life in the dark underbelly of the city that lends its name to the title. We meet dozens of unsavory individuals as Sonchai searches for answers. The portrait of the city and its inhabitants are superbly and carefully rendered. However, as a thriller and as an entertainment, the book lacks a true pulse. The plot meanders through much explanation of Sonchai's philosophy on life. Of course these explanations slow down the pacing to practically a standstill. Getting through the book is rendered even more difficult by the sheer volume of characters the reader must keep track of.

In May of 1943, on a remote Pacific island, the American and Japanese soldiers are doing battle with each other. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is another sinister force that is causing deaths of all of them. Bodies are being discovered in horrific condition. It does not appear a human could have caused such havoc.The setting then switches to current day Boston where bodies are turning up headless and mutilated. Could there be a relationship between Boston and the Pacific island? Investigating is the detective team of Washington and Brogan. They must travel as far away as Russia and as near as a prison island in Boston to get answers. The results might very well save the human race.JINN is not reallya true mystery. It would be better to characterize this work as horror or supernatural. It is actually written in the same vein as a Dean Koontz novel. I realized early on that this book may very well be out of the genre. This, as well as the very long length (437 pages with very small type) should have been enough to put me off this book. However, the book is compulsively readable. Once started, it is impossible to put down. The story becomes increasingly implausible and the characters more stereotypic as the book progresses. However, by that time, the reader will be solidly hooked. This is far from a flawless work. It definitely goes on a couple of hundred pages more than it should have. Pacing can lag, at times. There is virtually nothing socially or politically relevant about it. And the writing, especially dialogue, can be a bit shoddy. However, Mr. Delaney is a superb storyteller. How else to explain the fact that I lasted through this very long book with so much else to read.

Daniel Silva is one of the best thriller writers currently working. His novels have it all- well fleshed out characters, exotic locations, nasty villains, and topically relevant pulse racing plots. This latest is no exception.A writer, Benjamin Stern is killed in his Munich apartment. The murder is made to look racially motivated in that Stern is Jewish. Gabriel Allon, Israeli Mossad agent and art restorer is called from his job in Venice to look into the death. It is soon discovered that the killer is an assassin for hire-- the same who might have been responsible for the death of Allon's young son and putting his wife into a comatose state. As Allon goes after the killer, he discovers that the reason Benjamin was killed is a plot that could severely discredit the Catholic religion.This is the second book published recently that deals with a secret society of the Catholic hierarchy that could place it into peril (with THE DaVINCI CODE by Dan Brown being the other). However, THE CONFESSOR is a much tighter work with the thriller elements more skillfully handled. Gabriel Allon is a compelling character with much human frailties, yet remains a mysterious loner to outsiders. Thriller writing does not get any bettor than this.

There is a sub genre of crime fiction. It is a thriller in which an otherwise ordinary individual commits an indiscretion which leads to a downward spiral and spends the rest of the book trying to extricate himself or herself. Many times these books are exceedingly well written and impossible to put down. As a whole they can be supremely entertaining. Such a book is DERAILED.Charles Shine, advertising executive married with a diabetic daughter, takes the 8:43 commuter train to his job in Manhattan each morning. One morning he is late. This, unfortunately, changes his life in that he meets a beautiful woman who actually seems interested in him. The result is quite predictable. However, a sudden complication develops which throws Charles' entire life into turmoil-- a turmoil that threatens all he knows and loves.This type of Hitchcockian stand alone thriller is one of my favorite sub genres. Other recent works written in the same vein of average man being thrown into a situation beyond his control are ABOUT THE AUTHOR by John Colapinto and TELL NO ONE by Harlan Coben. DERAILED is not a perfect work. There are some good twists- some of which are complete surprises, however, most are quite predictable. As the novel begins to wind down, the plot becomes more and more implausible. Yet it never fails to entertain. Recommended.

Jack Reacher, the hero of the Lee Child thrillers is a unique creation. He is introduced in KILLING FLOOR, the first novel, as a drifter who wanders into a town with no past and no future. He combats the forces of evil and moves on. This is pretty much the formula of the succeeding books except for THE ENEMY which takes place in 1990 when Reacher worked as an MP in the US Army. This book gives more insight into his past than any of the others. With the publication of THE HARD WAY, Lee Child takes Reacher back into familiar territory of doing good and disappearing once again.Reacher, while sitting in a cafe in lower Manhattan is approached by a man who asks him if he witnessed who got into a Mercedes parked in front of the same cafe the day before. Reacher, who never misses a detail, remembers enough information that the man requests that he speak to his boss. Edward Lane, a retired soldier who has surrounded himself with a half dozen military types. Lane tells Reacher his wife and stepdaughter have been kidnapped and the man he saw getting into the car was collecting a ransom. Given Reacher's ex-military police history, Lane asks him to help locate them. Reacher agrees to work for Lane but soon discovers that this may not have been a routine kidnapping. As Reacher investigates, he finds himself embroiled in a very complex investigation full of red herrings and surprises.Lee Child has never written a bad book and this one is no exception. Reacher is unique- a man with a little known past and no apparent future who wants for nothing except the clothes on his back and a solid pair of shoes. Hollywood has already come knocking in the form of Tom Cruise and Paramount Pictures. It is this character of Reacher, the ultimate thriller hero-strong, silent and deadly, that makes these books so compelling. That and the clever twists of the plot. Reacher is a perfect companion for your summer reading.

Two brother, Oliver and Charlie Caruso attempt to pull off the perfect crime-- transfer funds in the private bank in which they are employed from an account of a dead man to an account they create that can't be traced. It may be a very cool three million dollars. However, after the transfer, they realize they are playing a game much larger than they originally thought including the amount they stand to gain if they could pull it off. However, fast on their heels are two violent secret service agents and a relentless female PI.Brad Meltzer, after only a few novels, has already established himself as one of the best thriller novelists currently working. A characteristic of his work is the very long length of the narratives. It is almost as if he has to stretch the tale out as long as possible to bulk up the size of the book and the resultant sales. Characters are quite sympathetic yet surprisingly comic considering the far-reaching implications their actions have on their life and potential loss of freedom. There is little doubt that this novel's main purpose is to entertain and on that level it succeeds admirably.

Sometimes it is the voice of the character that is the major strength of a work. It may exceed the plot, pacing or depiction of locale as the most important characteristic of the writer. Steve Hamilton's Alex McKnight is one of the most vivid and memorable in all of the mystery genre. Steve exploded on the scene in 1998 with the Edgar award winning A COLD DAY IN PARADISE. Since that time he has written a total of four other books with Alex McKnight as the main protagonist- all superior reads and among the best the genre has to offer.ICE RUN starts out easy enough. A snow storm is coming to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Alex wants to meet his girlfriend, Natalie Raynaud, a Canadian Police Officer, in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan- about a two and a half hour drive from his home in Paradise. When he shows up a day late, an elderly gentleman is in the lobby with a suit and a fancy hat smiling and asking whether Alex likes his hat. Later, while Alex and Natalie are having dinner, the man buys them champagne and disappears out the door. The next day he turns up dead. Who was and how did he know them? These answers are considerably more complex.As good as Steve Hamilton books are, not all are perfect. ICE RUN rings true with the voice of Alex McKnight but the book has its flaws. Characters, especially the minor ones, are not well sketched and tend to come off a bit wooden. The solution is so convoluted that it can make the reader's head spin and the ending contains the detested scene of the villian holding the hero at gunpoint as we clear up some final points just prior to the predictable conclusion. Nonetheless, the plot is compelling, the locale beautifully rendered and the frigid milieu should prove refreshing reading in the hot summer months. Steve Hamilton is an excellent writer but as much as I would miss Alex McKnight, it might be time for Steve to leave him alone in Paradise for awhile and create a standalone. That will be the best way to allow Steve the wider audience he so much deserves. Well recommended.

London DS Dennis Milne is assigned to look into the death of an eighteen year old prostitute, Miriam Fox. She was found near a canal with her throat slashed. As Milne investigates, he becomes romantically interested in Carla Graham, manager of the hostel where Miriam lived. However, Carla is much more than she superficially appears to be. Of major concern to him is the ongoing investigation into a purported mob hit against three men- two of whom were custom agents. What worries Milne is that he was the hit man on the three killings. He did it for money but was told the men were hardened criminals who got what they had coming.Far from the typical British detective novel, Simon Kernick goes for true originality- a detective and a hit man. Kernick manages to pull it off admirably with superb characterizations that possess great depth and feelings. Kernick manages to achieve this by spending great care in the first half of the novel establishing these characters- especially Detective Milne, of course. The second half of the book is a violent tour de force where plot twists and surprises keep the pages turning as fast as possible. There is a great sense of control the author exhibits in plot progression and pacing. The writing style is slick. I cannot imagine he did not know exactly where the story was going. A superb debut.

Billy Nichols is considered "Mr. Boxing" through his popular sports column in the San Francisco Inquirer in 1948. He has not missed predicting the winner in a prizefight in over seventeen years. He is a celebrity in the boxing world where a mention in his column can make a big difference in the struggling career of a prizefighter. As our story begins, Billy is called to the apartment of a boxing manager, Gig Liardi, who claims to have important information. When he arrives, a red eyed Hack Escalante answers the door. Hack is the heavyweight fighter Gig handles. Hack tells Billy he killed Gig in a rage accidentally. Billy decides to bury the body with Hack's help and claim Gig left on a trip. They do so and must now contend with the police and their numerous associates in the boxing world.Billy Nichols' life is wrapped around relationships both in the boxing world and his personal life. Characters and the city of post WWII San Francisco are brought vividly to life. Many shady characters inhabit the boxing world of this era and Billy moves among them as a giant. Billy is our guide and an effective one at that. It is this sense of time and place that is the major strength of this work. Perhaps it can be said that the book is a bit too long. However, the strong sure writing cannot be denied. This is a strong recommendation.

San Francisco Inquirer boxing journalist Billy Nichols is back. This book picks up exactly where THE DISTANCE leaves off. Burney Sanders, the man accused of killing Billy's mistress and wife of boxer Hack Escalante is in jail requesting Billy's presence. He claims he was framed by some of the city's top officials. He convinces Billy to help him or else he will let all know of Billy's infidelity. As Billy searches for the truth, the reader is treated to a panoramic view of San Francisco of the 1940s.SHADOW BOXER by following so carefully on the events of THE DISTANCE actually requires the reader to read both books in order. What is most notable about this particular work is the extremely strong sense of place-- San Francisco of 1948. Events are even created to highlight certain areas of the city such as a scene at an amusement park no longer in existence. There is a dark edged noir atmosphere throughout the book. Characters are gritty and violence quite common. However, the plot is extremely difficult to navigate. Nonetheless, characters and setting easily make up for the convoluted story line. I'm not sure I will come back for more but certainly didn't regret what time I spent with Billy Nichols.

Dylan Whitman has a learning disability. He is slow and has difficulty keeping up with the other children of highly driven upper middle class suburban families the Whitmans live among. Dylan's mother, Rachel, is wracked by guilt. She is convinced that her use of a sex drug when she was younger has caused the condition. She and her husband, Martin, with a sense of desperation, seek a possible remedy-- an experimental procedure that might not only allow Dylan to equal his peers in brain power, but greatly exceed them. Unbeknownst to Rachel, other children have had this highly confidential procedure and are beginning to suffer from unforeseen side effects. It is true that IQ can be greatly increased, however, the price that the children must pay can be excessively high.Gary Braver is able to tell a suspenseful tale. However, he takes way to long to get through it. There is so much unnecessary filler that the book can be difficult to get through, at times. Character after character are introduced and do nothing to progress the tale. Rather they serve to complicate things. The basic premise of the story is somewhat idiotic and the conclusion predictable. Yet, Mr. Braver proves his ability to tell a compelling story.

In South Chicago gangs thrive. They wreak violence and death upon all that oppose them. It is within this bleak urban landscape that we meet Tony and Carlos who are attending their last year of high school. They want to pursue their dreams of leaving the ghetto and attend college. However, the gangs will not let them go in that they are witnesses to the violence that runs rampant on the streets and in the alleys. This is a chronicle of their struggle.Michael Enright is a priest who has worked in the Hispanic community in Chicago for over fifteen years. He very much succeeds in bringing to life this heart wrenching tale of two boys who just want to turn out good. Father Enright knows how to set the scene well and provide just enough conflict to keep the pages turning. This is not an overly sentimental or didactic tale but is actually a direct straightforward narrative that drives relentlessly to its inevitable conclusion. The sympathetic characters add to the pathos of this quite remarkable debut.

One of my favorite quirky PIs of recent years is stand up comic Biff Kincaid. Dan Barton, in his first novel, KILLER MATERIAL, introduced us to Biff. What made this book outstanding was the uniqueness of the character, as well as, the backstage information on the life and world of a comedian. The question I had when I originally reviewed this book in the spring of 2000 was whether Biff can remain a fresh and vital creation in subsequent volumes. The answer provided in this book is emphatically yes.After performing in a down on its heels comedy club, Flugelhorn's, Biff is underpaid $125 by the owner, Bernie Coleman. Bernie promises to pay him in two days and offers as collateral a tape he is selling to network TV about a comedy hour at a local prison which turned into a riot and a prison break. The tape exclusively reveals the start of the riot, as well as, a stabbing on the stage. However, when Biff shows up to collect his money, he finds Bernie dead in his office the victim of a stabbing. Biff is then hit in the head and when he awakens in the hospital finds a bandage on his head and the video tape gone. Biff is driven to solve the murder after finding himself among the suspects.There is, again much entertainment lore in this latest episode. At times, the pacing does flog a bit, as well as, too many characters being introduced. However, the story remains true to the formulaic PI novel and it is a very good example of how one should be written in the modern times. Strong sure writing and a unique first person character combine to make this another strong entry in this high quality series.

Attorney Jack Ruskin is torn by the anguish that his daughter was sexually assaulted by a child molester. His daughter is now institutionalized and his wife has left him. His previous life is shattered. As a means of revenge, he has become a vigilante killing child predators throughout the country. On his tail are highly accomplished FBI agents trying to stop Jack from taking the law into his own hands any further.Tim Green has written a highly suspenseful thought provoking tale as to what truly constitutes evil. Is Jack Ruskin a criminal? The reader would tend to side with the opinion that he is in fact a hero. His victims are shadowy figures with little room for sympathy as depicted by the author. The pacing becomes relentless as we follow Jack on his quest for revenge and, incidentally, in his attempt to turn his life around. Effective simple and direct episodes are used in conveying this effective and highly recommended thriller. I would definitely seek out this author's other work.

Parker is a thief. That is the basis for this very popular noir series. He goes on a different caper with each book. In most cases the plots are straightforward. Parker is approached by some unsavory characters about a job. He usually accepts. They plan the job, something goes wrong. It is corrected and Parker moves on. The books are all short and quick to the point. They are also quite insightful concerning the human character of greed and what it can do to the individual and those around them.In FLASHFIRE, our antihero is faced with the problem that somebody wants him dead. He must try to find out who and eliminate the threat. At the same time, he is asked to help out on a job stealing paintings from a remote house. As usual, things go wrong and Parker must overcome them on the way to the usual satisfying conclusion.The Parker series is one of my favorites. The books might be a bit repetitive and I wouldn't suggest reading several of them one after the other. However, they are a lot of fun. Besides the clever plots, one of the major strengths of this work are the characters. They are each so unique and full of their own personal failures, that meeting each one of them makes this series especially worthwhile. Start with any book of the series. Just start.

Kansas City trial attorney Lou Mason is asked to defend an old friend, ex-cop Wilson &quot;Blues&quot; Bluestone who is accused of murdering a local political bigwig, Jack Cullan. The police feel they have a slam dunk case and are no longer actively investigating it. Therefore, Mason must investigate it himself to set his friend free. Pursuing the truth, however, takes him into contact with some unsavory characters and Mason soon sees his own life in danger.One of the problems any mystery writer who is writing a story about an amateur detective must overcome is the justification for their character's investigation. What must also be addressed is why should their investigation prove any more successful than the police investigation? Joel Goldman accomplishes this in two ways. First, the police feel they have the murderer and stop the investigation. However, more importantly, he makes the politics such that corruption is the true culprit behind Blue's arrest and the corrupt officials shut the investigation down. Joel Goldman is a trial lawyer. With his main character also a trial lawyer, I was expecting a good solid legal thriller. A strong courtroom scene can add impact and another layer to the story. Instead we have a reasonably well told amateur detective story of no real significant worth. The story appears padded and the competently created characters are a bit too numerous. (A character list at the beginning might have helped.) This is a reasonably entertaining but highly forgettable mystery novel and, in actuality, a disappointing Edgar nominee.
