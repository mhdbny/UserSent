"Honor Untarnished". Subtitled: "A West Point Graduate's Memoir Of World War II"By General Donald V. Bennett with William R. Forstchen, Ph.D.This book was called to my attention by other Amazon reviewers. Because the main author is a general, I had avoided this book, since my experience is that generals typically write, for example, about the 123 Battalion attacking the 456 Hill, and all the numbers are numbing.The book, "Honor Untarnished", is a very personal memoir. It is the personal story of a young man, Donald Bennett, who was raised on the image of General Joshua Chamberlain (Civil War General from Maine) and other Civil War heroes. He literally worked on the railroad, and watched the rich dudes, ("high rollers"), as their train sped past his work crew, going to New York. He attended Michigan State. He had a few opportunities to be appointed to the Military Academy at West Point, New York, and after flunking out one time, (failed mathematics), he finally graduated in 1940, just in time for America's entry into the Second World War.The author begins the book with "Cadet's Prayer" and ends the book with the "Cadet's Prayer". The book's title is extracted from that prayer: "Help us to maintain the honor of the Corps untarnished".He ends the book by referring to the Cadet's Prayer.The book covers his service from North Africa to Sicily, and then to England where they waited for the D-Day invasion of France. As an advocate of mobile artillery, then Major Bennett urges the placement of M-7 artillery forces up close to the firing line where they can have the greatest impact on the battle. He believes that this will save lives.Very personally, he remembers the men who were lost. He describes the ache caused by the drowning of man who fell off the climbing nets and went straight to the bottom. The man was carrying too much weight. He describes, with a tone of regret, the destruction of a German artillery group, which was caught in the open by his M-7s. This description of the Germans wheeling their horse-drawn caissons around was an echo of his experiences in training back in the States, where his artillery was being serviced in the same way as they had done in the Civil War. He always feared being caught that way.The future general does get into less personal observations, as when, on page 299, he states that war with Russia was "...close, damn close" in Czechoslovakia. Scattered throughout the book, there are strategic and politic observations such as that on page 299.All in all, this book was well written and enjoyable.

"Doing Battle: The Making Of A Skeptic" By Paul FussellLittle Brown And Company, Boston. 1996.An exceedingly well written biography of an intellectual of the last half of the 20th Century. Well written, as to be expected of a person with so many degrees in English. I do not think that he likes "vocational" degrees, such as engineering degrees, but I suspect that he enjoys using modern word processors that engineers have developed. However, this well written book presents the life story of person, who appears, sometimes, as an anarchist, or perhaps a nihilist, and sometimes a hypocrite, and sometimes as a loner.For example, on page 97, he describes the members of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) as very angry young men "...who had been luxuriating in colleges." Of course, Paul Fussell had not been "luxuriating" in Pasadena where his father was building a new house while the rest of the nation was selling apples on corners during the Great Depression. While at Pasadena, he attended Pomona College, (of the Claremont Group of five colleges ... one of my daughters graduated from Scripps College), snuggled in a New England look-alike green belt in brown California. Because Paul Fussell was privileged to attend such a fancy college when most Americans did not go on to "Higher" education, the author had the opportunity to become an officer in the United States Army. From this seat of wisdom, he was able to judge the combat performance of the 29th Infantry Division, a National Guard Unit...which, in turn, prompted a reply in Joseph Balkoski's book "Beyond The Beachhead".Most of Fussell's book, "Doing Battle", deals with his career in academia. I do not think that the author was ever happy. At the beginning of his career, the author was "...condemned to an atmosphere of insignificance and ineffectiveness..." at a mere girls' school. (page 213). Interestingly enough, the comments of that famous (infamous) Senator from Wisconsin are confirmed in Fussell's book. Universities were godless places. Fussell reports that a Catholic professor was surprised to find so many atheists.Page 203: "...what a pederastic paradise for some graduate students Harvard had been." Heidelberg was more efficient than American universities. After I finished his book, I could only think of the comment I learned in the United States Navy, "My heart pumps purple panther piss for him."

"Year of Wonders", by Geraldine Brooks. Audio Cassette version read by Josephine Bailey, Books on Tape/Penguin Putnam, Inc. Book Number 5708Set in England, in1665-1666, this book recounts in vivid detail the effects of the plague on a little village whose main industry is lead mining. On one level, it is entirely too detailed account of how so many people sickened and died from the plague, spread by rodents and their fleas. On another level, it is a love story of the village minister and his wife, Eleanor. On a third level, it is a story of the achievements of the young housemaid, Anna, who becomes the central character recoding the events of the "Year of Wonders".The minister's wife, Eleanor, recognizes the intellectual ability of the recently widowed Anna, and begins to teach her reading and writing. Anna's husband had died in a lead mine cave-in. The young minister, who takes the place of the older Puritan cleric, preaches a sermon which causes the village population to quarantine themselves after they discover they are infected with plague. During this year of quarantine, Anna, the housewife, grows from a simple village girl, (who suffered the loss of husband and then her two sons), into an established mid-wife, with a knowledge of medicinal herbs, the ability to ease both child birth and the birthing of lambs, and a the ability to understand the motives of so many of her neighbors.In some ways, this book is too gory: the details of the birthing of both lambs and children are far too vivid. The details of the death of Anna's father, as punishment for cheating his neighbors when he dug the graves for the dead, are too vivid. And, the attempt to drown the newborn daughter of Lady Bradford is described too vividly. Some of this I ascribe to the ability of the reader, Josephine Bailey, whose skill in making you see and feel the scene is a wonder in itself. Ms. Bailey, the reader for the audio book, has a wide vocal range, so that you can almost hear the preacher exhorting the villagers to establish their self-imposed quarantine. I enjoyed the book as I commuted around I-495, the ring road around Boston.

"Best Mud Pie" written by Lin Quinn, and illustrated by Ronnie Rooney. Children's Press, "A Rookie Reader", Grolier, 2001.In this, her first book, Lin Quinn has a winner. She has fashioned a cute story that hangs together as "Roberto" concocts a mud pie from "... sandy dirt and sticky dirt" and other interesting ingredients, including pinecones and sticks! All these ingredients are colorfully and faithfully illustrated, showing Roberto in a star-studded outfit, along with a white dog with one black eye patch. Each cooking utensil is a different color, not just humdrum gray aluminum. Ronnie Rooney's illustrations bring the story to life. Success is in the eating, Roberto's mud pie goes over with Mom and Dad, Grandma and Grandpa. This book is a "Rookie Reader", so the last page is a word list of 56 words that the young reader gets to use.This book is nicely done and will provide many hours of reading enjoyment and learning.

"The Origins Of Christmas" by Joseph F. Kelly, Liturgical Press, Collegeville, Minnesota, 2004.This book covers exactly what the title says, "The Origins of Christmas". Professor Kelly presents the establishment of Christmas as an important feast day in the Christian Church, with both eastern and western roots. Drawing heavily on the scriptural nativity stories, found in the Gospels of St Mark and St. Luke, the author shows the roots of story of the Three Kings, then Star over Bethlehem, the Flight into Egypt and many more commonly held aspects of Christmas as the present age knows it. Using historical analysis, Dr. Kelly makes it clear that Christ was probably born between 6 B.C,. to 4 B.C., (based upon the records for the death of Herod) and that the ancient Church chose December 25th as the date for celebrating the Birth of Christ as a holy remedy to Roman extravaganzas in that month of the year. Kelly shows how Christmas and Epiphany developed as competing feast days for the Nativity of Christ in Orthodox Catholic and Roman Catholic branches of Christendom. He also devotes some little time to St. Nicholas and how that saint's feast day metamorphosed into a gift giving day in certain countries (e.g. The Netherlands).This is not, however, a book that deals with the tinsel: the origins of Christmas trees, or Christmas decorations or Christmas lights. Christmas carols are hardly mentioned, and the more modern aspects of Christmas, such Prince Albert's introduction of Christmas trees to England, are not emphasized in Kelly's book. If you want a bible-based analysis of the origins of Christmas, and how the biblical story grew into today's modern story of Christmas, then this is the book for you.

"Blood On The Sea" by Robert Sinclair Parkin. Subtitled: "American Destroyers Lost In World War II"Sarpedon Publishing, Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. 1995.The U.S. Navy lost 71 destroyers in World War II; their stories are told in this book. Some of the ships were sunk by enemy gun fire. Some of these "tin cans" were sunk by Kamikaze action. Others were lost to the all powerful sea. Each of the 71 vessels is given a short, (perhaps 3 pages on average) history.The book's general format begins each of the 71 sections with a few paragraphs on the history of the name of the destroyer. Once, it was Navy policy to name battleships after states, aircraft carriers after battles, cruisers after cities and so on. Destroyers were named after people who were famous in naval history or who had performed some act of gallantry, or good performance in the naval service. For example, the USS Blue (DD-387) was named for Rear Admiral Victor Blue (1865-1928) who had "...excellent intelligence missions in Cuba during the Spanish-American War..." and later commanded the battleship "New York... during her service ... in World War I". (Page 78).The next part of each section deals with the actions the destroyer was involved in and the cause of the sinking of that ship. In the back of the book, there is an appendix summarizing the various methods used to sink the American destroyers: naval gun fire, Kamikaze attack, explosion, storm and so on. The book lists the sinking of the destroyer in general chronological order. Interestingly, the first destroyer sunk by enemy action in World War II was the USS Reuben James (DD-245), lost on October 31, 1941, some five weeks before the dastardly Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The notes on the torpedoing of the Reuben James show that her captain, Lt. Commander H. L. Edwards, died when the ship was lost.So, each section gives a history of the ship's name, a brief listing of the actions the destroyer was involved in, how she was sunk and where she was sunk. I was intrigued by the single ship listed as "scuttled". The American naval tradition is never to scuttle a ship. The USS Stewart, (DD-224), was involved in the disastrous retreat of the American, British, Dutch and Australian navies before the onslaught of the Imperial Japanese Navy, early in the war. The USS Stewart was disabled and brought to a floating to dry-dock in Surabaya. The dry-dock collapsed , trapping the damaged vessel, so the Stewart's crew was split up amongst other ships and the trapped vessel blown up with demolition charges. The explosives did not do a complete job, and, as the author, Robert Parkin, recounts, ..."the frugal Japanese had raised the damaged destroyer, effected temporary repairs and ...(incorporated her) ... as Imperial Japanese Navy Shoaki-tei...Patrol Boat 102". Interesting story.Finally, there were those destroyers sunk by the might of the ocean, off Iceland, or on the rocks near Nova Scotia, or by that famous (infamous) typhoon in the Pacific. Navy Hymn: " Oh hear us when we cry to Thee for those in peril on the sea."The author, Parkin, has done an excellent job of gathering much information in one place. You can read the book from front to back, in more or less chronological order, or you can skip from ship to ship, depending upon your interests. All in all, this is a fine book.

"Face Off" by Nick Fauchald and illustrated by Ronnie Rooney. Sub-titled, "You Can Play Hockey". Picture Window Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2006.This book is only 24 pages long, but it contains a wealth of information about the basics of hockey. The book, itself, is not small, being some 10 inches wide by some 10 inches tall...a hard bound square book, that is nicely illustrated. Take a look at the moustache on the Referee on the book's cover.(Note on inside cover says that the illustrations were created with acrylics, so they are colorful!)The basics of the game are explained in little "windows" of remarks, bottom of every other page.Drama is injected by having the score 0-0, Seals vs. Penguins, all the way up to page 17. You'll have to get the book to see which team wins, but, at the end, both teams line up to "high-five" each other. ( Years ago, as I recall, the kids' teams would go by each other, slapping the other guy's hand and saying,, "Good game. Good Game", no matter which team won.)There is a nice little index on the last page, a bibliography of sorts and a listing for a web site that gets you to other sites on hockey. I clicked on and immediately found the hockey hall of fame. Both the writer and the illustrator have done a great job on this book.

"Doomsday Book" by Connie Willis, Audio Edition recorded by Jenney Sterlin, 2000.An excellent, prize-winning book enhanced by the talents of the reader in the Audio Version. Connie Willis is an established author who has turned her talents to common sense approach to time travel. Since I have recently received my MA in History, I am intrigued by her proposition that future historians will be "hands-on" workers, actually travelling to the era they are interested in, which requires them to develop an in-depth understanding of that time. This means that the time-travelling historian must know the language, understand the era's technology and be able to fit right in. Tall order! For example, I could not even order a soda in the 1957-1958 US South, when I was stationed there in the US Navy. My New York English was not understood in Memphis.Besides her common sense approach, Connie Willis has done some fine writing, as for example, she describes the starry night sky on Christmas Eve in 1348. I am certain that she has read Edgar Allan Poe's, "The Bells", since she uses the word, "crystalline" to echo his use in that poem. Personally, I have not seen the word "crystalline" used outside of Poe and electronic engineering texts on transistors.The author's irritating British bureaucrats, (e.g. Gilchrist), of the 21st Century are reflected in the rigid class system of 1348, and I wonder if Willis did this on purpose. She does develop interesting characters, more in 1348 than in the future, and it is sad to see the pouting, almost spoiled young girl, Agnes, come down with the Black Plague.The author could do a wee bit more research on the Catholic Church (which, by the way, is alive and well in 2002), as she has Kivrin saying that she "..said the Mass for the Dead" for Fr. Roche. Only an ordained priest can "say" a Mass, in 1348, or 2002, or 2054, so Kivrin might have prayed for Roche, but not by saying a Mass. Her comic relief characters, (we are running short of lavatory paper!) could be minimized, but the boy, Collin, moves things along. Her almost causal announcement of the deaths, due to flu, of Dr. (Great Aunt) Mary and the protagonist bureaucrat, Gilchrist, seemed too easy a way to eliminate them.The Audio Tape version was easier than reading the actual book, since Jenney Sterlin does such a good job of pronouncing the Old English texts, so you almost could understand the words. Especially if you had studied German. Sterlin's reading of this book helped me through many an hour on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston. Good book!

"An Unkindness of Ravens" by Ruth Rendell, Recorded Books, Inc. Version, read by Davina Porter.When a neighbor of Chief Inspector Wexford is reported missing, you just know that this is the murder required for this mystery. Sure enough, a dog sniffs out the body of Rodney Williams, shallow grave!, and Inspector Wexford begins to track down the last days of his neighbor's life.But, who would have thought? In England? There are two Mrs. Williams, each claiming not to know about the existence of the other. Bigamy! And then, incest! Rodney's two daughters, separated by miles but so alike in genes. Was Rodney Williams involved in incest with his oldest daughter, Sarah? And preparing the other daughter, Veronica, (by the second Mrs. Williams, Wendy) for a turn in the incestuous bed?Did he deserve to die? The autopsy shows that Rodney was drugged before he was stabbed to death, which leads to the secondary murder,(a necessary cover-up), of the daughter of the local pharmacist. All young ladies were members of the local feminist group. Inspector Wexford investigates this feminist group, whose logo is a raven with the head of a woman, hence the title of the book. As the Inspector uncovers more and more, it seems that Joy Williams, the first Mrs., has to be guilty. But, so much took place at the home of Wendy, the second Mrs. She had to be guilty, or they were working together ...which they deny. At the end, everything comes to nice and surprising conclusion, but you still have to wonder: all this in modern-day England? Who would have thought?The book is well read by Davina Porter, who has the capability of developing an individual, almost unique voice for the Inspector. Of course, every time the Inspector asks what a person was doing on April 15th, the night of Rodney's murder, I would say to myself that I knew exactly what I was doing. In the book, in England, the alibis were always weak. In the United States, however, the usual answer would have been a very acceptable alibi: "I was doing my income taxes!"

"Crossing The Sauer" by Charles Reis Felix.Subtitled:" A Memoir Of World War II".Burford Books, Short Hills, NJ, 2002.This is a well written personal memoir, written the way all personal memoirs should be written: little on the preliminary training, more on the actual combat experiences. This book begins with action in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in December 1994, the month of the Battle of the Bulge. The author, Charles Reis Felix, launches his story by stating that he was being "shipped" across France in the famous (infamous) boxcars known as 40 and 8s. Shipped like cattle! This iconoclastic attitude continues throughout the entire book. He relates how an Army corporal and two PFCs bilk the replacements out of American money by saying it was against regulations to have American money in France. American dollars had to be traded in for French francs. Welcome to France! Non-coms taking advantage of the new people; ("boots" as we called them in the Navy.)Trained as artillerymen, Charles Reis Felix and his friends are thrown into the turmoil of the ETO just as the Battle of the Bulge was demanding warm bodies. The author and his friends expected to be assigned to the relative safety of behind-the-lines artillery, but, as usual with the Army, the replacement artillerymen were dispatched up front with the infantry ... despite their technical expertise with the 155mm weapon. SNAFU. The author did not identify his outfit by number or name. Personally, I did not check other books to see which outfit was where in the ETO at such and such a time, as I was more interested in the personal experiences of the writer. The author mentions the Army specialized Training Program (ASTP) on page 30.For a time, Charles Felix escapes actual front line foxholes by volunteering the information that he was able to operate a radio. As a radioman, Felix worked up with certain officers, for whom he has not much good to report. He describes one officer who, with the intention of getting rid of Felix, sends him up to a dangerous front position. All this because the officer had been seen by Felix in an embarrassing position! Then there is the major, (later in the book), who likes to be first into a newly captured German town. The major would prance and dance and strut his stuff in the town square, so the recently surrendered German officials would obsequiously bow down to him. As they rapidly tracked through Germany, the major always wanted to be first into the town so that he could mince about in the part of the conquering American. This all ceased one day when a Hitler Jugend fired a Panzerfaust at the major's jeep. After that, the major was content to sit in his jeep in the middle of the convoy, protected both front and rear. There was one officer, however, who treated enlisted men, and radioman Felix, fairly well. In fact, he tells the author to go upstairs and enjoy some of the food that the officers are gobbling down. Of course, the "good" officer is quickly killed.As the war winds down, early April 1945, Felix feels sick. An old German woman looks at him and says, "Krank." (p. 183). He WAS sick. Finally, he is diagnosed as having yellow jaundice, sent to the rear, and flown on a C47 to Paris. The war ended for him.I wonder if he became sick because the U. S, Army had given him an unapproved vaccine against yellow fever. See: "Mapping Epidemics: A Historical Atlas Of Disease" by Brent Hoff, page 34. According to that reference, the unapproved Army vaccine caused thousands upon thousands of cases of yellow jaundice in American troops.

"Peekaboo Kisses" by Barney Saltzberg.Recently, I gave this book to my granddaughter, Tabitha, (22 months), who was obviously delighted. Each page brings up a different animal: kitten, puppy, sheep, duckling and then a mouse. As you say the words, "Peekaboo!", you open the flap of a page and there is the animal. Each animal has a tiny hole with the appropriate material: the "wool" for the sheep actually looks like some wool. The gray "fur" for the mouse, the last animal, is also a squeaker. An adult finger can cause the "Squeak!" every time, but Tabitha's little fingers had difficulty now and then.Finally, you come to the last page. As it is opened (with the word, "Peekaboo!", of course), there is a metallic mirror where the young reader can recognize himself. When asked, "Who is that in the book?", my granddaughter would answer with her nickname, "Tabby". So, this book is excellent for both tactile training and self-recognition, while providing entertainment for both adult and child.

"The Good German" by Joseph Kanon, Audio Tape read by Stanley Tucci.Simon & Schuster, New York, NY 2001.Although billed as murder mystery/thriller, this book is really an attempt at in-depth analysis of the actions of the United States at the end of the Second World War, when the seeds of Cold War were planted. Were Americans truly so set on reaping the dollars (marks) that they ignored the implications of a Communistic Russia? Set in the hot weather of the Potsdam Conference, July/August 1945, author J. Kanon uses his skills to develop a word picture of a bombed-out, destroyed Berlin. Kanon portrays the scenes as "you are there!" descriptions of the ruined capital city of the Third Reich, as the gun fights and car chases carry the chief character, Jake Geismar, in and out of harm's way.Jake Geismar is a realistic portrayal of the jaded correspondent, who came to Berlin during Hitler's Olympic Games. Geismar had stayed on to report the historical events, fell in love with Lena Brandt, and all this serves as the foundation for his return to a conquered Germany and the events of 1945.An over-riding theme is Geismar's continued attempt to understand how an educated and cultured Germany could have tolerated, no, more than tolerated, ...how the Germans could have joined in the crimes of the Nazis. This guilt-seeking theme slows the book, but is necessary for the final resolution when the murderer of Lt. Tully, the American Army officer, is identified.There are some logistical questions, such as how a person (Geismar) can operate an old-fashioned manual typewriter, when his arm is in a cast, and how the little German boy, Erik, (three years old) is able to understand not only his native German, but also English ... so much so that the boy is taken out of the hospital room to avoid hearing details.The reader of the audio version, Mr. Stanley Tucci, does a fine job with what we usually consider German accents, and he has fine characterization of both female and male personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors. I enjoyed this audio book as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston, in my daily commute.

"Before The Wall", by George Clare, Sub-titled, "Berlin Days, 1946-1948", Dutton, New York, October 1990.This is short, well written record of the author's service as a translator and part of the British occupying forces in Berlin, directly after the Second World War. George Clare was born as Georg Klaar in Vienna before the Nazi take-over. As a young man, he saw the "Anschluss" and the end of Austria as an independent country. His father worked to get visas for emigration to the Republic of Ireland (the Irish Free State, as Mr. Clare then termed it), but things were fouled up and the family of father, mother and son were stuck in Nazi Germany's capital, Berlin. Clare uses this stay as a basis for comparison when he returns to bombed-out Berlin, after the war.In a poignant passage, the author remarks on the lack of noise in cold and windy post-war Berlin, where once he had heard the noise and sounds of a busy city. Much of the front of the book is devoted to his memories of this bombed-out city becoming alive as he works in the British occupying forces. The details of simple breakfast, when the Berliners were going hungry (if not starving) and the details of the deference given a British uniform during a subway rush hour, mundane as it would seem, brings alive the occupation of Berlin. You had to be there to write out such recollections. Clare's writing is excellent.Towards the end of the book, the author semi-analyzes Nazi Germany and its cousin state, Austria. He quotes Primo Levi in saying that the Germans were lacking the courage to speak out against the concentration camps. Clare speaks of Goethe and Schiller strolling the woods where "... the SS implanted the hell it called Buchenwald". (p. 275). Clare doubts that A. Hitler, in 1928, when he was dictating "Mein Kampf", "..could have had the Final Solution in his conscious mind", (p. 277) but, clearly, from the paragraphs just preceding, Clare shows, by recounting Hitler's acquiescence to the killing of 380 Jews, that Hitler knew what was happening. Read the book just for this section alone.This is an excellent book, well written and a worthy personal story that documents the history of the few years between the end of the war and the building of wall.

"11 Days In December" by Stanley WeintraubSubtitled: "Christmas At The Bulge, 1944"New American Library, Penguin Books, September 2007.This concise little book (only 201 pages long) is a written collage (if that is possible) of many experiences of what has gone down in American history as "The Battle of the Bulge". The prodigious author, Stanley Weintraub, has collected the records of the recollections of many people, ranging from President Roosevelt down to the soldier in the field. The central theme of all these disparate individual records is the eleven day period in 1944 from December 16th through December 26th.The book begins with a bet between General Eisenhower and British Field Marshall Montgomery that the war would be over by Christmas 1944. Adolf Hitler gave orders for an offensive in the west that would cause Eisenhower to lose his bet, extend the war well beyond Christmas and enter history as the "Bulge". For some portion of the front of the book, I felt that the author was so "pro" Montgomery, that I went on the internet to see if Stanley Weintraub was actually British. He is not.This book, "11 Days In December", is not just a collection of numbered Army units moving here and there in Belgium, although, the author does tell you, that such-and-such a unit moved to a town; as an example, that the 101st Airborne was moved, by trucks, to Bastogne. In fact, Weintraub has some three to four pages in the index dealing with numbered American, British and German units. If you would like a book that describes where the different divisions, regiments, headquarters, etc., were located, I would recommend "The Battle Of The Bulge" by John Toland (1966).Of greater importance is the fact that the author brings together many recollections of different kinds of people. For example, there are the reminisces of movie stars David Niven and Marlene Dietrich, which are capped by the reported experiences of the famous writer, Ernest Hemingway. Of course, the author includes the famous response of General Anthony McAuliffe when he was asked by the Germans to surrender Bastogne. "Nuts!" On a more serious note, Stanley Weintraub records, pages 100-101, that President F.D. Roosevelt asked Secretary of War Stimson and General Leslie Groves if the A-bomb would be ready to use on the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The bomb was not read and Weintraub writes, "Despite later racist allegations, the atomic bomb was not being withheld for use against Japan".The book ends with the relief of Bastogne, on 26 December 1944, when General Patton's Fourth Armored Division reached that Belgian town. By the way, in the Church's calendar, December 26th has long been St. Stephen's Day; see, for example, "Good King Wenceslas" by John M. Neale and Tim Ladwig, 2005.

Never Were Men So Brave by Susan Provost Beller, 1998. This is a short book, (98 pages) intended for a younger audience, while providing a well-written and very complete history of this famous unit. Any person of Irish descent would be happy to own this book. Susan Beller records the glory garnered by the Irish Brigade in some of the most decisive and heaviest battles in the Civil War. Ms. Beller addresses the proven bravery displayed by the actions of the Irish Brigade, (made up of the 69th New York, 63rd NY, 88th NY and the 29th Massachusetts) at decisive battles, and she gives vivid descriptions of the actions of the Brigade through some important characters such as General Thomas Meagher (pronounced MAAAHer). For example, at the bloodiest single day in American history, September 17th 1862, Susan Beller not only tells the story of the vital contribution of the Irish Brigade at the &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;, but tells how, when they ran out of ammunition, the Irish Brigade &quot;right-shouldered arms&quot; and marched away in good order from the enemy. She also describes how shaken General Meagher was when his horse was shot and subsequently fell on the General. In this brief book, Ms. Beller provides a complete synopsis of the life of the Irish rebel, Meagher, from his early days in Ireland to his exile in Australia and finally his escape and settlement in America. She also describes important historical events, such as the famous &quot;general absolution&quot; given by Chaplain William Corby. Either one of these individuals would make a fine central character in a movie about the &quot;Irish Brigade&quot;; .... The Irish Brigade, as Ms Beller relates, was involved in some of the most important Civil War battles, and were so effective that it caused Confederate General Robert E. Lee to state, &quot;Never were men so brave&quot;, from which the author draws her title. Perhaps Mel Gibson might consider such a movie

"Air War Against Hitler's Germany" by Stephen W. Sears.Simon & Schuster, New York, 1964 & 2004.The famous author, Stephen W. Sears ("Landscape Turned Red", 2003), has produced a concise history of the air war against Nazi Germany. The author's emphasis is on the USAAF Eighth Air Force, which flew out of England against the Nazi Occupied continent. The very first chapter, "Mission Number 52", recounts the first real mission that the Eighth Air force had against Nazi Germany: the bombing of the Focke Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen, April 17 1943. From then on, the author retraces the history of air war, how the RAF took over the night while the USAAF took on daylight "precision" bombing. The book builds up to the build-up of thousand aircraft raids, the fire storms in cities such as Hamburg and the need for fighter escort for the daylight American attacks.The author likes (in my humble opinion) the B17 Flying Fortress more than the less "pretty" B24 Liberator, and he provides much detail about the development and general workings of the B17, how the aircraft is started and taken off from an airfield, the B17 ability to fight off fighters, and the ability of the B17 aircraft to carry bomb load. Having said this, I point out one of the most interesting chapters is Chapter 4, (page 45), entitled "Target: Ploesti". The raid on Ploesti was flown by B24 Liberators (for a single book that addresses the Ploesti raid, see, "Into The Fire: Ploesti" by Duane Schultz).The importance of fighter escort for the bombers is presented in Chapter 6, "Little Friends"; this chapter is a concise summary of the impact of P51 Mustang and its ability to prevent the German Luftwaffe from interfering with the American Air Force's bombing of Nazi Germany. In fact, this small book (only 124 pages) is a concise summary of the air war in Europe, the pros and cons of the bomber war and the highlights of the actual events. The paper back that I borrowed from the library was profusely illustrated with black & white photos of the B17 in action, the insides of the bomber itself and action-torn aircraft.

"Christmas Numbers" by Sonja Lamut. Sub-titled, "Turn And Learn" Grosset and Dunlap, 2000.Each page has a number wheel that turns. If you line up the correct number in the slot, something special appears. For example on the very first page, devoted to the number one, if you turn the wheel so that "1" appears, a bight golden angel is placed on top of the Christmas tree. The numbers run from 1 to 10. On the page for the number eight, as you turn the wheel to "8", cute brown reindeer come into view.All eight reindeer. Pulling Santa's sleigh! Then, I would ask my grandchildren to name the reindeer: "Dasher and Dancer" and so on.So, this book is a multi-faceted clever learning opportunity, as the children see both the written number and the letters which name the number. If you line up the wheel correctly on a page, the wheel is not aligned correctly on the back page. Thus, page 1 shows you the angel on the top of the tree, but its flip side, page two, is not aligned to place the orange carrot noses on the two (2) snowmen. Clever book!

Ann Carey has expended a great deal of effort in writing a book that is a fair history of the "unraveling of women's religious communities" in the United States. Her attempts at fairness leads her to use "change oriented" in place of 'liberal" and "traditonal" in place of "conservative". (p. 9). Further, Ann Carey does not describe as a catastrophe (as I would!) the "88% drop in just 30 years" of the number of teaching sisters in Catholic Schools, nor does she attribute it to a change in vocation from "selflessnes: to selfishness", but she does quote, "Many sisters flet that their time would be better spent working with adults or children who were not enrolled in Catholic schools". (p. 33) The women's religious institutes "...lost their corporate identity" when they opted for "...occupational diversity". (p. 167) In another example of understatement, Ms Carey wonders if these institutes could be taxed on their profits. Selling of convents bought by the donations of the laity, competing with the laity in the work forces, not wearing habits despite the express wishes of the Pope and a collection of other incidents are recorded. Finally, Ms. Carey writes a prescription for dealing with Religious who are "procceding down the path of self-destruciton": "... the best way to deal with these sisters is simply to allow them and their institutes to die out quietly..." p. 324. I purchsed this book... for use in my MA Thesis in History, and Ms. Carey has filled a large hole in recent history, which is so often writen about the bishops, presidents and large scale events, rather than how these events affect the daily routine of the sisters and of the laity. In rejecting their vows, in not wearing their habits, in competing in the work force and in the political arena, the "new nuns" have become just like the rest of the lay people. The "new nuns" are off their pedestals and are no better, and perhaps worse, than the remainder of the laity. Ann Carey's book, "Sisters in Criisis", goes a long way towards explaining what happened and how it happened. I would recommend it to both the general reader and to the Historian.John Peter Rooney, Plymouth, Massachusetts (For the record,I have had sixteen years of Catholic education, from grammar school through the only Catholic Engineering college in NYC.)

&#65533;The Wailing Wind&#65533; by Tony Hillerman, Copyright 2002, Harper Audio Books, 4 Cassettes, read by George Guidall.Tony Hillerman has reached a new pinnacle in his writing, as he deals with three distinct protagonists in this murder mystery. There is the &#65533;old hand&#65533;, the legendary Lieutant Leaphorn (sort of retired), the up and coming middle manager in Jim Chee and the &#65533;rookie&#65533; in Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Each of them plays a significant part in the solving of the mystery of the missing wife, Linda Denton.The central mystery, however, is the missing &#65533;Golden Calf&#65533; mine, sought for years by the gruff and somewhat eccentric millionaire, Wiley Denton. The book opens with Officer Manuelito discovering a dead body in the cab of a pick-up truck. It is obvious that the murder did not occur at the truck&#65533;s location, and Officer Bernadette is in trouble with the FBI (it is a new agent this time) for disturbing the crime scene. Manuelito is &#65533;suspended&#65533; and she spends that time tracking down the place where the crime actually took place ... which is probably the location of the &#65533;Golden Calf&#65533;.Tony Hillerman has all three characters contributing to the solution of the murder, the &#65533;Golden Calf&#65533; and to the discovery of the missing wife, Linda Denton. Early on, you get an inkling of what happened to Mrs. Denton, and as you progress through the book, your worst fears are confirmed. But, even as you go along, you say &#65533;Oh no! Hillerman would never write that! It is too horrible.&#65533;Again, George Guidall displays excellent characterization, with his voice rising and falling as required by the wide range of characters. This book helped immensely as I commuted on I-495, the ring road around Boston.

"Algeria Hotel" by Adam Nossiter. Subtitled: "France, Memory, And The Second World War". Houghton Mifflin Company, New York 2001.Adam Nossiter is an excellent writer. In this book, he has attempted to catch the conscience of the French Nation by examining their memory of collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War. Armed with an excellent command of the French language, he spent some three years in the towns of Bordeaux, Tulle and Vichy, itself. He was at Bordeaux for the trial of Maurice Papon, who had collaborated with the Germans in the removal of French Jews from France. The author, Adam Nossiter, interviewed various people, high and low levels, about their war time experiences. He records a general reluctance of the French to discuss their roles in the war and at the Vichy government center in that tiny spa town. When the interview came to the question of the French Jews and the Vichy collaboration which permitted the Nazis to transport the Jews out of France, the people being interviewed really shut down.The author has expended a great effort on making the book great literature. His writing delves into the basic human condition in that he examines why we are willing to forget the bad times, the evil that has been done , and we bury the those memories under "good" memories. Having said that, I would like to record that the statement of Maurice Papon, on page 84, really defines the difficulties of the Historian in reconstructing the past, event the recent past. The author has written excellent literature, but Mr. Nossiter has missed the mark in writing History. After I had finished the book, I was able to quote "Mark the music" (Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice", 5.1), as to the quality of the writing, but as to the history, I struggled to recall if Maurice Papon had been convicted of collaborating, and if so, what was his sentence?The book has period photos of the certain buildings in each town. One of the most poignant was the photo of Fr. Jean Espinasse, the R.C. priest who attended the victims of the hanging in Tulle.

"Manhattan College", by Brother J. Stephen, former President of Manhattan College. The Newcomen Society, New York 1978.This is a very short and concise monograph on the history of Manhattan College, with an emphasis on the School of Business. Founded in 1853 in downtown New York City by the French Christian Brothers, the College moved to its present location in about 1923. Brother J. Stephen, FSC, was President when I attend the Engineering School (1961-1965), and the good brother has written a very concise and short (20 pages) history. This book is hard to acquire, and I had to borrow a copy from Salem State College. On page 11 there are two interesting pictures of the College before and after the move to Riverdale. To sum up: this is a good, short history .

Thorough History of Protestant Bible in English in the United States. "In Discordance with the Scriptures" by Peter J. Thuesen, sub-titled "American Protestant Battles Over Translating The Bible". Oxford University Press, 1999.This book presents a history of the revisions of the English translations of the Bible, Old and New Testaments. The book has, however, another central theme: the dilemma that Protestants face when they proclaim, "Sola Scriptura", or "scripture alone", while denying the necessity of a church body to pass on the acceptability of each revision. As a papist, I rely on the Pope to say that one version or another can be printed: "imprimatur". "In Discordance with the Scriptures", points out that Protestants have no such authority. This book records the arguments of Protestants in the United States over the authority that would accept (or reject) each new English translation. The old King James Version, "...deeply internalized by many Americans, and tacitly assumed to be the very Word of God, began to lose its unchallenged cultural hegemony". Page 42. It has always been a wonder to me that Protestants, who effectively demand the separation of church and state, tolerate a Bible with a King's name on it: a bible authorized by an alien king (James was a Scot, you know).The author, Dr. Peter J. Thuesen, spends a good portion of the first two chapters on the influence that the Tyndale Bible had on the foundation of the translations of the Hebrew and Greek versions into English. Tyndale's work predates the King James Version (as does the Catholic English Bible, the Douay-Rheims version). Dr. Thuesen is ecumenical enough to mention the encyclical of Pope Pius XII, "Divino Afflante Spiritu" (Page 80), which encouraged Catholic scholarship in biblical matters in the late 1950s.The book records the difficulties that different Protestant sects or denominations had with the translations that affected theological matters. For example, Isaiah 7:14, was given as child born to at "virgin" as a child born to a "young woman". Dr. Thuesen reaches to John Calvin and into the New Testament accounts of the Virgin Birth (Matthew 1:23) to defend the propriety of the literally correct translation of Isaiah as "young woman". The author further records that it is lamentable that in today's age a "young woman" is not synonymous with a "virgin".Interestingly enough, throughout the book, the author considers the King James Version to be somewhat lacking in accuracy, and that the new revisions, such as the Revised Standard Version, (RSV), are better translations, clarifying some poorer renditions. He does not cover, however, the Christmas story from Luke, which I remember, as a young boy, noting that that Catholic version was "Peace on earth to men of good will", while the English King James version stated, "Peace on earth, good will to men". Big difference! Today, we have, "..Peace on earth to those on whom His favor rests". This brings up style. I wish that Dr. Thuesen had addressed style variations more completely. For example, again using Luke's account of Christmas, "A decree went forth from Caesar Augustus that the whole world was to be censored." is probably not acceptable in this politically correct, democratic world where emperors and dictators have been replaced by the democracy of the people. I would have like to see what Dr. Thuesen could have done with the changes in bible translations as the political scene in the world has changed.As a practicing Christian (Roman Catholic, but still a Christian), I wanted the book to cover more on the ecumenically acceptable translations of the Bible. The book's last chapter, "Epilogue" ended too soon for me, and I would recommend that future editions expand to consider Protestant/Catholic efforts on translations. Further, there is a need for a history or consideration of translations into other common languages. For example, a Seventh Day Adventist, who knocked on my door, became angry when I showed him that Luther's translation called "Exodus", "The First Book of Moses". In all, this book, by Peter J. Thuesen, is well written by a literate man, who attempts to present all sides fairly.

"Secular Saints" by Joan Carroll Cruz, Tan Books and Publishers, Rockford, Illinois, 1989Joan Carroll Cruz has done it again! After much work, the author has collected in one book a brief but essential biography of each of "250 Canonized and Beatified Lay Men, Women and Children". These saints, so listed, do not include any priests, nuns or monks. There are no popes. The author's stated goal was to write a book about lay people who achieved sanctity, in order to inspire today's lay people. In so doing, Ms Cruz has provided a compilation of little-known saints of the Catholic Church. The 250 persons are listed alphabetically, begining with St. Adalbald of Ostrevant (d. 650) and ending with St. Zita (1218-1278). Even though I was educated in Catholic schools, from grammar school through college, I have to admit that I did not recognize most of the individuals listed. In itself, this is a good reason for most of us to buy this book. Many of us will recognize St. Dominic Savio (1842-1857), who was recently canonized, the English king, St. Edward the Confessor (d. 1066), and, of course, the English Statesman, St. Thomas More (1478-1453). But what about Zdislava Berka of the former Czechoslovakia? Or St. Lufthild (d. c. 850).Joan Cruz has complied a collection of mini-biographies of lay saints; this book is interesting and informative. The 250 people listed represent many different nationalities, and, time wise, from the early beginnings of the church up to the present, (for example Blessed Marcel Callo (1921-1945), a Frenchman who died in a Nazi concentration camp). This book is highly recommended as a worthwhile reference work.

"The Leopard And The Cliff" by Wallace Breem. Subtitled: "A Novel Of The North West Frontier". St. Martin's Press, New York 1978.Wallace Breem, who died in 1990, once served in the Indian Army. When India and Pakistan were portioned in 1947, Breem had to return home to England, where he wrote a few books and worked in the "Inner Temple" in London. This employment led to the book, "A Sketch of the Inner Temple Library", about that law library.I believe that the book, "The Leopard And The Cliff", had some autobiographical aspects to it, particularly in the retrospective ruminations of the main character, "Seneman sahib" = Sandeman. This character, Sandeman, looks back over his life and his time in what was basically a backwater posting, when many of the officers have just returned from the great slaughter that was World War I. It is 1919 and the various sections of the different tribes, the Wazirs and the Mahsuds, are agitating to regurgitate the British army that is lodged in the throat of Waziristan, a section of what was then Afghanistan. Sandeman has just gotten married and he is concerned for the future of his soon-to-be born child. "Photographs: His company at Sandhurst, various regimental groups, polo, shooting and hockey teams ..." they all would have to be left behind as the troops retreat to safety. Class status, which means so much to the British, limited Sandeman's future in the provincial army, and as he ruminates, he is thrust into command of his troops who remain after desertion, treachery and "passive" mutiny.Most of the book is then devoted to the retreat of the troops through the mountainous and dry land of Waziristan, where his main concern is obtaining water for the men and the animals. One by one, the British officers are killed, despite the best efforts of Sandeman and his excellent marksmanship. Page by page, you expect the disastrous end of the retreat, but there is always too much of the book remaining. For example, in one place the entire force appears to be trapped and the mutinous soldiers and local tribesmen appear ready to surround them. THEN!, the nascent RAF appears, and the enemy forces are treated to rain of bombs and to strafing. Recall that this is supposed to be 1919.The retreat of Sandeman with his loyal troops, is quite similar to the retreat of the Marines in Korea, during the Chosin Campaign. See "The Marines Of Autumn" by James Brady, St. Martin's, 2001. In Brady's novel, the main character, Marine officer Thomas Verity, dies just as the Marines reach safety. In Breem's novel, the chief character, Sandeman, also dies just as his forces safety.One thing that I did not like about Breem's work was his almost constant insertion of Pashtu and Waziri-Pashtu words into the text. I do not think that "exotic" words added to the story. Four pages of glossary were at the back of the book (pages 283-286), but my enjoyment of the novel was interrupted every time I had to refer to the back of the book to determine what a strange word meant in English.

"The Boys' Crusade" by Paul Fussell. Sub-titled, " the American Infantry In Northwestern Europe, 1944-1945." The Modern Library, New York 2003.The Picture on the dust jacket tells it all: there is a very young face, topped by a helmet, in the center of the page. He is looking directly at you, and, hauntingly, you wonder if he survived. Paul Fussell has written subjects as diverse as "English Augustan Poetry" and travelogues, but his main contribution has been books on modern war. In this, his latest work, he emphasizes the youth of the Americans thrown into the "Second Front" with the June 6th 1944 Normandy invasion.The author's emphasis, however, is not on the bravery and achievements of the American Army in the European Theater of Operations, but rather, on the mistakes made. For example, the author deals with the bloody full frontal assault on Omaha Beach, the horrors in the Huertgen Forest and the incorrect bombing in Operation Cobra. All of these operations killed the young Americans pouring into Hitler's Fortress. He devotes an entire chapter to the replacement system, which resulted in"... infantry divisions with sterling histories ... become lamentable caricatures of what they once were and (are now) ... populated by the inadequately trained and the largely unwilling." (page 27).In summary, if you ever take a course on World War II, and the professor asks you to list the major mistakes of the American commanding officers in Europe from 1944 to 1945, all you have to do, is cite this book's title and the name of the author, Paul Fussell.

"The Marines Of Autumn" by James Brady. St. Martin's Press, New York 2000.On the very last page of this fiction book, the author, James Brady declares that the main character, Thomas Verity, was modeled after Brady's rifle company commander in the Taebeck Mountains of North Korea. That commander was Captain John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, later U. S. Senator from Rhode Island, and Secretary of the Navy.It seems to me that this novel is a character study, where the author, James Brady, presents a portrait of the ideal Marine infantry officer, with both good parts and bad parts. Captain Thomas Verity is different, if not unique, as a Marine officer because he was born and raised in China, speaks Chinese, because he has seen combat (e.g. Guadalcanal) and then, because, after the War, he had gone to college. As the Korean War begins, Verity is teaching at Georgetown University.His ability to speak Chinese was the main reason that Captain Verity was recalled to active duty, as the Marines needed someone to monitor Chinese Communist radio traffic in China just across the border from North Korea. Probably, the author has given this linguistic ability to his main character so that Captain Verity can be privy to the meetings of higher level officers who believe that the Chinese Army is coming. This permits James Brady to make comments about the U.S. high command's pig headiness about the ability of the Chinese to invade Korea to support their Communistic allies. It also allows Brady to zap General Douglas MacArthur who repeatedly denied the presence of the Chinese Army at the borders of North Korea or inside North Korea proper. It is apparent that James Brady does not care for MacArthur, for, as an example in Chapter Two, (page 22) he has one person calling MacArthur, "The Mikado himself".On a poignant note, the main character, Captain Verity, had lost his wife. Now, with the death of Captain Verity, the young daughter, Kate, will be an orphan. She asks, "And who will take me now to France to see the bridges".

"Mark Of The Grizzly" by Scott McMillion. Subtitled: "True Stories Of Recent Bear Attacks And The Hard Lessons Learned". Falcon Publishing, Helena, Montana, 1998.While checking out books at the Plymouth Public Library, I saw this book on display. On a whim, I also checked it out. I found this book to be anything but whimsical. There are 20 chapters, with at least 18 different stories of bear attacks embedded within them. The medical details are horrible. If the author, Scott McMillion, had written about automobile accidents and described the how a windshield (or some other auto part) had swept in and scalped the woman, I believe that the editor would have told him to tone it down. But slicing off the skin and underlying tissues covering the skull is only one terrible injury the author describes in this book. Long fangs crushing eye sockets. Ulna and radius being crushed in jaws. Crushing and ripping, with bloody stains and bloody clothes. And then, covering up the body, with dirt, for future reference and for lunch! Throughout all these stories, I think that Scott McMillion implies that the problem or fault rests with the human interloper.Back in 1976, (recall, the movie "Jaws" was fresh then), when I was teaching probability and reliability, I would give my students an example of reducing the probability of an event to zero: if you wanted a zero probability of shark attack, then move to Kansas where there are no oceans and no chance of shark attack. In Kansas, Shark Attack Probability tends towards zero! Right! Is that what Scott McMillion wants? Should all human beings keep out of the forests, just to avoid the bears? The bears were there first. The author recommends pepper spray to ward off bear attacks but then admits that this works only about half the time. Mr. McMillion's stories repeatedly remind us that firearms are not sufficient when the bear charges rapidly and unexpectedly. Our understanding of bear attacks appears to be as deficient as our understanding of shark attacks. So?I was born and raised in Manhattan (went to Manhattan College, too, but the College is in The Bronx). I saw polar bears at the Central Park Zoo. Never saw a grizzly. However, I did see a Liger and a Tigon, when I was young boy. I volunteered for the United States Navy, so I never lugged a back pack and weapons as we marched along (that was fifty years ago). I do not think you will ever find me walking under a forest canopy, worrying about bears snuffling along. So, Mr. McMillion, thank you for your interesting book with the insights into bear behavior.

The Innocents Within by Robert Daley: A well-written novel describing explicitly realistically the possible daily routine in occupied France during the Second World War. Robert Daley has developed convincing characters, ranging from a Protestant minister down to a French farmer, whose reactions to the occupying German forces appear to be such a credible description that the novel reads more like a personal history. Into the complex arena of occupied France, Mr. Daley pops in (literally) a shot-down American flier. (I wondered why Daley had the American pilot, David Gannon, attending Fordham University, until I looked up the author's biography and saw that R. Daley had graduated from Fordham in 1951.) Davey, the downed and wounded American pilot, has to be cared for by the stepdaughter of the minister, Andre Favert, and, as usual, one thing leads to another, and the pilot and the daughter are doing what comes naturally. Daley excels in describing naturally occurring events, as the drive in the snow to the prison, the tracks the farmer left behind when he drew the gasoline from crashed American plane, and the treatment of the farmer, his farm and his animals when the Germans discover that the farmer had helped the American airman. For example, the author has the German soldiers not just killing the pigs, but butchering them and taking away the hams. This presents the picture of a group of men destroying a farm, killing the farmer and all the while considering what they were going to do for dinner after the &quot;work&quot; was done. Daley does not completely develop the German characters, in my opinion, as the German soldiers are depicted more as grasping and thieving individuals, rather than fanatics of an army of Master-Race

&#65533;Under The Bombs&#65533; by Earl R. Beck, Sub-titled: &#65533;The German Home Front 1942-1945&#65533;, University Press of Kentucky, 1986.History Professor Earl R. Beck understands the need for an evenhanded presentation of facts and conditions, and his book, &#65533;Under The Bombs&#65533;, is very balanced presentation of the conditions that existed in the Nazi Reich in the years from 1942 to 1945. Beck neither defends nor attacks the bombing of German cities and German civilians. The Professor does not sensationalize the bombing raids on German cities, but, in a rather quiet and an almost dispassionate fashion, describes the impact of so many tons of bombs dropped on so many civilians. In so writing, Dr. Beck actually presents a cogent case against aerial bombing.This book, however, is NOT a collection of statistics about the number of bombers, the tonnage of bombs, and the quantity of casualties and the horror of war on civilians. The book is really about the German people and how they suffered during the bombing raids. Enough details are given to cover the general history of the air war against Nazi Germany, but Professor Beck emphasizes aspects that others have not. For example, he gives more coverage to the firestorm in the German city of Hamburg (see his chapter, &#65533;Bombing Achieves Holocaust&#65533;), than the more famous (infamous) firestorm in the eastern German city of Dresden (later in the war). I wonder how many people were offended by the equating of the firestorm to a holocaust? Further, Dr. Beck quietly asserts troubling facts, &#65533;Unable to &#65533;attack Germany by land, with the fighting in Italy still far away from the German borders, and&#65533; the British had only one way to bring the war home to Germany &#65533; from the air&#65533;. P. 64. Dr. Beck states that the British were &#65533;prisoners&#65533; of the weapons they possessed. On page 65, Beck relates how Britain&#65533;s Air Marshall Harris initiated the modern concept of the body count, by &#65533;&#65533;keeping account of the effects of aerial bombardment in terms of the degree of destruction &#65533;and the number of persons killed.&#65533;On the other hand, this book attempts to relate personal feelings, gleaned from countless records and interpretations of Party correspondence. For example, the Party could not tolerate church services being held for the dead in the bombed cities. Dr. Beck relates how the Nazis worked to develop a more acceptable party procedure for such funerals. The book contains many details on the life of the individuals in the Third Reich and their morale. Stalingrad was the turning point. Dr. Beck then documents how the Nazi Party attempted to control every word spoken, in fact, even the thoughts of the Germans, by swift punishment for &#65533;defeatist&#65533; actions, words or sayings. If you ever have wondered why there was not more German resistance to the Nazis, read this book. Beck&#65533;s description of the promulgation of a &#65533;Nazi Christmas&#65533; (p. 105) is particularly telling. This book is a worthwhile,well written assessment of the state of mind of the German civilians and the deterioration of that state as the War wore on.

Dog Company Six: This is an excellent book, exceedingly well written. Although presented as a novel, this work of fiction provides a thorough history of Marine Corps action in Korea, from the landings at Inchon up to the end of the war. The author, General Edwin Howard Simmons, records the Marines' struggles, up and down the peninsula, north and south, through the eyes of Captain Bayard, the commanding officer of Dog Company. General Simmons writes with an excellent command of the English language, which he employs to describe the foul-ups and successes of the Marines in Korea. This book is definitely written from the point of view of the &quot;grunt&quot; in the mud (or snow). The highest rank for a character in the book is a light colonel. I would highly recommend this book.

"Stars And Swastikas" by Walter Schroder. Subtitled: "The Boy Who Wore Two Uniforms". Archon Books, 1992.This is a personal memoir of a young German boy, born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, but growing up in Germany during the Second World War. During the Great Depression, the parents of Walter Schroder returned to Germany for economical reasons. So, young Walter had to adjust to using the German language every day in school and was "tagged" as an outsider because of his accent. As the Second World War wore on, Walter Schroder was fundamentally drafted in the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, which had responsibility for anti-aircraft weapons. The book begins with the end of the war and the capture of Schroder's Luftwaffe unit by British troops, with his subsequent incarceration in a British POW camp. Schroder used his ability to speak English, (even though he sounded like a "Yank"), to help himself and his fellow prisoners . Then, it was discovered that he was born in the United States, one thing leads to another, and he is set free in England, returns to the Continent where he joins the Untied States Army, and before he reaches the age of 21 years, he has served both Germany and the U.S., both "Stars And Swastikas". Excellent memoir.

"Echo Park" by Michael Connelly, Little, Brown and company, New York, 2006.I was borrowing a book on Michael Collins, the Irish patriot, when the Librarian called my attention to the latest novel by Michael Connelly. Their names were alike in their Irishness. So, I borrowed the book, "Echo Park", and I so enjoyed the novel that I thought it worthwhile to become the 129th Amazon reviewer.Michael Connelly's writing is excellent, moving smoothly and quickly along, so that the novel was a joy to read. His knowledge of police procedure is evident in this novel, and it makes you wonder if he writes for television shows such as "Law And Order". But then, you attempt to figure out the plot as you read along the pages; how can the author use the Serial Killer, who has already been captured? The obvious contempt for the "pretty boy" politician points to a deal with the Serial Killer for possible positive publicity, but there has to be more than that. I expected H. Bosch's past and present girl friend, FBI agent Rachel Walling, to be put in harm's way and to be captured by the killer, but the plot twists another way. The plot twists really make this novel interesting reading and hard to put down.I was happy that this novel was recommended to me and I am happy to be the latest reviewer to assign five stars to the book.

"Prayers And Heavenly Promises" by Joan Carroll Cruz. "Complied From Approved Sources". Tan books, 1990.This is a small book, not only because it is only 130 pages long, but also because it is only six inches by about 3 inches. The book can easily fit in a woman's purse or in a man's pocket. Ms Cruz, the author, is know for compiling lists: of Eucharistic Miracles, of Miraculous Images of Our Lord or of incorruptible bodies of saints world wide. In this little book, she has gathered a collection of prayers. Many of which the devout Catholic will immediately recognize. Some prayers will be unfamiliar, which makes this book even more valuable. Towards the back of the book she presents "Familiar Catholic Prayers", such as the "Our Father", the "Hail Mary", (based upon the Gospel of St. Luke), and the "Glory Be". Chapter 12, page 79, tells you about the promises linked to the Holy Rosary, but you will find how to pray the rosary on pages 125 and 126. Interestingly, since this book was copyrighted in 1990, the list of the Mysteries of the Rosary, (p. 125), does not include the Luminous Mysteries which were introduced by the late John Paul II in 2002.Throughout this book, Ms Cruz documents the promises associated with the different prayers. For example, on page 28, the "Miraculous Medal Prayer", Cruz records that "...that those who wear it (the Miraculous Medal) will receive great graces". The whole book follows this pattern : the prayer is given, with a brief history and then the attached promise (s) described. I found this book a great aid in increasing my simple devotions. I hope you will also.

"Antietam" by James M. McPherson. Sub-titled, " The Battle That changed The Course Of The Civil War". Oxford University Press, 2002.As so many of the 53+ reviewers have noted, this book is NOT a blow by blow account of the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in American history. Many of those friendly reviewers suggested other books which give an account of the actual battle, itself. The author, the noted Historian James M. McPherson, spent much of the front part of the book developing the political, military and international situation just prior to the Battle of Antietam. The condition of the Union was far bleaker than I had realized. President Abraham Lincoln seized on any success, even the slight and scanty success of Antietam, to promulgate his Emancipation Proclamation.But, what I would like to point out is that McPherson's book is a scathing indictment of the actions of Union General, George Brinton McClellan, (1826-1885). McClellan was certainly the most controversial of the Union generals. He ran against President Lincoln in the election of 1864. When I was working on my MA, History, at Bridgewater State, the joking comment in the Civil War class was that , after Robert E. Lee, General McClellan was the best general that the Confederacy had. If , in the modern Gulf War, a modern Army general had done one-tenth of the things that McPherson wrote about McClellan (e.g. hold back his reserve troops when needed in battle), then that modern General surely have been found guilty by a court-martial. So, if you are ever required to write a paper on the failings of McClellan, take it from this book.

"Control Systems, Safety Evaluation &amp; Reliability" by William M. Goble, Ph.D.A well-written book that presents fundamentals of reliability, probability and safety in a literate fashion. Dr. Goble, a graduate of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has put together a literate presentation of reliability, probability mathematics and the basics of safety. This single volume represents a concise and easy flowing approach to the calculation of the probability of occurrence of an event that can affect the safety of your process control plant. The book begins with basics ("Understanding Random Events") but soon has you performing Markov analyses and working on "coverage". In fact, Bill Goble's explanation of the "coverage factor", page 313, is one of the best I have seen. If an analyst follows the layout of this book, and performs all the steps, as indicated by Dr. Goble, then the final result will include a system model, identify the important or crucial failure modes, calculate the probability of the occurrence of those crucial failure modes and provide a Markov model of the entire crucial/critical part of the safety system. All of this will allow the analyst to perform the required mathematical description of the safety system, so as to meet or exceed the requirements of the IEC Standard IEC 61508. Dr. Goble uses this book as the text for an ISA course with almost the same title as the title of the book. Dr. Goble follows the book implicitly in the ISA course I attended in 1999, and I enjoyed his vitalized presentation greatly. He emphasized the need for Failure Modes And Effects Analyses so as to identify crucial/critical failure modes, and the need for the FMEA to develop the proper Markov model for the system/sub-system. The book is so well written that I do not expect the typical engineer to have many questions, but, if you want an entertaining presentation and an enjoyable classroom experience, take Dr. Goble's ISA course with this book. I highly recommend this book to not only engineers concerned with probability of safety events, but for the general reliability engineer.John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.

"American Bison" by Dale F. Lott. The author, Dale Lott, has spent much of his life, if not his entire life, observing and studying the animals commonly called "buffalo". Clearly, this excellent book is a labor of love for him. He deals with all the relationships that the bison (buffalo) have established in order to survive, ranging from microscopic bacteria up to the greatest predator, Man. Chapters are devoted to obvious relationships such as Chapter 1, "Bull to Bull and Cow to Bull", interesting in how important the sex drive is, but also how important survival is. Some unseen relationships are described in Chapter 5, "Digestion: Grass to Gas and Chips" ... who would have thought? The buffalo (bison) once roamed this North American continent in the millions, and Professor Lott (Emeritus, U. Cal., Davis), spends an entire chapter (Chapter 8) on how many buffalo there once were. He makes a stand for 30 million or so, which is about half the 60 million bison usually accepted.Throughout the book, Prof. Lott sprinkles interesting comments which grab your attention. He defines the bison as "Living according to a `fat economy'", which means, as with bears, the bison must accumulate enough food reserves in the Spring and Summer to last them through the cruel Winter. He calls this, "making fat while the sun shines." In the chapter on "Digestion", he describes the necessity of bacteria in the many stomachs of bison for the breaking down of the grasses which they eat. Then, out of the clear blue, he brings in the analogy, "It's a sobering fact that 12 or 13 percent of a bottle of ...Champagne is bacteria pee." (Page 49) These little gems are scattered throughout an otherwise serious book that tells you more than you could imagine about the American Bison. Read the book because of the subject, but then, read the book just to see how many common sayings the author has twisted to fit the subject!

"Eight Ate" by Marvin Terban. Illustrated by Giulio Maestro. Sub-titled, "A Feast of Homonym Riddles". Clarion Books, 1982.This book plays on the wealth of homonyms (words which sound alike but mean different things) in the English language. First, a question, (i.e. a riddle) is asked, and then the answer, dependent upon a homonym, is given. For example, on the back cover, the riddle is: "What do you call a smelly chicken?"Answer, playing on the homonyms: "A foul fowl!"The entire book is filled with this type of word play: the riddle, with the answer in homonyms nicely illustrated by Giulio Maestro. All of the clever use of words makes for funny reading aloud. The illustrations keep the attention of the children who are too young read, even though they may not fully understand the joke embedded in the homonyms. This book is a worthwhile addition to the library of the young reader.

"The Next Pope" by Peter Hebblethwaite, and revised and update by Margaret Hebblethwaite.The latest consistory, March 2001, has made this book obsolete before the book is even a year old! In March, Pope John Paul II, the old nemesis of the Hebblethwaites, appointed 37 new cardinals to the College of Cardinals. The College is now the most diverse in the almost 2000 years history of the Church. In adding these new members, John Paul has broken down the careful foundations for the analyses of the book, "The Next Pope" and made much of that analysis obsolete. For example, the addition of 37 new members increased the number of cardinals eligible to vote for the next pope to 128, eight more than the maximum of 120. When questioned about this higher number, John Paul II replied, laconically, "Yes, I know."The 37 new members change much of the background for chapter 7 in the book. The Pope appointed many cardinals from Spanish-speaking countries that were once evangelized by Old Spain. This Spanish-speaking Bloc is larger than the Italian Bloc. In the next conclave (after John Paul dies), if the Spanish-speaking Bloc and the Italian Bloc work together, we may see the election of a Spanish-speaker to pope. Further, that pope may be the first from the New World. If, however, these two blocs cannot agree, the conclave may be long and weary. This might present an opportunity for the 12 cardinals from the United States and the eight from Germany to propose their own candidate, and that might be Cardinal Ratzinger, who is even more conservative than John Paul II. Or, they may settle on the new Cardinal Avery Dulles, a liberal theology teacher at Fordham University, NYC, who is too old to vote in the conclave. What a difference the new members make!There are new cardinals from Asia, who might unite with other cardinals from Asia and Oceania to form an Asia/Oceania bloc to draw attention to that remote corner of the world. And, there are now two (!) cardinals from Ireland, doubling the chances of electing the first Irish pope, next time. In Chapter 7, Hebblethwaite attempted to identify the "Not-Yet Cardinals", as he called them. Of the eight possibles, he was right on four and the other four did not make it. That is only 50%, and I believe a competent reporter at the New York Times or the Washington Post could do as well with background research available at those papers. So much for the "insight ` of Hebblethwaite.Although the book was made obsolete and redundant by the latest appointment of cardinals, the book IS, however, a concise history of recent conclaves. Further, in the paper back format, it is easy to carry on an airplane and just about the right size for a cross-continent flight. The book is well written: there was only one error I could discover, on page 80, where &quot;Poland was carved up between three powerful neighbors...&quot;; in English, things are carved up between two neighbors or &quot;among three neighbors&quot;. Among &amp; Between.

"The Beardless Warriors", by Richard Matheson, sub-titled, " A Novel of World War II". A Tom Doherty Associates Book, New York, May 2001, but first copyrighted in 1960.According to the fronts piece, this is a work of fiction based upon the experiences of the noted writer, Richard Matheson, when he was shipped as an 18-year-old replacement into the European Theater of Operations in late 1944. Matheson portrays the development of Private Hackermeyer from a stumbling, inexperienced and frightened young soldier to a competent killer, who ignores the surrendering gestures of German soldiers. He has become so proficient in shooting his M-1, that Hackermeyer automatically registers on the target, pulls the trigger and then begins to scan for more.Although written as fiction, there are two separate analyses of the wisdom of using young men as soldiers; these analyses are couched in dialogue among squad members. (Sergeant Cooley states, "I ain't running a rifle squad, ...I'm running a kindergarten.") There is also some discussion about life after death, resulting in Hackermeyer's introspection on that subject, on the death of his mother, and on life back in Brooklyn, NY.The writing is excellent and Richard Matheson vividly establishes the range of feelings among the young soldiers, ranging from absolute terror to complacent acceptance, during the various attacks and defensive actions that take place in a very short calendar time. In my opinion, Matheson has captured day to day combat better than most writers.

"Hillerman Country" by Tony Hillerman. Subtitled: "A Journey Through The Southwest".Photographs by Barney Hillerman. HarperCollins Publishers, 1991.There is much beauty in the excellent photographs in this book. There is much beauty in the excellent prose in this book. I have been a fan of Tony Hillerman's Navajo Police novels, and I like Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. So, I lean towards Tony Hillerman's writing.When I worked as an engineer, my job took me to Phoenix, Albuquerque and Sandia. Had a tour of Sandia Labs and went up the tram to Sandia Peak. My memories of the Southwest include hot concrete sidewalks, steaming asphalt parking lots and little lizards. Back in the East, we have little chipmunks running around amongst the trees. In Hillerman's Southwest, you saw tiny lizards scampering around the trees in the parking lots. My point is that most of us see only the populated centers and this Hillerman book emphasizes the lands where people are few and far between. The book is wonderful.I've written reviews on Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn/Navajo novels. I was more impressed with the writing in this book because Tony Hillerman would enter an excerpt from one of his novels as the caption for a beautiful photo that his brother, Barney Hillerman, had taken. You can look at Barney's picture and then read the caption from Tony's novel, and then say "Wow! His words do a great job of describing the scene".So, if you're a fan of the writer, buy the book for the prose. If you're a fan of Nature's beauty, get the book for Barney's photos; you'll get views that most of us never see. In either case, this book is excellent.

"Holding The Zero" by Gerald Seymour, 14 CD Audio Book read by Sean Barrett, ISIS Audio Books, 2000.Augustus Peake goes to Iraq to repay a debt of honor incurred by his grandfather, some fifty+ years ago. "Gus" is fitted out in what appears to be a haphazard fashion, and travels to Iraq to support the insurrection of Kurdish forces against their ancient enemy. A complaint by an Australian caseworker in Iraq begins an UK investigation into Augustus Peake and why he is engaged in a sniper's duel in Iraq. The investigation shows that the entire adventure was not so spontaneous as it first seems. So, on the first level, this is a very personal duel between the neophyte (but excellent marksman) Gus Peake and the head of the school for sniping in Iraq, Major Karim Aziz. When we first meet Major Aziz, he is prone on a roof, seeking an opportunity to shot (it seems) the President of Iraq, our friend Saddam. There is much introspection presented, both for Gus Peake and for Major Aziz, as both snipers consider the finality of the tools they use. The climax of the book is the sniper's duel between the two men.On a second level, this book is a fine compendium of the history of sniping. The author, Gerald Seymour, uses the necessity of explanations for the young Kurdish boy and assistant to Gus, to present the history, of modern sniping, from the American Civil War up to the present. Seymour tends to introduce characters to present points. For example, he has a rotund Russian, interested in the mineral rights to the land, (if the Kurds win), tell the story of the famous sniper's duel at the Battle of Stalingrad. The author also uses a British character, an ex-corporal, to explain to Augustus Peake how a sniper, together with carefully place land mines, can halt a column of armor. Gus does just that!On the third level, the author, Seymour, makes a telling statement against the vested interests of Americans, British, Israelis and Russians, in raising the hopes of the Kurdish people but not truly supporting them in their struggle against the despotic government of Iraq. All of these outsiders were using the Kurds as proxy fighters. At the very end of the book, the Kurds retreat back up into the mountains, which they call their only true friends.The book was well read by Sean Barrett, who has a keen ability to provide an accent to match each character. The use of "further" when "farther" was needed nettled my ears once or twice or more. When a sniper shoots over a long distance, he has shot "farther" than any one else. "Far" for distance, while "further" is used for consideration, or thought or discussion. Further, when the reporters divide up their gear to carry it all back to the car, they should have divided it "among" the three of them, not "between" the three of them. Between for two, among for three or more.

"GI Jews" by Deborah dash Moore. "How World War II Changed A Generation". Belknap Press, Harvard University, 2004.The title is catchy: "GI Jews", reminding me of the toys, called "GI Joe". My son, Sean, (now a Marine Corps veteran), played with GI Joes in the early1980s. The real theme of this book, however, is expressed in the subtitle: "How World War II Changed a Generation ". How the War changed a generation of Jews. Prior to the War, both Judaism and Catholicism had been outsiders to the American dream. As Dr. Moore says on page 10, "Judaism assumed an American legitimacy unanticipated at the start of the war. Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism were deemed to share common values that made them the religions of democracy". Further, "... (a)cceptance of the Judeo-Christian tradition in the armed forces would force Protestants to share the Christian label with Catholics and include Jews as equal partners in America". (p.10). Tis a consummation devoutly to be prayed for.In general, this book deals with the impact on individual Jews, from Jews who were exceedingly pious to men who were hardly observant Jews ... i.e. Jews in name only. The author traces, generally in chronological order, how young Jewish men became part of the American Armed Forces, were trained and then shipped to overseas assignments, both combat and non-combat. Many of the men who were subjects of this book, came from the New York City environment, (of interest to me, since I was born, raised and educated in Hell's Kitchen. I also went to high school at 161st Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx see page 60).Dietary restrictions presented a challenge to religious Jews. In the chapter, entitled, "Eating Ham For Uncle Sam", (pages 49 to 85), the author, Deborah Dash Moore, recounts how "Uncle Sam" virtually ignore the ancient dietary restrictions of Jews, and the poor fellows had to eat ham or starve. Despite the author's analysis of the new sensitivity of Protestant America, when, as an example, Tip O'Neill (1912-1994) was invited to the White House for a freshman congressman dinner (1953) with then President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the menu was steak...which tip O'Neill could not eat since it was Friday. Catholics did not eat meat on Friday. The future Speaker of the House was vocal enough to demand something other than meat, and the White House chef plopped salmon from a can onto O'Neill's plate.Another example of how things change slowly: Dr. Moore recounts how, at a USO dance in Florida , the "town girls" were happy to discover that although Walters was from Brooklyn, he was Jewish and NOT Irish Catholic. (See pages 70-71). In 1958, I was stationed at the Naval Air Technical Training Center in Memphis. I went to a USO dance in downtown Memphis. The southern Belle asked me where I was from. When I answered New York City, she asked, "Are you Jewish?" "No.", I replied, "Worse yet, I'm Catholic." The Southern Belle turned her back and walked away. In Memphis, it was impossible to get a pizza or lasagna; I expect that has changed today. By the way, in 1958, the "Colored" and "White" signs were still on the water fountains.The author includes a chapter on "Worshipping Together", which, on page 121 has the Douay Rheims version of the bible (the Catholic English version, older than the King James version in English), quoted as saving "Jews are Synagogue of Satan". I looked up the Douay version on the WEB, as the Douay English is so old that I do not have a copy in the house. The WEB does have the quotation "Jews are Synagogue of Satan" but also has the negation, "...but they are not".... So, I do not understand the protest of the Jewish chaplains, as recorded on page 121. By the way, the King James version was used to force the Irish to learn English and to stop using Irish Gaelic.This book mentions personal reminisces of the "GI Jews", but there are really not many explicit combat experiences as so many recent World War II accounts have. Becoming supersensitive, I began to enumerate how many times the author has the "Irish" protrayed as the offending or involved ethnic group. On page 67, "...a bunch of Irish kids" beat up on Minkow. Prior to the war, the only Irish he had seen were "...Irish conductors on the 167 street trolley". On page 185, POWs were picking on a Jewish POW until ".. a big Irish guy" intervened. That is enough for now. What about the other ethnic groups? Recall that we were fighting not only Germans, but also Italians.Finally, I wish that the author had spent more time on the Army Specialized Training Program (A.S.T.P.), especially the unit at CCNY. The Army Specialized Training Program (A.S.T.P.), was mentioned, ever so briefly, in passing on pages 40, 80, 87 and 125, as just some examples. Just to correct one mistake, the "USS Hornet" , CV-8 or CV-12, was an aircraft carrier, not a battleship as Dr. Moore states.

"German Boy: A Child In War" by Wolfgang W. E. SamuelWolfgang turned ten years old in February 1945, just as Soviet tanks were marching towards the town of Sagan in East Germany. (Sagan is now Zagan in Poland). The author has written an excellent book about being a boy in that time. This book is NOT about Germany's losing Pomerania, Silesia East Prussia, etc. Col. Samuel has been able to capture the memory of his feelings as a small boy as his world collapses around him. Besides the usual trials and tribulations of a boy growing up, Wolfgang had to deal with being afraid and distrustful of adults, of being the refugee outsider in close-knit German villages and being "from the big city" in these small villages. All of these things most boys do not want to be. Somehow, Col. Samuel has been able to capture the boyish feelings he had years ago and write them down in this very personal memoir.The adult Samuel was able to capture the childhood way of thinking. For example, on page 70, he writes, " I became uneasy at seeing the barrier. If they had build tank barriers, they must be expecting Russian tanks. My sense of security diminished... ." In other sections, he records his childhood reproaches of mostly his mother, and somewhat, of his father. It is as if his parents were somehow to blame for much of the difficulties he experienced. He does not, however, record any feeling of reproach for himself, as when, e.g. foolishly, he walks through a raging blizzard to go to school, even though his mother had warned him not to do so. His distrust of adults is further justified when the baker, to whom he is apprenticed, switches Wolfgang form the union-inspected room to housing in a bombed -out ruin, after the union inspector has left the premises. On the other hand, he has only good things to say about both sets of grandparents.Colonel Samuel's childhood experiences would make most of us very cynical; he has survived them to have a productive thirty year career in the United States Air force.

"Taught To Kill" by John B. Babcock. Subtitled: "An American Boy's War From The Ardennes To Berlin". Potomac Books, Inc. Dulles, Virginia, 2005.The writing in this book is excellent. Throughout the book, the author, John Babcock, WWII Veteran, uses alliteration, the rhyming of the first syllables of words, as little jewels which makes his writing sparkle. Despite the serious subject of the book, the author has made it easy and pleasing to read. And, the subject of the book is serious.Using a fifty-year old manuscript, which he had typed at the end of hostilities in Europe, he put together a genuine accounting of a "...small-town American college kid, transformed ... by government edict, into a foreign-soil combat soldier". Unlike so many other personal memoir books, Babcock has expended a great deal of energy on introspection, where his recorded observations are combined with an examination of exactly what his pains and his unit's hard work did for the war effort, in particular, and for mankind, in general.His description of the death of his "...first KIA (killed in action): Sergeant Coleman..." was particularly poignant. Sergeant Coleman's professionalism had convinced Babcock that Coleman was possibly the most invulnerable soldier in the company, and there was the sergeant with a "...chunk of his forehead ...shot away". On the other hand, the author's description of the collapse of Technical Sergeant Oaks during an artillery barrage was particularly chilling. Sergeant Oaks had been bold, brash and brave in basic training, but, after the first miss by an 88mm round, there was the sergeant "... huddled under his wet overcoat by the shelter entrance." The sergeant's improper behavior had all "... but disabled me." On the same page, Babcock includes an interesting fact: most German Artillery fire during World War II was, in fact, 105mm, not the famous (infamous) 88mm. (Page 31). And, for those who served in the Army specialized Training Program (ASTP), page 154 presents the reason that the ASTP program was reduced dramatically: "... (t)hat almost all (replacements) went into the infantry was a given. Forty thousand replacements coming into our ranks translated to ten thousand men per week leaving the front lines for hospitals or for Dutch or Belgian cemeteries". I have never read such a succinct summary of the horrendous ETO casualty rate that caused General George Marshall to downsize ASTP and to move so many Air Corps candidates into the infantry. Excellent writing; excellent story telling.

"Lincoln, A Foreigner's Quest" by Jan Morris, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York 2000.The book does not live up to the title. Although she is an excellent writer, Jan Morris has not satisfied her title. When I picked up this book, I expected to see our 16th President through the eyes of an outsider, who would bring a different insight to Lincoln. Instead, Morris has done the classical: she views the past through the standards and mores of the present . In a small book, however, she covers many of the myths or stories about Abraham Lincoln, despite the many mistakes found by Amazon reviewers, above.However, I particularly object to her inflicting upon American readers the continuous British preoccupation with class, as she writes about Lincoln, on p. 88, that he might have considered himself as, ..."the clever imaginative, impressionable young man out of a lower social stratum bewitched by an upper-class style, and perhaps discerning it properly as his own." Her preoccupation with class misses the mark of frontier America. This book is a compact collection of Lincoln anecdotes but it does not live up to its title.

"The Medic" by Leo Litwak. Sub-titled "Life and Death in the Last days of WWII. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2001.This is a well-written story of a young man who had just finished his first year at the University of Michigan and was drafted,in February 1943. Leo Litwak was assigned to the medical corps with initial training with a detachment in South Carolina. The book covers the time from this training to his arrival in European Theater of Operations (EOT) in November 1944, until the end of the war. At the very end of his time in Europe, he recounts how his unit had to turn over the village (made-up name of "Grossdorf") to the Russians as it was on Soviet side of the occupation line. Litwak had studied a little German, so he was able to communicate in "bare-bones German" (P. 137) with not only the people in the occupied towns but also with the survivors of nearby concentration camps. The author devotes a long chapter to his assignation , while on leave in Paris (1945) with the hooker, Marishka, but the writing is done in a sensitive and quiet way.Litwak's writing is generally excellent: Page 115, example " ...German Soldiers, whom we once considered awesome predators - well clad, well armed, well disciplined, red in tooth and claw". Now, as prisoners, the Germans were "... flock animals, indistinguishable from each other". The author has also done a good job of capturing the constant use of profanity in routine conversations in the military. There is profanity in the book, but not near as much as you would encounter in daily conversations. When I served in the U. S. Navy in the late 1950s, the sailors would answer affirmatively by saying, "F---ing `A'!", not just a simple "Yes!". My son served in the Marine Corps in the early 1990s, and he reports that the same amount of profanity was used. The author has included just enough profanity to capture the essence of routine military dialogue.Finally, Leo Litwak ends the book with a summary that many probably felt, (Page 225): " Now I wanted us to be scattered and never reassembled. No more armies or divisions or regiments or battalions ... No veterans' groups, no reunions, no visits to old battlefields ... Let that all be in the past, cleansed by recollection."

"Masters of Death" by Richard Rhodes, subtitled, "The SS Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust". Alfred A. Knopf, 2002.Due to the subject matter, this is a tough book to read. Richard Rhodes has documented, in explicit detail, the killing of more than 20 million human beings by Nazi Germany. For almost all of them, their only crime was to be "Untermensch", or sub-human, according to the Nazi definition. Rhodes notes that twice as many Slavs ( 3 million Poles, 7 million Soviet citizens and 3.3 million Soviet POWs ) were killed than were Jews. (Page 157). The Jews were, however, the main target, with grandiose Nazi plans for the elimination of 700,000 Jews in unoccupied France, 330,000 in England and the even the 4000 Jews who lived in Ireland. (page 237) The Nazi plan was to empty the eastern steppes of the indigenous Slavs and re-settle Germans there. Adolph Hitler identified "...Stalin's communism ..[as] ...a new form of Russian imperialism" (Page 86) and the resettlement of the Germans in the East would form a barrier against the ancient enemy.The first few chapters developed a psychological theory of the bully-murderer and how that cruel personality type was not only legitimatized but also became the norm in the SS groups. The author has made Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) the central character in the book's development of the evolution of the killing methods. Himmler could not live up to his own ideals of the SS hero. The shooting of an actual person, "up close and personal", was too much for Himmler's weak stomach and, this, coupled with the economy of mass murder, led to the introduction of the gas chambers. Impersonal killing had been instituted in the Third Reich with the physician-assisted killing of the handicapped German children in the Autumn of 1939 (page 154). Some of the chapters are especially difficult with German reports, enumerating the killing of so many Jews, here in this town and in that city, and the pages flow into an accountant's recital, when it is human lives being considered. The author brings it all to life by identifying each reporting officer and noting that numbers were "absurdly precise".Rhodes does stumble here and there. As noted in other Amazon reviews, he has the U.S. declaring war on Germany, when, historically, Germany went first and then, Congress, not Roosevelt, declared war on Germany. In the note on page 125, he applies the term, "An inflated reference to Stalin's partisan order" concerning that "... the Russian side had ordered to have the SS members and Party members shot " ... when these Germans were taken prisoner. I do not know why he terms this "an inflated reference" as all German prisoners were being shot out of hand, so quickly that Soviet officers had to give orders to hold them for interrogation. (See "The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945" by Alfred-Maurice De Zayas). Finally, SS-Gruppenfueher Max Thomas was first introduced on page 163. The author could have told us more about an individual who "...was a doctor by profession" and had such an obviously English name. All of this adds up to four stars.

"Practical Reliability Engineering" by Patrick D.T. O'Connor, (with David Newton and Richard Bromley), John Wiley &amp; sons, Chichester &amp; New York, 1996. Third Edition Revised.Back in the 1980s, I used the first edition of this book, and it was very helpful then. The third edition has been expanded to add a few chapters, including what I would call a "motivational" first chapter, entitled, "Introduction To Reliability Engineering", pages 1 to 16. This first chapter answers many of the questions that management used to ask, and to whom the final reply was, "We do Reliability because it is a contract item". Now, you can refer the managers to the first chapter.The original edition once began with Chapter 2, "Reliability Mathematics", fundamental needed to understand Reliability; that chapter has been expanded in this edition, so much so that some has overflowed into Chapter 3, "Probability Plotting". Chapter 3 is a very complete chapter, being a compendium of the different kinds of probability paper, along with a short explanation of how to use the paper.Interestingly enough, Chapter 5, "Reliability Prediction and Modeling" had a shipboard missile system reliability problem (pages 129-132) which was an explicit example of what we were attempting to portray on one contract. When the Naval Officers saw O' Connor's example, it made it so much easier for us as our work paralleled expert's work in the book's example. This alone was worth the price of the book. Chapter 10, "Software Reliability" is greatly expanded over the previous editions and is up-to-date with current best practices in the field. This new edition of the book is highly recommended as it provides a concise collection of reliability fundamentals. John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.

"America` First Dynasty" by Richard Brookhiser. Sub-titled: "The Adamses, 1713-1918".Understandably, this book concentrates on the two presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Their contributions as one-term presidents help to establish democracy in the nascent United States. Brookhiser notes that the two Adamses were the first presidents not from Virginia. Much of what John Adams did became precedents for later presidents.It appears to me that the author makes the tacit assumption that the reader has a fairly good knowledge of American history, so he casually introduces lesser know subjects, such as the "Know Nothing Party " (Native American Party) and the anti-Masonic efforts in upstate New York. This, of course, leads you to things that you want to examine further, but, on the other hand, inhibits the free-flow of the book.I think that the author is stretching to consider Charles Francis or even Henry Adams as "greats" who were continuing the Adams "dynasty". I did, however, enjoy Brookhiser's "book review" approach to "The Education of Henry Adams" and Henry's book on Mont St. Michel. Perhaps the next book by Brookhiser would be the comparison of the contributions of the Adamses, the Harrisons, the Roosevelts and the Bushes: all presidents who related by blood.I listened to the seven tapes as I commuted around Boston; excellent reading by Dan Cashman. It is appropriate to note the name of the town of Haverhill is pronounced as HAV AAAA rill by the natives.. The reader sounded it out and said Have Er Hill, which is logical but not the way it is said in Massachusetts. Further, the hometown of the Adamses , Quincy, is said as "QuinZZZy".

"Road Rage" by Ruth Rendell. Subtitled: "An Inspector Wexford Mystery". Audio Book Version read by Christopher Ravenscroft. Random House Audiobooks, 1997.I chose this audiobook because I thought it would be about the typical Californian or New York road rage where one person is yelling at or even shooting at another driver. The rage in this book, however, is anger against the building of a road through Markham Wood. At first it appeared that this might be the usual plot where an environmental group protests the construction of highway by kidnapping hostages. But, then, there are many plot twists.The hostages were "randomly" selected by their unfortunate calling for a taxicab from a particular car for hire company. One of the hostages thus selected is Dora Wexford, wife of Inspector Wexford, which places a personal twist on the efforts of "Sacred Globe", the kidnapping environmental group, to enforce their position on the authorities. But there are even more twists than just this one, as Inspector Wexford pieces together all the clues and determines the location where the hostages are being kept, and where a hostage was killed. The ending is surprising!I enjoyed the audiotape version of this book, performed by Christopher Ravenscroft, as I drove I-495, the ring road around Boston. To American ears, Mr. Ravenscroft did a credible job in providing "Cockney" accents, British police accents and, of course, the educated "Oxford" accent. He has a wide ranging repertoire of accents, for both male and female characters.

"Under The Wire" by William Ash (with Brendan Foley). Sub-titled, "The World War II Adventures Of A Legendary Escape Artist And `Cooler King'". St. Martin's Press, New York 2005.William Ash was raised in Depression-Era Texas, where he learned the hard way that life is rough. Those lessons stood him in good stead when he became an expert escape artist from the POW camps of Nazi Germany. As he said, on page 22, his "twilight actives" prepared him by: "...being an unwelcome nonpaying passenger, learning how to avoid the attention of guard dogs or the authorities, sharing food and political discussions with men just as badly off as myself , and sometimes just learning to laugh in the face of everything the world could throw at me." He calls his younger days as "An Apprenticeship In Escapology".Building on the first two chapters, he then relates the story of his decision to fly for the RAF, his aviation training, first in Canada, and then in the actual combat zone in England during the Blitz. Because of his flying for the RAF, he had to renounce his American citizenship. There are vivid descriptions of London under the bombs, with destruction and fire seemingly everywhere. Then comes the chapter that changes everything: "The Day Of Reckoning". (page 85): "I cut my engine, since it was clearly full of holes and not doing much good".Shot down over occupied France, William Ash is helped by some French farmers, who struggle with his high school French but help him to find the underground resistance. He is, however, captured in Paris in June 1942, but not before he was able to enjoy the city of Paris as any tourist would do. The bulk of the book, from page 101 (the capture) to page 307 (his return to London) deals with his experiences with German Prisoner Of War system. The Gestapo threatens to shot him as a spy, as he is in civilian clothes, etc. He is "rescued" from the Gestapo by the Luftwaffe, as the German Air Force claimed all air force type POWs as their responsibility. Ash then relates his travels from camp to camp, through bombed out German cities, and finally arriving in a POW camp about as far East as the Reich went. His escape attempts are recorded in detail and his punishments, each time he was re-captured, made him, as the book flap recounts, the "real-life `cooler king'". This book documents a real-life "Great Escape" story.

"Arnhem" by Christopher Hibbert. Phoenix Paperbacks, New York 1998.This book was originally written in 1962, which predates the 1974 book, "A Bridge Too Far" by Cornelius Ryan. Ryan's book is about the defeat of the Allies in Operation Market Garden. Hibbert's book is about the defeat of the British at the bridge in Arnhem.In my opinion, Christopher Hibbert has written a meticulous history from the British point of view, so much so that the author lionizes Field Marshall Montgomery. Later books, including Ryan's, point out the inconsistencies in Montgomery's plans for Operation Market Garden, 1944. The author, Hibbert, however, would almost have you believe that the failure of Market Garden was due to General Eisenhower's decision to spread the logistics around so that General Bradley and General Patton received too many supplies with the result that Montgomery's forces did not receive enough. At least that's what I get from reading the book.Then, Hibbert mentions but does not give enough emphasis, in my opinion, to some of the mistakes that Montgomery made. For example, on page 45 (paperback), the author mentions that the Dutch resistance reported that there were two SS Panzer Divisions near the proposed drop zone at Arnhem. Further, the major, who was the aerial photograph analyst, was brow-beaten into quiet, so photos showing the Nazi armor were ignored.Having said all this, bear in mind that this review is not intended to cast any aspersions on the superlative efforts of the British forces. All in all, this book gives you many, many details abut the heroism of the British forces at Arnhem.

"First To Die" by James Patterson, Tape read by Melissa Leo and Dylan BakerTime Warner Audio Books, 2001.Leave it to a murder mystery writer to come up with a murder mystery/thriller where the chief suspect is a mystery writer! Then, in this day of Political Correctness, Patterson develops a team of four women, (one of whom is black) to deal with all the evidence some of which is planted. All of this becomes implausible. For example, the woman's team has the hardest time getting the draft copy of one of the first novels that the suspect has written. This draft of the first novel becomes a key issue, as it is a blueprint for the murders. Then, out of the clear blue, the author has Warren Jacoby, the police partner of the chief protagonist, Inspector Lindsay Boxer, making causal comments on the novel he had read. Seems there were multiple copies available! Too many twists, and the motivation for the killer to do all these Wedding Day Killings is not really, truly developed.The reader of the audio version, Melissa Leo, does a fine job in characterization of all the major female personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors. I enjoyed this audio book as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston, in my daily commute.

&quot;Being Right: Conservative Catholics in America&quot;, edited by Mary Jo Weaver and R. Scott Appleby. 1995. The editors have collected 12 different chapters representing the conservative Catholic point of view on matters ranging from the &quot;Loss of Theological Unity&quot; to American Catholics in the pro-life movement. This book is definitively written from the Catholic view. For example, you will not find a chapter on the Fundamentals' controversy over creationism versus evolution, as that has already been put to bed by the statements of at least three popes. Our separated Protestant brethren will also probably wonder at the theme of the chapter on the loss of theological unity. There is a &quot;resource&quot; chapter on the &quot;Fellowship of Catholic Scholars&quot; which I found more of a recruiting nature, but then, that is acceptable. There is the obligatory politically correct chapter on the Hispanic observations on the conservative-liberal controversies, in which the Jesuit author displays his own cultural insensitivity by using &quot;Anglo&quot;, to lump together all those who are &quot;white&quot; as Anglos. Just because my eyes are blue, my skin fair and my hair blonde, (when I had hair) does not classify me as an Anglo. Many of us of Irish descent consider the term &quot;Anglo&quot; to be insulting. Of most interest to me was the chapter by Professor Weaver (Indiana University) on the four &quot;restoration&quot; Catholic colleges which are bucking the secularization trend of the 230+ Catholic colleges. I used her chapter in my MA, History thesis. Overall, the book is worth the effort to purchase ( I bought my copy through Amazon.com) and to use as a benchmark to measure trends in Catholicism in the U.S.

"Curious George: A Very Monkey Christmas". 2009 DVDIn December 2009, this DVD was purchased for Sophie, our granddaughter. The animated presentation had pretty scenes of a city in December snow, and a nice trip to the country to get a Christmas tree, and baking Christmas cookies and so many other Christmas traditions, all nicely animated.But, now it is June 2010, and when we babysit Sophie (22 months old), she always selects the yellow case holding this DVD. So, of course, we have to play the animated movie for her, and our little girl dances to the song, "A Very Monkey Christmas", putting her arms in the air to follow the characters on the screen. She also tries to hum along with the initial Christmas song:"Are you ready for Christmas Day to come?""Sing it with me, or if you're a monkey, `Hum'".My wife, a retired school teacher, says that George the Monkey uses non-verbal communication, pointing at objects and making monkey sounds, which appeals to young children. When children are just learning to speak, they seem to be able to follow and enjoy the antics of George the Monkey. The colors, the songs and the plot probably will appeal to older children. As for me, I liked the portrayal of a city in a snowy December, and the method the Man In the Yellow Hat uses to instill some sense of patience in the little monkey. The songs are novel and interesting, and low enough so that an old grandfather can sing along. Watch the light decorations light up as George and The Man In The Yellow Hat walk away after they donate some bills to the Santa ringing the bell.Nice touch!

"Another River, Another Town" by John P. Irwin, sub-titled "A Teenage Tank gunner Come of Age in Combat-1945." Random House, New York, 2002.With the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944, there was a great demand on the United States Army for replacements in the European Theater of Operations. Pennsylvanian John P. Irwin had just completed tank gunner training in Fort Knox and was shipped to France. He was immediately put in charge, as ranking soldier, of a Sherman tank, and, after completing repairs, instructed to join up with the 3rd Armored Division. Running as a single tank, trying to catch the main column, Irwin and his crew promptly get lost. They end up in a German occupied town, and, happily for them, the Germans want to surrender. Corporal Irwin leads the German column back to American lines, where he is chewed out by Captain Harker for delivering unwanted prisoners! Thus begins Irwin's tour of duty in the closing period of World War II in Europe.His book describes the relations among the five-man crew, the agony of having a tank shot out from underneath them, and the daily drudgery in going from town to town, river to river, bridge to bridge. Their replacement tank is one of the new Pershing Tanks, and Irwin describes how the Pershing's extra armor, its ability to fire while still moving and the Pershing's rapid gun turret movement saved them in many situations. (For a complete comparison of Sherman and Pershing, see, "Death Traps" by Belton Y. Cooper.) This book is well written and easy to read.

"Shot From The Sky" by Cathryn J. Prince.Subtitled: "American POWs In Switzerland"Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 2003.The writer, Cathryn Prince, had the opportunity to live and work in Switzerland, which gave her the time to dig into the nooks and crannies of the Swiss archives. She used this timely opportunity to document a blacker picture of Swiss "neutrality" during World War II.Prince shows that some Swiss were intimidated by the proximity of the Third Reich, while other Swiss (particularly the German speaking Swiss) were intoxicated by the initial successes of Nazi Germany. As the author, Prince, relates that, whatever the reason, Switzerland practiced a form of "neutrality" that favored the Axis Powers. So did Sweden. Cathryn Prince then "compares and contrasts" (remember your History courses?), the recorded actions of Sweden and Switzerland, vis-a vis Allied airmen. The Swedes, like the Swiss, were caught in a web of neutrality that favored Nazi Germany. How many tons of iron ore were shipped from neutral Sweden to support the war efforts of the Third Reich? The Swedes, however, handled Allied airmen in a fashion that was diametrically opposed to the Swiss method; for example, there was no concentration camp in Sweden for recalcitrant Allied airmen who were prone to escape to get back into the war. The author documents the Swiss strictness towards Allied airmen internees, and, on the other hand, the Swiss liberality towards Luftwaffe Internees. Towards Americans, the Swiss "correctness" leaned towards meanness, particularly when the Americans exhibited tendencies to disappear from beautiful Switzerland.All in all, I believe that Cathryn Prince has prepared a well-documented and excellently written condemnation of the Swiss record of handling American airmen in the Second World War.By the bye, if any of my fellow Irish would like a readable book on the "neutrality" of the Irish Free State, I would suggest, "That Neutral Island", subtitled, "A Cultural History Of Ireland During The Second World War", by Clair Wills, Belknap Press, Harvard University, September 2007. In that book, the author shows that, while the Irish denied their ports to the Royal Navy, many thousands of Irish volunteered for British forces. American airmen who crashed in the 26 counties of the Free State were returned to Belfast, so, in sum, Irish neutrality favored the Allies. In the book, "Shot From The Sky", the author, Cathryn Prince did not even mention Ireland and Irish neutrality... at least I did not find it.

"The Last Kilometer" by A. Preston Price.Subtitled: "Marching To Victory With The Big Red One, 1944-1945."Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 2002.Arthur Preston Price was a 1943 graduate of The Citadel, the famous military academy in Charleston, South Carolina. Price, however, was actually born in Germany, 1921, in a U.S. Army hospital where his father was a doctor. The book does not really state where he learned German, but Lt. Price was proficient in the German language. His proficiency in German makes this book even more interesting as Price was called upon to interpret as his unit marched through Europe.His story begins with the ship transporting him to Europe, in November 1944. Most military memoirs have a lengthy recounting of childhood and schooling, but Price's book jumps directly into the action. On board ship, the SS China Mail, the new lieutenant enjoys the ocean voyage while most of his compatriots are sea sick. In France, they "...decide we will be here for about a month..." and then, "...suddenly we are told to pack and be ready to leave in fifteen minutes". That quote is on page 7, and from then on, the book moves rapidly, as Lt. Price describes, in the first person, his experience in the last months of the war in Europe. The book covers his travels ("From Roehr To The Rhine"), his "corner" of the Battle of the Bulge, the Remagen Bridgehead, and through the Harz Mountains down into Czechoslovakia.Lt. Price's assignment was forward observer for the mortar platoon, which means that he saw more than most soldiers as they advanced. He had to know where the American soldiers were going and then had to determine where to place the mortar rounds as the troops advanced. Due to his job, he was more aware of the where and when the action took place, and this shows in his account. The book is well written, which shows the efforts of the author and which makes it easy for the reader. Of course, the editing at the U.S. Naval Institute is always superb.

"Mother Hubbard's Christmas", by John O'Brien, and illustrated by John O'Brien. Boyds Mills Press, Honesdale, Pennsylvania, 1996.This book is really written for the sophisticated child or for an adult. If you recall your Mother Goose rhymes, you will laugh at the various outcomes, the strange actions that the dog takes."She poured him a cupOf holiday cheerBut when she looked upHe was riding a deer".Not a reindeer, but a deer. This fractured version of the ordinary nursery rhyme caused my seven year old granddaughter to constantly giggle, but my young grandson (only three years' old), was constantly asking, "Why is the dog blue?" and "Why are the Christmas Trees blue?" Certainly, this book was not addressed to someone so young, but it is difficult to read a book and exclude any of the near by children.I only assigned three stars, because this book is a little too cute and a little too sophisticated, and aimed, I think, more at the adults who listen when the book is read aloud. Perhaps I prefer my trees the traditional green...

"Pimpernel Gold" by Dorothy Baden-PowellSubtitled: "How Norway Foiled The Nazis".St. Martin's Press, New York 1978.This book reads like a movie plot. In reality, it was written by a Norwegian lady who served in the WRNS, (Women's Royal Naval Service) in the Second World War. Dorothy Baden-Powell also served in the British SOE (Special Operations Executive), whose task was to "...set Europe ablaze", according to Winston Churchill. Dorothy Baden-Powell records her experiences in another book.The author was friendly with King Haakon of Norway, and also with Crown Prince Olav. She uses some of their memories to fill in places in the book, "Pimpernel Gold". In April, 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Norway, and met with some early successes and some naval set-backs. What we would call "special forces", nowadays, were sent into the snowy country of Norway to (a) capture the king and the crown prince and (b) grab Norway's gold reserves. The author recounts how groups of Norwegian volunteers were gathered to collect the tons of gold bullion, load it on a train and move everything away from the rapidly approaching front lines. Almost casually, she tells how the Norwegian "reserve soldiers" gather their rifles, load the gold, convince the SWEDISH train engineer to get going and race away from the advancing Germans. The book was like a movie. The train just gets away from one group of Germans. The Norwegians hide the train, loaded with gold, in a gully/valley, but they still discovered by a German scout plane. Are they being betrayed by Norwegian Quisling spies?? A Nazi force, looking for the King, finds the gold train, but the Germans are easily defeated. One Norwegian volunteer is killed, and then, later in the book, his brother is also killed.The decision is made to off-load the gold onto "lorries", and these trucks race ahead of the advancing German army. The fully loaded trucks reach a coastal port, where most of the gold is loaded onto allied destroyers. One set of vehicles are delayed by a bombing raid (the Luftwaffe was very active), and reach the port after the last vessel has left. So!, HMS Glasgow, a Royal Navy destroyer, is signalled and she comes into the port to get the last of the gold. While all of this naval maneuvering is taking place, the leader of the Norwegian volunteers (who have saved Norway's gold) is greeted by Norway's King Haakon, who is also leaving the country.If it weren't for the war time experiences of Dorothy Baden-Powell, the reader would be inclined to dismiss some of the coincidences and easy victories of the Norwegian volunteers as too much artistic license of an arm-chair author, but she tells like it was.

&#65533;Terminal Event&#65533; by James Stewart Thayer, Large Print, Beeler Large Print, Hampton Falls, NH, 2000.This book opens with a horrific scene: former NTSB investigator, Joe Durant, is running towards an airplane crash and encountering parts of human bodies. As a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator, Durant has seen many crashes, but this one is different: he knows that his wife was on Emerald Airlines plane called&#65533; Sacajawea&#65533;.Author James Thayer then develops three major plot lines in the investigation into the cause(s) of the crash and each plot line depends upon the kind of people, the characters, involved. The first centers on Joe Durant, the NTSB engineer, who develops an engineering theory based upon improper design or, perhaps, incorrect maintenance. The second revolves around the FBI and ATF agents, who scour the Northwest part of the Untied States for skinhead groups who are anti-government enough to shoot down commercial airliners. The third plot line introduces a Saudi Arabian prince, in the United States for treatment of alcoholism. His presence on the crashed plane is ascertained from identification of those attending funerals and memorial services, and determining why those individuals would be at these events. All three plots compete and it seems, to the reader, that each competing cause is plausible: engineering failure, or terrorist attacks or assassination of the Saudi. But then, not to give away the surprise ending, the main protagonist , Joe Durant, discovers the one important clue that leads to the actual killer.The discussion of technology is appropriate to this type of mystery, and the hint of romance, with the hotshot FBI agent, Linda Dillon, serves to lighten the book. Author James Thayer does know the Northwest part of the country. Read the book to find out &#65533;who dun it&#65533;.

"Devil's guard" by George Robert Elford. Sub-titled: "The Incredible Story Behind The French Foreign Legion's Nazi Battalion In Indochina". Delacorte Press, New York 1971.Did we win the war and lose the battle? Or did we win the battle and lose the war? From the point of view of Hans Josef Wagemueller, the SS Commandant who refused to surrender, we had just won a battle with the end of World War II, and it was then necessary for us to continue the war against the Bolsheviks. The first three chapters of this book show how his SS unit retreated across Bavaria , while protecting itself from Allied threats. This was at a time when SS units were being shot down rather than being permitted to surrender. Wagemueller's pleas for justice are extinguished by the example of Nazi justice. Jews and Poles and Ukrainians were "guilty" only of being "Untermensch". For this sin, they received no trial, no court room procedures, no findings under the law, and they were executed. If some SS were not guilty of war crimes, but were condemned without a trial, then they were being served with the same justice that the Nazis had dished out.After getting back within Germany, some of the men(a substantial quantity)were able to flee through Switzerland and join the French Foreign Legion. There is a gap in the book here, as it does not clearly explain how it was possible that so many Germans, and so many of them impenitent Nazis, were permitted to join the Legion.The majority of the book, the remaining fifteen chapters, then conveys the story of the SS Group efforts to subdue and control the revolutionary Viet Minh in what was once called French Indochina. The gruesome details of some of the battles, the procedures used, the basic inhumanity, are presented as routine operations. Hans Josef Wagemueller, which is the nom-de-plume of the SS Commandant, tells the story in the first person. He recites the lessons they had learnt in Russia while hunting partisans, and shows how they were applied against the guerillas in the jungle. All of this is very realistically presented, making a book that I only care to read once.

"Terrors And Marvels" by Tom Shachtman, sub-titled "How Science and Technology Changed the Character and Outcome of World War II".HarperCollins Publishers, 2002.This book attempts too much. The author attempted a more or less complete history of technology development and its impact in all the warring nations of World War II. The resultant volume is almost an Anglophile book, emphasizing more the war between the Western Allies and the Nazis. History is not only the material being included but also by whatever is excluded; Shachtman tends to include the efforts and counter-measures of the Anglo-Americans against the Germans. Often excluded are the successes in the Pacific Theatre. For example, at the commencement of hostilities, the Japanese Imperial Navy had an advantage in night fighting over the American navy. When radar was introduced to American ships, night fighting advantage swung to the Americans. This important story is not really covered in this book. In a similar fashion, the struggle for air superiority in the Pacific was a major technological success for the Americans. The Mitsubishi Zero fighter permitted Japan to dominate the early war in the Pacific. Then, the efforts of Grumman Aviation, Long Island, NY, as an example, in developing the Wildcat countered the advantage of the Japanese Zero. This story would be enough for a book in itself. On page 111, Shachtman notes that the Dutch government ordered "...its two radar experts to flee to Great Britain". Why not give the names of these two Dutchmen? And why not edit out the in fighting in England where one Englishman was made a lord and the other was insulted? Who cares? The major technological advance and change from marvel into a terror was, of course, the development of the atomic bomb. This effort has been documented so well in other books, that the author does not pay enough attention (in my opinion) to the success of the Manhattan Project and the use of the A-bomb.I found this book difficult to read. The book is generally in chronological order, but the author uses "white spaces" as the simple expedient to signal a subject change. This results in the reader's attention being focused on a subject, and then, in the next paragraph, you have jumped from guided missile rocketry to the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets. (p. 227). With all due respect, in a work where any one of the interesting technological subjects could fill the entire book, why bring in something as unrelated to the theme as Katyn Forest?The book would benefit from one more editing review. Besides moving the port of Antwerp back to Belgium (see the other Amazon reviews), the editor could look at some other pages:...Page 211: High Frequency Direction Finder: the author calls HFDF a "radar". High Frequency Direction Finder was NOT a radar, but rather a technique to obtain range and bearing on a source of RF transmission. If two vessels could obtain range and bearing on a submarine transmitting, then, by triangulation, it was possible to determine the sub's position. Technological incorrect to call HFDF "radar"...Page 234: Author uses "...1500 valves in `Colossus'" ... when else where in the book (see Raytheon) he employs the American term, "vacuum tube". Need to be consistent.Page 254: Error: "would not to use it against third parties" should read "...would not use it against...".Five stars for the content and attempt to bring so much history into one book. One star for mistakes that would not be acceptable on an MA thesis. Average: three stars.

"Gods And Generals", by Jeff Shaara, Audio book read by Stephen Lang.Random House Audio, Inc, 1998.The central character of this book is General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, (1824-1863). The book is presented from the viewpoint of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The book does deal peripherally with Confederate generals Longstreet, A.P. Hill, cavalry general Jeb Stuart, but all from the view of how they interacted with Jackson, or laid the path for actions and battles in which Stonewall Jackson was involved. On the Union side, the chief protagonist is General Winfield Scott Hancock and accordingly he receives more attention than, say, Union General Joshua Chamberlain (the hero of Gettysburg) or Irish Brigade General Thomas Meagher (pronounced MAAhar). In fact, this is one of the few books not explicitly addressing the Irish Brigade that actually gives credit to that general and his famous Civil War outfit for its bravery at places such as Antietam and Fredericksburg.Stonewall Jackson is described as leaving his teaching position at Virginia Military Institute, but bringing most of the cadet corps with him to serve in the newly forming Confederate army. A brief interlude describes how Jackson earned the name of "Stonewall" at the Battle of Bull Run, July 1861, and how that name stuck with him. (I wonder why Shaara did not describe the Fighting 69th, the core of Irish Brigade at Bull Run? That New York outfit was one of the few Union groups to retire from the field in order.) The book then deals with change in leadership of the Army of Potomac, and the errors the Union generals made at Antietam and Fredericksburg.The audio book builds up the tension until the darkness of the Battle of Chancellorsville, where Stonewall Jackson was shot by Southern troops. Shaara ascribes a poignant quote to General Lee, who wrote to Jackson that, "...you may have lost your left arm, but I have lost my right". Many historians think that the Civil War would have been greatly different, or, at least, much longer, if the team of Lee and Jackson had been able to collaborate on defeating the different commanding generals that President Lincoln put in charge of the Army of Potomac. Just as an aside, the Western Theatre is hardly mentioned, so, naturally, the name of U.S. Grant is not mentioned either.The audio book's reader failed to develop a true Southern accent with which he tried to characterize the Confederate generals. Thus, when he came to dialogue assigned to Robert E. Lee, the reader lowered his voice to a quiet tone, which, along with the Southern drawl, made the character appear, to my ears, effeminate as opposed to a voice of a commanding general.

"The Battle For History" by John Keegan.Subtitled:"Re-fighting World War II".Vintage Books, Random House, New York. 1996.If you have ever taken a course in History, you know what a bibliographic essay is. The professor assigns an obscure episode in the events of some small country and then you have to "research" the events, find credible references and write a literate paper telling all about it. You think that you're done when you hit "Return" on the computer and the paper is complete. Or is it? Nope, the prof wants a bibliographic essay, which is a list of books and articles consulted, and your estimation of the "correctness" or value of each reference. I think that the teachers thought up bibliographic essays so that the student could not plagiarize just one book and submit it as the student's own paper.So, with this preamble, you can see that I would be apprehensive when I picked up John Keegan's little book, (only 128 pages), which is fundamentally a bibliographic essay on the Second World War. But, this book is a wonderful bibliographic essay. The author jumps right into the heart of the matter in Chapter 1, which is entitled, "Controversy And The Second World War". In this small chapter, Keegan deals with the works of the controversialist, A.J.P. Taylor, as to the origins of the War, then Keegan goes on to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union (22 June 1941), and who know what about when and how. Did Stalin really expect Hitler to leave Russia in peace? The next controversy handled was whether or not F.D. Roosevelt knew in advance that the Japanese were going to bomb Pearl Harbor. Then, a portion of this chapter deals with the effectiveness of the bombing campaign is alone worth the price of the book. Excellent work on controversies.The book then treats the different histories that have been written about World War II, and it is up to you to agree or disagree with the author. There is a chapter on biographies, with an emphasis on the important personalities, ranging from Hitler and Stalin to Churchill and Roosevelt. Of course, De Gaulle and Truman are mentioned.Page 60: Montgomery "...is unarguably one of the war's great generals".Keegan dismisses the revisionism of authors such as David Irving and James Bacque. Keegan states that the best thing that James Bacque, (author of the book, "Other Losses" which disparaged General Eisenhower's reputation), could do was to remain silent. With David Irving, on the other hand, Keegan just shakes his head.All in all, Keegan's work," The Battle For History", is worth reading and re-reading; the book is a wonderful reference work on the Second World War.

"Escape To Manila" by Frank Ephraim. Subtitled "From Nazi Tyranny To Japanese Terror". University of Illinois Press, 2003.This is a collection of intriguing stories, documenting the escape of many different Jewish people, families and individuals, from the impending Holocaust in Nazi dominated Europe. One of the escapees is the author, Frank Ephraim, who has done a great deal of research on how and when the individual escapees reached Manila, The Philippines, and their fate when the Japanese were forced out.Each of the intriguing stories has its own chronology: some Jews escaped in the early 1930s, when the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws painted a dark picture of their future, while others did not leave until the September 1st 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland. These necessarily different chronologies can be confusing as you read this interesting book. Further, the author insists giving the date of the Pearl Harbor attack as December 8th, I.e. Manila time, as the Philippines are on the other side of the International Dateline. Of particular interest to me was the story of the young man who flew from Europe to the ends of Asia (Shanghai) in a German JU52. He was the only passenger. That kind of trip was rare enough at that time, but for a Jew who was escaping it was audacious. Further, the author completes the story, through enough research, to track down what happened to that aircraft after Pearl Harbor.The author's research has some flaws, however. On page 73 he mentions the Catholic De La Salle College", which he attended on Taft Avenue in Manila. He states that the College was staffed by "... Jesuit brothers". This is in error. De La Salle College was begun and staffed by the Christian Brothers De La Salle, an order of teaching brothers begun by St. John Baptist De La Salle(1651-1719) in Reims, France. The Jesuits do have brothers, but they were begun by St. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556). When I checked the notes in the back of the book, the reference to the college and the Jesuits brothers was based upon "personal recollection". In my Historiography classes, my professor warned me against depending solely on personal recollection or personal memory. So, I went to the web site for De La Salle College (now University) and that confirmed that it was the Christian Brothers De La Salle. By the way, the Japanese massacred fifteen of the Brothers in the last days of the occupation. As a graduate of Manhattan College, begun by the Christian Brothers De La Sale in 1853, I am, perhaps, oversensitive to any slight, intended or unintended, to them.

"1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls" by Winston Groom, Atlantic Monthly Press, New York, New York 2005.The central thesis of Winston Groom's book is that 1942 was the year in which the Allies' efforts hit a nadir and the year in which the Axis Powers were the most successful. (See Winston Churchill's "Their Finest Hour", 1951.)The current author, Winston Groom, spends some five (5) chapters on the run-up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor (December 7 1941), and from Chapter 6 (page 85) up to Chapter 17 (page 348), he deals mainly with the Japanese-American conflict in the South Pacific. His writing about the Marine defenders of Wake Island, the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal, General MacArthur's efforts on New Guinea is entertaining. (For a description of the air war in New Guinea, see: "Wreaking Havoc" by Joseph W. Rutter, Sub-titled, "A Year In An A-20". Texas A& M University Press, 2004.)In my humble opinion, however, Winston Groom neglects the German efforts in this book. He does not completely consider the Kriegsmarine efforts to sink all ships off the Atlantic and Caribbean coasts of the Untied States in 1942 (See, for example, the book, "Operation Drumbeat" by Michael Gannon, 1990). He gives short shrift to Field Marshall Erwin Rommel's Panzer drive to Egypt and the Suez Canal, and the Soviet resistance at Stalingrad receives scant attention in Groom's book. Although the writing is excellent, I believe that the author might have reduced his introductory five chapters, and beefed up the few chapters dealing with (a) the Nazi threat to defeat the Soviet Union and (b) the Nazi army connecting with the Japanese through the Middle East.In the note on page 76, Mr. Groom has the USS Wasp and the USS Hornet being named after "stinging insects". These ships were named after previous ships in the venerable naval service of the United States, as were the aircraft carriers "Enterprise" and "Ranger". .A little more research would have shown the author this. Further, his story about President Roosevelt's reply about the Doolittle raid on Tokyo could have been enhanced by a little research into the facts. FDR stated that the Doolittle raid had come from "Shangri-La" (page 193). If Mr. Groom had wanted, he could have noted that the Japanese stated that they had sunk the aircraft carrier "Shangri-La", and so, when the U.S. was building hundreds of carriers, CV-38 was named, "USS Shangri-La".[...]. [...]. Three times in the book, Mr. Groom describes the American Irish as the "British-hating American Irish" (e.g. page 387). Yet, Mr. Groom quotes the Irish ballad, "Kevin Barry", in his note on page 399. What's up with his relationship with the Irish-Americans?Five stars for excellent writing. One star for not making his theme. Five stars for entertaining writing on the Japanese-American war in the Pacific. One star for not doing enough research into the Naval Service. Average 3.0 stars.

"North Toward Home", by Willie Morris, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1967.This is the autobiography of a small town boy who went to the big city and became editor-in-chief of Harper's, once the oldest magazine in America. The book, 438 pages in the 1967 edition is broken up into three sections:(1) Mississippi: 146 pages.(2) Texas: 163 pages(3) New York: 125 pages.It is in his description of his young life in the small town of Yazoo City, Mississippi, that Mr. Morris really achieves his most memorable scenes and the most interesting writing in the book. His family is "old" and he explains that on his mother's side he is related to the Harpers who founded Harpers Ferry, Virginia.The section on university studies emphasizes his time at the University of Texas, where he over-committed himself by trying to become involved in just about everything. In this university section, the writing of Mr. Morris degrades towards the usual descriptions of fraternities, football and fornication, common enough for the colleges of the later fifties and early sixties.Finally, in the third section, dealing with New York City, his writing becomes even more mundane as he recounts his experiences, which could be entitled "Only In New York". this kind of thing is so common that late night TV talk shows use it as a fill-in staple. The redeeming quality of his writing is his ability to being the point of view of a Southerner to his New York City anecdotes. He calls NYC the "Big Cave".But, it is Morris, himself, who makes it clear why he is working in New York City, and not Mississippi. Morris recounts an anecdote concerning Robert Frost that sums up the intellectual achievement of his book and the South:"Once I had escorted Robert Frost in a taxicab to Rhodes house for a talk.`Where are you from, boy?' he had asked.`Mississippi', I replied.`Hell, that's the worst sate in the Union', he said.But, I argued, it had produced a lot of good writers.He said, `Can't anybody down there read them'". (Page 196).

"The Simple Sounds Of Freedom" by Thomas H. Taylor, Random House, New York 2002. The title of the book is derived from President Clinton's speech in France on the fiftieth anniversary of D Day.This is a biography of Joe Beyrle but the book is also a record of praise for the 101st Airborne. Joe Beyrle, from Michigan, was part of the 101st Airborne when that division dropped into Normandy on D-Day, 1944. He was captured, escaped, capture again and shipped off to a German POW camp. After one escape, he is captured in Berlin, the capital city of the Third Reich; he is tortured by Gestapo. Joe is rescued from the Gestapo by the German Army, the Wehrmacht, of all people, who claim him as their prisoner. They were following bureaucratic procedures, a common trait in Nazi Germany. After regaining his strength, Joe Beyrle again escapes, and this time, he is close enough to reach the relative safety of Soviet lines. After identifying himself as an American, Joe decides to stay with the Soviet armored column in order to kill Germans. Thus, he fights on both the Western and Eastern fronts in Europe in 1944-1945, fulfilling the sub-title of the book, "...Only Soldier to Fight For Both America and the Soviet Union in World War II".As a 101st Airborne combat veteran himself, the author was capable of an excellent job of bonding with Joe Beyrle, so as to produce an almost personal memoir direct from the Joe's memories. At times, it was difficult to distinguish between Beyrle and Taylor. At other times, particularly in Chapter Sixteen, entitled, "Bastogne", it was evident that it was all Thomas Taylor writing in praise of the division he loves, the 101st. From the viewpoint of a biography of Joe Beyrle, such chapters were unnecessary, but their presence rounds out the story and makes a better history of the time. By the way, the photo collection in the book shows Joe Beyrle aging in a remarkably similar fashion to the character of Private Ryan in the movie, "Saving Private Ryan".

"Flights Of Passage" by Samuel Hynes. Subtitled: "Reflections Of A World War II Aviator". Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1988.Samuel Hynes flew for the United States Marine Corps in the Second World War. God bless him. His personal memoir follows the usual pattern for many servicemen of World War II, where an entire generation left high school, received aviation training in some forsaken Southern state, and then went overseas to fight the war. Much of his book, however, is devoted to how these individuals, this special generation, grew from teen-aged youths into mature individuals: "The Flights Of Passage".With excellent writing, Hynes recounts his leaving his home state of Minnesota, his passion for flying that lead him into Naval Aviation and, incidentally, his encounters with different people, persons, as an example, with "...soft-slurring speech that at first we couldn't understand". Shopkeepers welcomed the Naval Pilot trainees as if they were old friends and said good-bye with "Y'all hurry back, heah?" As training progressed, Hynes began to sort out individuals, as an example, the city slicker and the rube. His telling comment about the know-it-all from South Dakota was how could you be a city slicker if you were from a state that had no cities? His most astute writing deals with the classification of the newly winged pilots into "Crazies" and "Sanes". Happily, the "Crazies" stayed back in the States and the "Sanes" carried the war to the enemy.Too much of the book is devoted to sexual encounters and to drinking. Samuel Hynes reflects the mores of his time when he begins with "Alice' who was pretty and in a sorority (both good), but who was a Catholic (bad). His characterization, not mine. The book is then littered with accounts of attempted sexual conquests, (not going-all-the-way), sexual conquests and then marriage. Explicit encounters with whores are described, as when "Green" tells how he got his money's worth from a prostitute. What ..."you might expect from a guy from New York who had gone to CCNY and wore a lavender sweatshirt".(City College of New York, along with Brooklyn College, Hunter College and Queens College, as part of the City University of New York, all had the colors of purple and white...NOT lavender. Further, Jesuit Fordham University and private New York University had the colors of purple and white. However, my alma mater, Manhattan College, a Catholic college in The Bronx, had the colors of Kelly green and white.)Also, there were many tales of drinking bouts and drunks. The locals were tolerant of Navy Fliers, as Hynes narrates: a drunken Naval Aviator climbs up an awning to get at a pretty girl. While climbing, he pulls down the awning and then simply walks away. No charges were pressed by the townsfolk.Little enough action is reported in this book. One pilot finally shots down a Jap plane by using air-to-ground rockets. Another pilot goes slightly daft and begins to paint everything blue: his Mae West, his helmet, his flying suit, and finally, his tent. Perhaps the most interesting event is when Hynes, and his two crew members in the TBM, wake up to find the engine off, due to lack of fuel. Hynes switches to another tank to fly safely home. Good for him.

"Inside The Battle Of The Bulge", by Roscoe C. Blunt, Jr. Westport, CT, Praeger, 1994.If you are looking for a book that tells the story of the Battle of the Bulge, (Dec, 1944), without listing a lot of movements of this numbered division against that Panzer group, and if you are looking for a more personal and human history of the battle, then Private Blount's memoirs are for you. The sub-title of this book is, "A Private Comes Of Age". The author traces not only his march across Europe, from the logistical landing at Normandy (after the battle) up to the 84th Infantry Division's reaching the Elbe River, but also the lessons he learned about man's inhumanity to man. He grew up in the European campaign.Unlike similar personal history books, the author presents an extra added attraction: records of the reactions of German soldiers and civilians. Young Blount had learned German in high school, so this personal memoir, written from notes he had made fifty years ago, is filled with comments from German soldiers and civilians. For example, there are some entertaining memories such as a short and chubby German woman who berated the advancing American troops, until Blount smacked her on the behind with the stock of his M-1. On the serious side, Private Blount describes in vivid detail the wounds suffered by both American and German soldiers, and how it was possible to become insensitive to such suffering. His description, however, of the concentration camp victims at "Nord Stalag III, Ohrdruf, is heart rending, on pages 173-174.The author pulls no punches in describing the officers of the American army. In fact, his account of some incidents, such as the lieutenant being awarded a Bronze Star, while not even mentioning the efforts of Pvt. Blount in destroying an enemy tank , makes you wonder if the country should shut down West Point. Further, his narrative of his court martial for fraternization with the Germans (since he was able to speak German) makes you wonder about the commonsense of some of the officers of the time.Over the last fifty or so years, Roscoe Blount has been "an award winning investigative journalist", (according to the back flap of the book cover), so the writing in this book is excellent. I would recommend this book to any one seeking a glimpse of how it was in the American army in Europe during the last crucial year of the war.

"The King Who Rained"" written & illustrated by Fred Gwynne, Aladdin Paperbacks, / Simon & Schuster 1970Homonym is the term for words which sound alike but mean different things. Because of its historical roots in both the Germanic and Latin branches of the Indo-European language family, the English language is rich in homonyms. Fred Gwynne, the noted TV actor, plays upon "reign", (from Latin/French roots, and meaning to rule), and the word "rain", from the Old Anglo-Saxon, and meaning "water dropping from the heavens". His front cover shows a king in ermine robes contentedly raining on the countryside, while a young girl, with an umbrella, gazes up at the ruler. This kind of thing continues through the book, making every page funny and interesting.The illustrations are colorfully done in what appears to be pastel chalks, and Fred Gwynne has probably included some autobiographical drawings as, for example, the Daddy with the mole on his nose is easily recognizable as the TV actor. This book is nicely illustrated and will provide many hours of reading enjoyment and learning.Personally, I found that the child-reader has to be in the first or second grade, or at least fairly well exposed to the nuances of the English language, or else the play on words, using homonyms, will be lost. The younger children appeared to be interested in the illustrations alone, which are stand-alone funny.

"In My Hands" By Irene Gut Opdyke, with Jennifer Armstrong. Subtitled: "Memories Of A Holocaust Rescuer". Alfred A. Knopf, New York. 1999.Jennifer Armstrong has written an excellent book, making this story of Irene Gut very easy to read ...that is, despite the horrible incidents that are described. The real life story of Irene Gut dwarfs fiction.As a student nurse in September 1939 when the German Wehrmacht attacked Poland, she was quickly "drafted" into a Polish Army unit where she was helping the wounded when Poland surrendered. Thereafter, she was raped by Soviet soldiers, held in a Soviet hospital, escaped into German-occupied Poland and the story continues down more horrible paths. Because Miss Gut looked Germanic, and could speak German, she was able to slip back into the German-occupied Poland where she was put to work serving a Major Eduard R&uuml;gemer, an older officer. Her position, however, permits her to protect first, her sister, and, then later, a number of Jewish refugees.What I found interesting was that the book relates that there were some Germans, such as the cook, Schulz, who were willing to turn a blind eye to the "crime" of helping the Jews. There were other Germans, such as the Major, who used helping the Jews to his advantage ... as in his relationship with Irene. And, of course, there were Germans, such the SS officer, Rokita, who just wanted to kill Jews. Irene Gut wonders aloud why the Germans wasted resources on eliminating the Jews when the same trains, etc. could have been used to supply German soldiers at the front.Even after liberation by the Red Army, Irene has to run since she was a member of the partisan Polish army, and they were being hunted down and killed by the Soviets. She finally ends up in New York City, where she again meets the American, William Opdyke, whom she marries in November 1956. Irene was honored as on of the "Righteous at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial with an olive tree.

"The Longest Winter" by Alex Kersahw. Sub-titled:" The Battle Of The Bulge And The Epic Story Of World War II's Most Decorated Platoon", Da Capo Press, 2004The author, Alex Kershaw, has done much research on the men of the I & R platoon, which bore the brunt of the German thrust on December 16th 1944. His book recounts the actions of the platoon as they attempted to prevent the advance of so many Germans on that cold winter day as World War II slipped down into its last few months. Kershaw then charts the history of the men of the platoon, as they surrender, are captured and are transported into nazi Germany and POW camps. The strength of this book lies in the personal memories of the men involved, as related to Mr. Kershaw. As with any other historical work, there is only so many ways that the personal words can be reported, so, if you have read many other books on the Battle of the Bulge, you will have probably seen the same exact quote elsewhere.This book, however, goes beyond the days of struggle in December 1994, and examines the trials and travails of each man, all of them wounded, as they surrender, are captured and then are roughly transported to Germany. Each one of them thought that they were shortly to be shot, by the SS, no doubt. Each man had his own wounds to deal with. Each was worried about the response of the folks back home when that dreaded telegram arrived. Kershaw brings all of that to life, some 60 years or so after the facts.The author fleshes out the book with stories about Hitler and the Bulge being his last shot, the actions and later death of Jochen Peiper, and the bombing of cities near the POW camps. There are some mistakes in this area, as the other reviewers have pointed out. On page 180, for example, someone left the umlaut off the German word "funf" (= five), but then my computer will not let me put umlauts, the two dots, on any words. I use a black pen when I have to. These errors should not put you off from reading this excellent book.

"In For A Penny, In For A Pound" by Howard Hewer, sub-titled: "The Adventures And Misadventures Of A Wireless Operator In bomber Command". Stoddard Publishing, Toronto, Canada, 2000.This book recounts the experiences of T. W. H. Hewer as a young man and a wireless operator in the Royal Canadian Air Force. As a young teenager, Howard Hewer had dreams of flying Spitfires, so he enlisted in the Canadian Air Force, which decided, at that moment, they had a greater need for radio operators than for pilots. He was shipped to Calgary for training in radio operations. Hewer then tells the story of his training as an enlisted radio operator, and his experience during bombing raids on Nazi held Europe. He retired as Wing Commander.Young Hewer was well aware of the cultural differences between the British and the Canadians. He devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 6, "Yatesbury Wireless School - Collision of Cultures) to describe the class-conscious Brits and the young Canadians being trained in England. Throughout the book, these cultural differences will pop up, and, in some instances, be of major importance. In Chapter 19, (A Fine Line To Mutiny), it would appear that the British wanted a level of discipline that neither the Australians nor the Canadians wanted to accept. Admittedly, it as an Australian who first threw down his rifle and refused to drill, but Hewer appears to have approved of the group's refusal to exercise and drill. He later implies that this "mutiny" was responsible for the delay of his commissioning as an officer.This book is not just the usual recounting of the terrors of flying bombers into German held Europe. There is that, of course, but Hewer narrates a story that involves the European Theatre, flying to Malta, on to Egypt and then a trip, in a ship, around Africa. In South Africa, when warned to avoid certain down town areas because the Boers still remembered the Boer war and therefore were "hostile" to the British, Hewer relies on his "Canada" shoulder flash. He and a Canadian compatriot slip into a down town hotel and are feted by the old Boers with free beer and lunch.An interesting anecdote related by Hewer deals with the dance halls. He was on a balcony and looked down at the dancers, who reminded him of a field of moving daisies. . It seems that the ladies had all used peroxide to become blondes and their roots were slowly growing out in their darker colors. As Hewer glanced down, the whirling locks appeared as daisies in the wind. This remembrance, alone, makes the book worth reading.

"Christmastime Is Cookie Time", by William Boniface, Illustrated by Ronnie Rooney.,Price, Stern, Sloan, 2001.This is a wonderful little book to keep the attention of the young ones while they are waiting for Santa and you are making Christmas cookies. William Boniface has again written lively verse, describing the annual family holiday task of making batches of sugar cookies to enjoy while celebrating Christmas. Ronnie Rooney has provided beautiful and bright "cookies", which the children can place into the correct slots of the board by each page.I bought this book for my grandchildren and watched as my daughter, their mother, made the sugar cookies. Some cookies were a little too well done, and they were used for my tea, but the others, when cooled, were frosted by many willing hands. The book's cookies were miniatures of the baked cookies. The book illustrator has based the cardboard cookies on the design of cookie cutters that have been in use for more than 30 years, perhaps 50 years. Therefore, the children use the book's cardboard cookies the same as, or at least very similar, to the cookies being baked in the oven. The Christmas colors used by the illustrator are bright enough to match the verse by William Boniface,"Since no two snowflakes are the same,We've made ours all unique,""And sprinkled them with powdered sugar.Come and take a peek".Take a peek at that page and see the powdered sugar suspended in mid-air by the artist: it is truly being sprinkled on the cookies! From personal experience, this Grandfather would recommend this book with five stars.

&#65533;If You Take A Mouse To The Movies&#65533; by Laura Numeroff, with Illustrations by Felicia Bond, A Laura Geringer Book, 2000.This is an excellent continuation of the collaboration of Laura Numeroff and Felicia Bond on children&#65533;s books based upon fanciful &#65533;IF/THEN&#65533; statements. If you take a Mouse to the movies, then he will want popcorn; THEN, this results in his stringing the popcorn to decorate the Christmas Tree (which is the central theme of this beautiful book), and then, and so on. Each improbable &#65533;THEN&#65533; is the joy of this book. For example, the little Mouse is given just the right clothes for the wintry weather, including a cute red woolen cap, with holes for his large ears. Finally, after making snowmen, decorating a Christmas Tree, you will come full circle, and, after giving the Mouse another batch of popcorn, again, &#65533;&#65533;he&#65533;ll want you to take him to the moves&#65533;.I enjoyed reading this book to my grandchildren. The younger boys (twins) were captivated by the richness of details in Felicia. Bond&#65533;s illustrations, while the older grandchildren (especially the girl) rolled their eyes at the &#65533;silliness&#65533; of each new IF/THEN situation &#65533;for example, a Mouse making a &#65533;snowman&#65533; and (!) with snowy white mouse ears! The Christmas theme makes this an ideal gift for the impending holidays.

"The Bishop In The West Wing" by Andrew M. Greeley, 8 Cassettes, Audio Renaissance 2002.There is a saying, "There are two kinds of people: the Irish and those that wish they were." The author, Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, may have used this saying for a theme in his this latest mystery. The newly elected president,an Irish Catholic, Jack McGurn, from Chicago, surrounds himself with a close staff that is Irish Catholic, and, artistic license,(patently) they are all portrayed as beautiful, bright, and filled with witty anecdotes and stories. The major exception in the close staff is an Italian Catholic Ph.D. from Brooklyn, the resident expert on China. Everything would be fine (except for the opposition of the usual Republicans and right wing radicals) but there is a poltergeist in the White House.Fr. Greeley defines the poltergeist as a presence that causes a ruckus but does no real physical harm. (I checked on the Web, and there are plenty of examples where the poltergeist presence typically does some nasty physical things... example, biting a young girl on the behind and leaving teeth wounds.) But any way, artistic license again, (patently) and this White House poltergeist just throws things around; nothing or no one is hurt. She is constantly knocking down the portrait of George Washington in the West Wing. Bishop Blackie has to figure out which woman, of nine potential candidates, is the cause of all the ruckus. This is the central mystery in the book. By the way, all the candidates are beautiful, and all are Catholic, except the least good looking, a WASP with angular features. By the last cassette, the "elevator doors have opened" and the good Bishop has identified the culprit woman (patently).Paul Michael did a great job on reading the book, with accents for all the characters, although I think that he only approximated a New York accent, not a Brooklyn accent, for lady Ph.D. expert on China. In my writing conferences, I am constantly being taught to throw out any thing, no matter how well I've written it, that does not advance the central theme or the plot. So, I do not understand why Fr. Greeley spent so much time on the conversation (almost an altercation) between the character of President McGurn and the bishop of Washington, DC. It advanced nothing in the story. Same thing with the references to stealing the Presidential election in Florida (in 2000). I counted at least three mentions. Finally, besides being a noted author, Andrew Greeley is an established sociologist. In that role, I would expect him to take notice of the fact that many Irish Catholics from big cities are no longer Democrats. As an Irish Catholic from NYC, I once was a Democrat. My oldest daughter came home from college and convinced me to register Republican (in Massachusetts!). My daughter and I and the other three children in the family are all Republicans. Sociologist Greeley should be aware of this shift in the newer generations of Irish Catholics.

"People Of Darkness" by Tony Hillerman. Thorndike Press, Thorndike, Maine, 1980.Spoiler Alert.... Spoiler AlertThis is one of the early Jim Chee novels by Tony Hillerman (1925-2008). Jim Chee is depicted as a successful member of the Navajo Tribal Police, and he is faced with a career choice at the same time as an old mass murder mystery and present day killer-for-hire come together in Navajo territory. What once appeared as a terrible industrial accident (nitro glycerin was involved), turns out to be a mass killing to hide the presence of uranium ore. The author has written the book so that you do not discover this until the last few chapters. As the character of Jim Chee is developed, and, as he attempts to understand the white man's ways, you are exposed to the Navajo world outlook: "hozho", where beauty, harmony and the interconnectedness of the natural world are paramount. Interestingly, Joe Leaphorn is hardly mentioned in this novel.So, as Jim Chee investigates the old "accident", he is being considered for a position with the FBI in Virginia, and, also, he is considering beginning training as a Navajo medicine man, a "singer". One decision takes him ever so deeply into the white man's world, while the other immerses him more deeply in the Navajo way. "You couldn't be a Navajo away from the People". While this personal crisis is occurring, Jim Chee is being stalked by the man with blond hair, the professional killer.Chee's investigation brings him, and his Anglo acquaintance, the teacher, Mary Landon, into harm's way, when the professional killer shots at both of them. Mary Landon's ability with Chee's rifle drives away the professional killer (temporarily) but Chee is wounded. This results in Jim Chee being in the hospital, where Hillerman's excellent writing depicts a frightening stalking scene. You know that the Navajo policeman can not be killed, because the book would end, but you don't see how he is going to escape. Good writing.More detective work by the recuperating Chee leads to more assassination attempts and a rescue of Chee and Mary Landon by a pipe-line surveillance helicopter. A note to the killer left by Chee on the killer's windshield directs the killer to the person who was paying for all the deaths. Chee and Landon follow the killer's truck (through the New Mexico SNOW!) The originator, of both the old accident and the hiring of the professional killer, is shot dead by that self same killer. Chee takes off his boots, and begins a room by room search to find the wounded killer. The wound is fatal. And, you'll never guess who shot the killer.Enjoy the book.

"Colditz", by Henry Chancellor, sub-titled "The Untold Story of World War II's Great Escapes". William Morrow, 2001.This is a lengthy and well-documented book, telling the story of the "recalcitrant" Allied prisoners who were remanded to Colditz Castle in eastern Germany during World War II. The purpose of using Colditz castle as a prison camp was, as is well known, to provide a camp from which no prisoner could escape. As a last resort, "recalcitrant" prisoners, who had already shown a strong inclination to escape from other camps of the Nazis, were transferred to Colditz, deep in the eastern reaches of the Reich. The theory was that the prisoners could not get out of the high castle and, even if they did, they had great distances between them and freedom. Of course, all these efforts did not work, and Henry Chancellor spins 391 pages of the tales of the many different escape schemes. He devotes an Appendix, of eleven pages, to listing the names of he prisoners who attempted to escape , their methods, and the results. Overall, Mr. Chancellor lists "...316 officers involved in 174 attempts"... with 32 successful escapes, i.e. reaching freedom in neutral or Allied countries. Perhaps the most unbelievable scheme was the actual construction of a glider in the chapel attic, for escape by using the winds caused by the castle's location in the mountains. Chancellor documents this effort with photographs of the actual glider.The book is an even-handed treatment of all nationalities involved; the author even-goes so far as to interviewing the German guards who served at Colditz. Polish POWs were first imprisoned at Colditz castle, and then, along with the fortunes of war, came French and British officers. Much of the story is about these three groups. Years ago, as a young boy, I had read Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape", and I was later surprised by the (artistic license)changes made in the picture of the same name. In this book, however, Americans are noted, but Americans played a minor role as they arrived too late in the war for any escape attempts.Since this book is based upon a television documentary, there are three batches of interesting photos. Overall, the book is well written and interesting.

"Foo, A Japanese-American Prisoner Of The Rising Sun" by Frank "Foo" Fujita, with Stanley L. Falk. Subtitled: "The Secret Prison Dairy of Frank "Foo" Fujita". University of North Texas Press, 1993.This is an interesting book on many different levels. First, it is the story of a World War II Prisoner Of War. But not just any POW: Frank "Foo" Fujita was a Japanese-American, perhaps the only Japanese-American who was held as a POW in Japan. And, on the third level, "Foo" was a Texan and a member of the Texas National Guard. His unit was called up, to be sent to the south Pacific, and, after the sneak attack, on Pearl Harbor, they were diverted to Australia. The 2nd Battalion, 131st field Artillery was assigned to the defense of the Dutch island of Java, where they were overrun by the Japanese. Most of us have forgotten the American units that were part of the ABDA, American, British, Dutch and Australian forces in this theater, with, perhaps the major exception being the cruiser, the U.S. S. Houston. (See, for example, pages 345-346, where a contemporary "bird-colonel" does not believe that Fujita's unit was never in the Pacific.)To make the story even more interesting, Sergeant Fujita was an accomplished sketch artist, and he includes contemporary drawings of himself and of the Japanese mistreating POWs. So, on this level, he has enhanced his story visually. His entire diary was in a code of his own fabrication. His diary and his drawings were hidden in a wall of a building in his POW camp; the diary and drawings were recovered after the war. This recovered material makes this book a primary source for the history of Japanese-held POWs.Excellent primary source supported by explanatory notes supplied by Stanley L. Falk.

"Sky", by Hanneke Ippisch. Subtitled: "A True Story Of Resistance During World War II." Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers, New York, 1996.The number of works on the Resistance in Belgium, Denmark and The Netherlands are few and far between; so, I was happy to see this personal memoir by Hanneke Ippisch about the Dutch Resistance. It is a concise and sweet autobiography of one woman inside the Dutch Resistance.Time wise, the author's resistance story actually begins with May 10 1940: the "Sitzkrieg" turned again into the "Blitzkrieg" and Belgium and The Netherlands had soon capitulated. Hanneke Ippisch records how she and her family were awakened by the drone of heavy bombers and then everything changed. From page 17 to page 138, she tells the story of her involvement with the Dutch Resistance, support for the Jews, her own arrest, her interrogation and finally, her release just before the end of the war in Europe.I found her writing to be direct and informative as she describes events that occurred. Contemporary black & white photos illustrate the book throughout. As the author said in her preamble, she was now seventy and ..." I cannot find the excuses to postpone this any longer." Nicely done.

"Voice Of The Violin" by Andrea Camilleri, "An Inspector Montalbano Mystery". Translated by Stephen Sartarelli. Viking Penguin, 2003.I was introduced to the Inspector Montalbano series by the comments of other Amazon reviewers. Thank you. This novel deals with the murder of a beautiful young lady in Sicily, and the story takes quite a few twists and turns, before the crime is finally solved in the last chapter. The author uses dialogue to continuously advance the story line, and, every now and then, uses the fractured dialogue of Catarella as comic relief. For example, Catarella is assigned to study the new technology, computers, which he calls "pewters".Part of the novel is devoted to the young , educated and rising generation of new police inspectors and the conflict between them and the old-guard. And, of course, food consumes a substantial part of the book; (it WAS written by an Italian). There are descriptions of what Inspector Salvo Montalbano is expecting for lunch, what the other officers will be consuming, and the difference between northern Italian cuisine and southern Italian. In all of this, the "Voice Of The Violin" almost disappears, but in the end of the book, you will read how the violin plays a central part in the plot and in the crimes that were committed.In the back of the book, there is an interesting glossary of sorts (pp. 245-249), where "in-phrases" are explained. For example, "baby octopus alla Luciana" ... is described as ..."a simple dish, ...octopi are cooked in a spicy tomato sauce with garlic and hot pepper". All in all, this is an appetizing book.

"Clash Of The Carriers". By Barrett Tillman. Subtitled: "The True Story Of The Marianas Turkey Shoot Of World War II."NAL Caliber, Penguin Group, 2005.Barrett Tillman has been the author of quite a few books, fiction and non-fiction, dealing with naval aviation and the war in the Pacific. His non-fiction books are filled to overflowing with technical details about carrier aircraft (e.g. "Hellcat: The F6F In World War II"), and some of his books have been published by the prestigious U. S. Naval Institute Press. With this background, Barrett Tillman has crafted an exacting detailed history of the naval battle of the "Marianas Turkey Shoot", the popular name for the Battle of the Philippines Sea, June 19-20, 1944.Barrett Tillman has drawn upon both American and Japanese sources to describe both sides of this naval battle. His main thesis is that this was the battle in which Japanese naval aviation was utterly destroyed. After this battle, Japanese naval aviation, whose attack on Pearl Harbor had started the Second World War for the United States, played a minor role in the rest of the war. In the main portion of the book, Tillman continuously records the numbers of how Japanese naval aviation was destroyed and again in the interesting appendices at the back of the book. (See, in particular, Appendix F.)Beyond all the dry records and the technical details, the author has the ability to make the men and their human concerns come alive. This is particularly evident in the book's Part Five, entitled, "Turn On The Lights", in which he describes the agonized decision to turn on the running lights of the fleet so that the pilots could locate the American ships in the dark. This, of course, made the same ships better targets for any Japanese submarines.Finally, I looked up the term "white hat", which is defined as "... an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy". As a former "white hat", I can tell you that I would only wear a white hat with my undress whites, but I could wear either a white hat or a flat hat with my dress blues. I think that an interested novice reader can figure that out. All in all, this book makes it clear that the author is an avid supporter of the United Sates Navy.

Beautiful Little Book."Christmas". Subtitled: "A Celebration In Words And Paintings". Selected by Helen Exley.Exley Publications, New York 1994.Although this book is as small as a pocket book, it is hard bound. The book appears to be designed as "stocking stuffer" for Christmas morning. Even the book's covers are in the Christmas colors: bright red (cranberry?) covers, with deep green insets.This Christmas theme continues throughout the book. There are woodland vistas, city scenes and so many Christmas decorations. Interspersed among all the photos are concise quotations, from well known individuals (Charles Dickens, Mark Twain) to lesser known writers. Some of the writings hit home:"The angel did not call blessing down on all good people -but on people of goodwill."Pam Brown, b. 1928."Christmas is the only day when children get up early without being told to."Simon Morgan, Age 10.This little book, if unwrapped early on Christmas morning, has enough little stories and bright pictures to make the whole Holiday even more festive and enjoyable. Nice present!!

You Will Be Amazed."The Incorruptibles" by Joan Carroll Cruz, Tan Books and Publishers, Rockford, Illinois,On the very first page of her introduction, Joan Cruz specifies that she understands that she is treating a very special case in the preservation of the bodies of saints. First, she notes that there are three classifications of preserved bodies: (1) deliberately preserved, (2) accidentally preserved and (3) the incorruptibles. Ancient Egyptian mummies are probably the most familiar examples of deliberately preserved bodies; many of us have seen them in various museums. In her introduction, Ms. Cruz presents more details than most of us want to know about the modern techniques of embalming and its impact on the body of the deceased.(Pages 27 to 32).Accidentally preserved bodies include the more or less well known cases of bodies found in peat bogs in Denmark, Ireland and Scotland (page 32). Ms. Cruz presents the interesting case of Bremen Cathedral, Germany, where the cellar burial place tends to mummify any body left there. Experiments were run using the bodies of animals or fowls, hung in the open-windowed cellar, and the bodies of these animals became mummified.The incorruptibles, however, are those bodies which have been preserved only since Christian times and their preservation is ..."even more baffling..." since it "...seems to be neither dependent upon the manner of burial nor on the temperature or place of interment". Joan Cruz makes a case for the intervention of God as a sign of favor to His saints. The mystery is "...further compounded ... (with) ...the observance of blood and clear oils" which flow from these incorruptibles. (Page 27). Her introduction to the book is a clear and pressing statement as to why the 100+ cases she presents are different from mummifying the bodies or from accidental preservation.After her excellent introduction, Joan Cruz then presents, in chronological order, slightly more than a hundred documented cases of individuals whose bodies had been preserved from corruption after their death. In many of the cases, she provides photographs of the dead bodies, with, perhaps, the most striking and the most beautiful being that of the nun and saint, St. Bernadette Soubirous, (1844-1879), whose body has been preserved intact, "...without embalming or other artificial means", since 1879. This is a wonderful book, which will make anyone think again on his mortality, if the book is read with an open mind.

"The Vanished Kingdom" By James Charles Roy. Subtitled: "Travels Through The History Of Prussia". Westview Press, 1999.I first was acquainted with James Charles Roy when I read some of his books on Ireland; see, for example: "The Fields Of Athenry: A Journey through Ireland, 2001". More than 50 years ago, I studied the German language, and the "culture" sections exposed me to those forever gone places: Prussia, East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia. Also, that small city-state whose postage stamps I collected: Memel. So, I was quite happy to see Roy's book, "The Vanished Kingdom".James Charles Roy has written an excellent and eloquent book tracing the history of the lands way east, well beyond the Oder and the Elbe rivers. The author goes back to the early Crusades to trace the beginnings of what later became Prussia, and develops the story into more modern times, with Napoleon, and then the Franco Prussian War, Bismark and the Kaiser (William II) and, of course, the two world wars. Interspersed with all this history, Mr. Roy makes personal observations of the present conditions in the lands the book discusses. He spends substantial time on Koenigsberg, the present day Kaliningrad, which, by the way, still employs Russian postage stamps and is nominally Russian. The author is impressed with Koenigsberg's philosopher, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Sorry, Mr. Roy, since I went to a Catholic college, Kant was a footnote to St. Thomas Aquinas.My fellow Amazon reviewers appear to be of two minds on this book. Those with German-sounding names want to emphasize the recovery of the lost lands to the East. The others want to emphasize the poor opinion the author presents for the Poles he met on his journey. I would remind my Polish co-religionists that James Charles Roy had travelled extensively throughout Ireland where he was undoubtedly met with Irish hospitality: Cead Milte Failte....literally, A Hundred Thousand Welcomes. His journal of this journey shows that the Poles he encountered were not that hospitable; they therefore became fair game for this reporting. I know that the author believes that they were mistakenly identified him as German, and this raised some animosity. I can understand that, but the benefit of the doubt should have been given. Since I have blue eyes, a fair skin, and once had blond hair, I encountered the same animosity at some oil refineries in Europe, especially since my Dutch had a German accent. When I replied that I was of Irish descent, everyone was again all smiles. By the way, I wonder how many of them could pronounce "Athenry" correctly.I suggest that this is a fair and eloquent book that deserves five stars.

"In The Wake of the Plague", by Norman F. Cantor. The Free Press, 2001 The cover of this book aroused my interest. I began reading the book, but stopped when I found that Norman Cantor had spun his wheels in too many places. As with many American historians, Mr. Cantor spends too much time (in my humble opinion) on the effects of the plague on the British Isles. Wouldn't it be nice to hear what happened, in, for example, Warsaw? While dealing with the black plague in England, however, Mr. Cantor appears to be proposing an interesting thesis: (see pages 11 to 17), that the plague's killing power was enhanced by the presence of another disease, anthrax. Anthrax is common in sheep rising lands. For example, (P. 13), "...death that occurred within three or four days of incubation"; far too rapid for just the black plague. On page 15, Cantor reports that the "...excavation yielded three anthrax spores from a cesspool into which human waste was discharged". BUT!, and it is big, Mr. Cantor does not explain if this spore presence is good, bad or indifferent as far as advancing the theory of the synergy of anthrax and the plague. Why bring up all of this at this point in the book? Why expect the common reader ( I have degrees in engineering and History) to understand if "three anthrax spores " was a big deal? Or does this happen ordinarily? Daily in sheep country? I scanned the book, but stopped reading when Mr. Cantor named the "Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in eastern England" as the "...greatest proletarian rising before the eighteenth century". (P. 24). I wonder if Dr. Martin Luther would consider that English uprising greater than the Peasants' War he witnessed in Germany and Austria in 1524-1525? Or was that Germanic uprising of the common people not "proletarian" enough? This book could benefit from the efforts of a good editor, to bring the work together, with some few central thesis statements clearly presented in the early structure of the book. Please forgive me, I am beginning to sound like my advisor when I wrote my MA History thesis!

WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? ROBERT M. McMATH This book is about more than just Marketing, although the sub-title is, "Marketing Lessons I've Learned from over 80,000 New-Product Innovations and Idiocies".Robert McMath has produced a commentary on the History of the industrial complex of the United States and much of the Western world. On page 45 he states, "I miss the civility. I miss the sense of loyalty people felt to colleagues and their companies". He also laments "... that widespread downsizing is resulting in brand managers who are repeating yesterday's mistakes because they and their organizations are totally unaware of the history of their products". (p.45). This is true not only in marketing organizations but also in engineering firms. On page 69, the author notes that America is really not a "melting pot" but the more appropriate metaphor should be a "salad bowl". You will find such sociological comments throughout the book.The book is arranged by alphabetical order of topics. Generally, I avoid such books since it is similar to reading a dictionary. The author, however, has been successful in writing a connected story about marketing that stretches from "a", "ABRACADABRA" to "z", "ZETIGEISTS". The book is about more than just marketing and is well worth your time.

"Wreaking Havoc" by Joseph W. Rutter, Sub-titled, "a Year In An A-20". Texas A&amp; M University Press, 2004.For many of us who were young boys during World War II, or directly after, the most famous aircraft were the big bombers: the B17 "Flying Fortress", the B24 "Liberator" and the B29 "Superfortress". The relatively small A20 "Havoc" was hardly mentioned.This book corrects that ommission. Joseph Rutter flew the A20 "Havoc" in some 64 combat missions in the A20 in the Pacific Theatre. The author lists all 64 missions on pages xv through xxi in the preface to the his book , which is quite a personal memoir of his war. The book actually starts with his father getting the author out of bed "...at 6 A.M. on Sunday, September 3, 1939 to listen to Great Britain's declaration of war on Germany..." Page 8. The author then tells of growing up, graduating high school, going to work for the FBI, and then leaving for flight school. He learned to fly both the B25 "Mitchell" and the A20 "Havoc", but it is apparent, in my humble opinion, that Mr. Rutter really loved the A20 the best.The book presents many details about the A20, with pictures scattered appropriately throughout the book. On page 105, the photo shows a pilot, Maury Owen, seated in an A20 cockpit. It is a tight fit. A big person, (say, the actor John Wayne, for easy identification), could never fit in the standard A20 cockpit. Rutter gives many somewhat technical details about flying the A20, including setting the manifold pressure to prevent backfiring of the engines, how to lean the gas mixture to fly the maximum distance and the proper method of firing the guns to prevent jams, and all of this material makes you understand in small fashion what it was like to live and fly in the Pacific War. Since the author was able to develop many of the pictures he snapped , he was able to bring the photos home with him. Therefore, the book is nicely illustrated with contemporary photos , including, for example, the village church at Dagupan, Luzon, the Philippines. (Page 184).If you want a complete story of what it was like, flying and fighting in the Pacific Theater in World War II, this book is an excellent choice.

"On Time, On Target" by John McKenzieThis is another excellent personal memoir, written some 50 years later, by an individual who served in the chaos and destruction that was the Second World War. In this book, John McKenzie traces the advance of the Allied Army from the Normandy Beaches to the capture of Berlin. McKenzie, a chemical engineer in later life (who says engineers can't write!?) describes his efforts as a forward observer with the famous 82nd Airborne. His writing is mater-of-fact , as, on page 23, he states that "(t)here I learned what triage meant". Priority was given to the seriously wounded who had the best chance of recovery, while the lightly wounded were treated last. His description of the dead is limited to quiet testimony about "even more bodies and carnage than we had seen thus far". Page 24.McKenzie has nothing but praise for airborne troopers, who generally had an "...IQ about ten points higher than the army minimum" (P. 39) and were required to be in top-notch physical condition before being accepted as airborne. In many ways, the author echoes writers who have described the obvious effectiveness of elite troops, such as the U.S. Marines. (See "Breakout" by Martin Russ). McKenzie clearly considers the 82nd Airborne to have "...superior efficiency" (p. 39) , performing consistently with excellence.There are some interesting personal observations such as the size of the German tanks in Normandy , the effects of the "Buzz bombs" on London and the effectiveness of the Sherman tank as compared to the German Panther and Tiger tanks (p. 115). McKenzie sums up the weakness of the Sherman with "Since they usually wound up dead in single tank combat, our tankers developed swarming and flanking tactics that gave them shots against the panzers' more vulnerable side and rear armor" (p. 116) He makes a small comment that epitomizes the lack of understanding of the superiority of the German weapons, "We wondered if our ordnance people had paid any attention at all to the war in North Africa." "...we figured the state of our arms and ordnance should have been far advanced from what it was in late 1944." (P. 117). Finally, the author describes the trip home after the war, by train through `Belgium and then by ship across the Atlantic. Typically, this last part is omitted by many others telling their personal memoirs, so McKenzie's story is appreciated. Overall, this book is well written personal history of an important Army unit in the European theatre.

Infantry Soldier by George W. Neill: This is an exceedingly well-written by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge ( December 1944). Mr. Neill, a retired newspaper editor, has put together three separate accounts of that battle. (1) On the first level, it is a personal recounting of the hardships and terror he experienced as a rifleman in a company of the 99th Infantry Division on the northern shoulder of the "Bulge". (2). On the second level, it is a somewhat truncated story of the ASTP: the Army Specialized Training Program, which Mr. Neill claims was "... the largest single college training program the U.S. government ever implemented"... p. 23. (3) The third level is his view of the officers and the commanding generals. He points out the ridiculous remedy that General Dwight D. Eisenhower offered for trench foot, a serious ailment when the troops are continuously exposed to wet mud in the bottom of their trenches. In fact, my opinion of General (later President) Eisenhower was lowered quite a bit by the comments of veteran George W. Neill. Further, there is no love lost between Author Neill and Army's officer corps.`In his little asides near the end of each chapter Author Neill has hit upon a method of keeping the story moving: he summarizes "On Our Side" in a brief paragraph and then presents the German view in "On The Other Side". This is a nice way of avoiding looking up the actual history of each day and names of the major participants. One interesting comment is the description of the sparkling silver strips that "decorated" many of the fir trees near his foxhole. He describes these strips as "window" or "chaff", the strips of aluminum dropped by Allied aircraft to reflect German radar signals back to their receivers, and mask the approaching waves of Allied bombers. I have wondered what happened to these strips when they hit the ground.This book is well worth reading.

"Brothers In Arms" by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton. Subtitled "The Epic Story Of The 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes". Broadway books, New York, 2004.Studying History gives you exposure to the overall events of World War II, and the general ebb and flow of the European Theater of Operations, such as which unit attacked which enemy unit and the results. After an MA in History, I am always seeking more interesting personal accounts, i.e. personal reminiscences, describing what really happened. This book, "Brothers In Arms", appeared to be just that: the personal memoirs of black soldiers in a tank battalion in the EOT, with all those daily minimal details, woven into a real and personal story of the men who served. Even more interesting, these soldiers were black.Unfortunately, however, the book did not live up to its promise. The stories about the individuals involved, with the possible exception of Leonard "Smitty" Smith, did not, in my humble opinion, bring those individuals alive. Even the nice repetition , (but disrupting to the continuity of the book), of Baseball's Jackie Robinson's wartime experiences were not truly a personal remembrance.Then there are the unnecessary mistakes. As other reviewers have mentioned the worst gaffe, the German word for panther, is "Panther" and "Panzer" means, basically, armor or tanks. See page 47. The Luftwaffe's rotund Hermann Goering is probably rotating rapidly in his grave since this book identifies him as the skinny Nazi propaganda minister. On page 45, the authors state that in the Pacific theater, in 1942, "American and Japanese forces were at a stalemate". Sorry! The Battle of Midway, June 1942, was the turning point and it was downhill for Japan after that. The "stalemate" characterization was wrong. On page 70, the authors have General George S. Patton being born in 1895; he was born in 1885. Just as another example, the book states that the German "Teller" Anti-Tank mines had about one pound of explosive in them. I could not understand why a "Teller" mine should threaten a Sherman tank, so I went on the Web. There I found that the early models of the German Teller mines had about 23 pounds, or about ten kilograms, of explosive. I could see that this concentrated explosive force could do damage to some parts of the Sherman. My complaint is the book's authors let this poundage gaffe go into print.So , for the personal memoirs, I gave four stars. For the mistakes , (too many!) and evident lack of knowledge about the History of the EOT, I gave zero stars. Average: two stars.

"Burn-in" by Finn Jensen and Niels Erik Petersen. Sub-titled: "An Engineering Approach To The Design And Analysis Of Burn-in Procedures". John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1986.The main purpose of this book is to provide an organized approach to the development and implementation of a burn-in program. This book does give you the basics in developing burn-in, that is the application of elevated temperature to cause latent defects to fail at the manufacturing plant rather than to have the unit fail during use by the Customer. The book, however, is truly a rather complete text in reliability, dealing with the three stages of a product: infant mortality, useful life and wear out.I have used this book over the past decade or so, and taken portions of the text for proposals, when a project was just beginning, and, at the other end, used the text for Weibull functions to ascertain the end-of-life of a product. It is an excellent book, describing reliability principles far more clearly than some other fundamental texts.I received this book at a burn-in seminar taught by Dr. Finn Jensen. Dr. Jensen is a slight, bubbly man, whose English is impeccable. At the seminar, he fleshed out the examples in the book with details and anecdotes showing that the book, "Burn-In", is grounded on a wealth of real-life experience. If you buy one book on burn-in, or on reliability, this is the one.John Peter Rooney, MSEE; ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.

"Before Their Time" by Robert Kotlowitz. Subtitled: "A Memoir".Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. New York, 1997.In 1943, Robert Kotlowitz was in the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) at the University of Maine when mounting casualties in the European Theater of Operation (ETO) required fresh men for the war. General George Marshall ordered the termination of ASTP program so as to release some 175,000 young soldiers to the battlefields of Europe. So, this young man from Baltimore found himself on the liner, "Argentina", at the city of Cherbourg, "...the old Norman city" in France. The soldiers of the 26th division, the old Yankee Division, had to climb down rope ladders, hanging on the hull of the ship, into Higgins boats below. The details of this relatively unimportant event... i.e. disembarkation, fill many pages in this small book of memories written many years after the war. In this small section, the recounts how his contemporaries reacted to the requirement of climbing down rope cargo nets into the boats below, and by so writing, analyzes those young men of the Yankee Division.The author not only analyzes the men but also the 26th Division.On page 8, he writes ..."By 1944 there were no longer many true Yankees in the Yankee division. (O)ther ethnic and national groups had begun to infiltrate the roster:,, Italians, ... Armenians, Greeks" ... and so on. Then, Kotlowitz notes that there was "... a substantial cluster of despised WASPs, who didn't yet know that they were a symptom of the future, as well as a handful of isolated Jews, who were also despised; but the unlike the WASPs, the Jews were quite used to it".The writing continues in this analytical tone until the day when his regiment, the 104th, was ordered to advance against the German lines. Almost everyone was killed or wounded. Kotlowitz was one of the few physically unharmed survivors; he spent the entire day under the sights of the Germans. He did not move and played dead. This affected his outlook on the war and on the army and on his future life. After this single day of terrible combat, where so many casualties were caused by incompetence, Private Kotlowitz was assigned to rear-echelon job. Safe for the duration. So, unlike many World War II memoirs, this book is not a bang-bang, shoot `em story. Rather, it is a sensitive and subtle analysis of the experiences of one American soldier.

Between Tedium And Terror" by Sy M. Kahn. Subtitled: "A Soldier's World War II Diary, 1943-1945". University Of Illinois Press, 1993.The writing is excellent which is remarkable since it seems that the book is a verbatim copy of the diaries that Sy Kahn wrote, under stress, more than sixty years ago in the Pacific. The author has included some photo copies of his original, hand-written diaries, and the corresponding text appears to be an exact copy of what he had written during the war. As an engineer, I have written more than 35 technical papers for the IEEE, and I have never been able to go with the first draft. Most writers go through many drafts, and, even then, are not satisfied.Sy Kahn barely mentions being born and raised in Manhattan (a small island in NYC), but goes directly to his subject matter, with his ship going under the Golden Gate Bridge, September 1943. The author evades a detailed description of basic training and gets directly to the heart of the matter: action in the Pacific. As he records in his introduction, writing and reading kept him sane over the next three years or so. As a result of his fidelity to his diary, we have this excellent book. He records that his outfit, the 244th Port Company, endured some three to four hundred air attacks, and being torpedoed and being shelled by shore guns. The frustration was that his outfit was not equipped to fire back and had to depend on others for their defense. "Thus we alternated between tedium and terror". (page xx).There are quite a few introspective entries, as Mr. Kahn was a young man, growing up in a restrictive environment, which, while challenging him physically, did not challenge him mentally. He was always looking to learn, (Page 102: "I learned much from the many people I spoke with") and used reading as both a means of learning and as escape from the tedium of "hurry up and wait". Kahn laments the fact that he never knew what it was to be a civilian between the ages of 18 and 21, but, in his later years, ironically, he spends his time teaching college students in the same age bracket.I liked this book, perhaps because I followed a path similar to Sy Kahn. Born and raised in Manhattan, a small island, I enlisted in the United States Navy after high school (in The Bronx) at the age of 17 years. I, too, could not see the big "E" on the eye chart. I spent much of my Navy time at Naval Air Station, Key West, which was hot enough to give me a nasty case of tropical boils. Unfortunately, I did not keep a diary. Sy Kahn has written a good book that fills in gaps in personal histories of individuals who fought in the Pacific in world War II.

"Lightning War" by Ronald E. Powaski. Sub-titled:" Blitzkrieg In The West, 1940"John Wiley & Sons, 2003.The author, Ronald E. Powaski, has produced a 388 paged book, rich in details about the May 1940 invasion of western countries by the Third Reich. He covers the usual facts: e.g. the adoption of the Schlieffen Plan, the delay of the actual invasion until May 10 1940, and the rapid disintegration of the allied forces. France surrendered in June 1940. All of these historical facts are well enough known, but Powaski provides more details than most books about this period. For example, he describes in detail the two German officers who crashed their aircraft in Belgium (at the time, 1939, neutral) while they were carrying the German plans for the invasion through Belgium. This, of course, resulted in the need to change the invasion plans which, in turn, evolved into the genesis of the Schlieffen plan. Besides describing and naming the German officers (details missed in most history books), the author also tells us that the two men spent the entire war in a POW camp in Canada. Interesting. But, more ironically, as punishment for the incident, their wives were also imprisoned inside the Third Reich.Duplicity of Churchill: I found, in my humble opinion, that the author tends to emphasize the duplicity of the British Prime Minister, Winston S. Churchill, during the time when the allied forces were engaging the German enemy and just prior to the actual surrender of France. Powaski pictures Churchill as waving his right hand and promising RAF squadrons to aid the French , while with his left hand (behind his back), he is motioning the BEF Commanding General, Lord John Gort, to get the British troops down to the sea and across the channel back home. Of course, after the German break through, evacuation at Dunkirk was all that was left to save the bulk of the British army. The chapter on the evacuation of the troops (Chapter Nine, "Operation Dynamo"), is one of the more interesting chapters in the book. Powaski records that many French soldiers were evacuated along with the British. When the French soldiers landed in England, they were immediately loaded on trains and sent to other ports (e.g. Plymouth) to be shipped back to France. These French troops arrived back in France in time for the defeat and in time to surrender to the Germans. This is an interesting detail you will not find in general history books. All in all, I found this to be a well written book.

"The Deadly Brotherhood" by John C. McManus. Subtitled: "The American Combat Soldier In World War II".Ballantine Books, New York 2003.The author, Historian John C. McManus, has worked diligently and has done a great deal of research to compile in one place the whole spectrum of experiences endured by the American combat soldier in World War II. He breaks the book into two parts, the first dealing with the environment, ("The World Of The Combat Soldier") and the second half of the book dealing with the human angle, ("The Soul Of The Combat Soldier"). Throughout this compendium, the author has condensed the feelings and experiences of the combat solider into brief anecdotes concerning the particular issue at hand. So, you will see comments from a soldier on how good the food was (see page 16) and then, remarks on how the American wounded were treated (see Chapter 6, "Becoming A Casualty"). John McManus does address the feelings of the American fighting man towards their German and Japanese enemies, and he compiles and condenses their comments in two separate chapters. A lot of work went into this book.Having said that, I would point out that, in my humble opinion, the author favors the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) and further, favors the United States Army. I do no think that he has done enough to understand the U. S. Marine. For example, on page 160, McManus quietly states that the term ..."'corpsman', as marines called medics" was used in the Pacific. First, "Marines" should always be capitalized. Secondly, McManus appears to miss the tradition of the U. S. Marines. As sea born soldiers, they would strike their target (say, the Barbary Pirates in 1803), and then return to their ships with the Marine wounded and dead. The Marines depended upon U. S. Navy personnel for medical attention...the "corpsman". One of the men raising the flag on Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima, February 23 1945, was a Navy corpsman. Finally, I do no think that the author mentions the orders of then Colonel "Chesty" Puller, USMC, concerning the treatment of Jap prisoners. It is in the biography of General Puller, whose face graced an American Postage Stamp in 2005. So, I would give this book four stars.

"God Is My Broker", by Brother Ty, with Christopher Buckley and John Tierney, Audio Cassette, Bantam Doubleday, 1998.This is a funny tape recording of the supposed self-help book, with "...the 7 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth", as written by a monk and previous Wall Street Stock Trader. Brother Ty cannot help his clients (or himself) to make any money on the market, so, he enters a monastery, where the claim to fame is making wine. Brother Ty wanted to conquer his drinking habit! When the Cana Monastery falls on hard financial times, Brother Ty turns to God and the monk's breviary to determine money-winning tips on the market. This is the first sub-plot in this complicated but funny book.The second sub-plot is based upon the first Miracle of our Lord at the Wedding Feast of Cana, where He changed water into wine at the request of His Mother, Mary. Since the monastery is called Cana, you can bet that someone (?Brother Abbot?) will be attempting his own version of the wine-making miracle: this time to keep Federal Agents happy. Then, there's the investigating Italian Monsignor, representing the Vatican and Cardinal "Blutspieler"; this urbane Italian, interested in soccer (at least when Milan is playing), is also a wine connoisseur. He really does not like his German boss, the Cardinal "Blood-player", and therefore the Italian settles in for a long stay at the Cana Monastery, which by now has hired a good-looking lady to deal with the necessary television advertising. Of course, the wine is not being made at the Cana Monastery, but being imported from Chile, which means that Brother Ty has to continuously check with his "broker" to get tips to pay for the imported wine, and the improvements at the monastery, and so on.The two, three, perhaps four sub-plots are tied together by the intermittent announcement of a pertinent law of "spiritual and financial" growth. One of the authors, or both, must have had training in the Catholic school system, since their comic references to Church affairs and internal politics, given with great reverence, are fairly accurate. This six hours tape recording helped me during many hours of heavy traffic on 495, the ring road around Boston.

As a person of Irish descent, I was very happy to see &quot;The Irish in America&quot;. This book is full of colorful illustrations showing what the Irish have accomplished in this country. I am referencing the book in my MA, History Thesis, this Autumn.On page 57, however, the editors have made an understandable error. They attribute the founding of Manhattan College (1853), De La Salle University (1863) and St. Mary's (Moraga, California, (1863) to the Irish Christian Brothers. As a 1965 graduate of Manhattan College, I can tell you that these three colleges were founded by the French Christian Brothers, also know as the De La Salle Brothers. This teaching order was founded in Paris by St. John Baptist de la Salle, and predates the Irish Christian Brothers by almost two hundred years. To my knowledge, the only college founded by the Irish Christian Brothers in the U.S. is Iona College (1940) in New York. Personally, I enjoyed the book, found new facts about the Irish in America, and would recommend it to any Irish or Irish-American person.

"The Gift of the Jews", by Thomas Cahill. Subtitled, "How A Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed The Way Everyone Thinks and Feels". Audio book read by Richard M. Davidson, Recorded Books, Inc, 1998.The central thesis of Cahill's book is that monotheism was introduced through the Jews. From this first incidence of monotheism, in recorded history, flows a personal relationship with God, and from this personal relationship comes a personal responsibility for oneself, one's relations with neighbors and one's outlook on history itself. Cahill records the personal development, (dare it be termed "evolution"?) of this concept from Abraham and Sarah through Isaac, to Samuel, to David and so on. With each important biblical character, the author examines some aspect of the roots of what we consider Western individuality: personal responsibility, personal conscience, personal culpability of humans in this worldwide picture. All of this can be traced to the monotheism of the Jews.Almost forty years ago, even though I was studying engineering, we were required to take courses in theology. The importance of the Jews to monotheism was covered in freshman year. Having accepted this concept back in my college days (many years ago!), I was surprised that Thomas Cahill thought it necessary to write a book on the subject. He has excellent writing ability, but I think that he knows that he was "preaching to the choir", i.e. writing this book for Jews and Christians already convinced of the importance of the Jews in history. Is he writing for the Muslim world? His use of King James version of the English bible is an indication of his target audience. In the United States, Catholics, at a count of about 65 million, represent the largest single church body. Some might say that this count is optimistic, in that half these Catholics do not routinely go to church. If this is so, then the largest church body is the 32.5 million Catholics, such as myself, who go to church on each Sunday, and on the six Holy Days for the United States. Then, the second largest single church body in the United States would be the 32.5 million unchurched Catholics, who were baptized Catholic, (and therefore are baptized Christians), but who do not attend church, or go only at Easter or Christmas. Neither of these groups would use the King James, so why should Cahill quote from that English version of the Bible? There are better translations.Since the author took so long to establish what I think much of his intended audience already accepted, I could not rate this work highly. I did appreciate the excellent reading abilities of Richard Davidson, whose voice helped me through the traffic jams on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston.

"Nobody Comes Back", by Donn Pearce. Subtitled, "A Novel Of The Battle Of The Bulge", A Forge Book, New York, New York, 2005.Although billed as a work of fiction, this book reads like a personal memoir, with autobiographical details centered around anecdotal accounts of the action in December 1994, commonly called "The Battle Of The Bulge". The author, Donn Pearson, has done a great deal of research on the minute details, such as the weapons employed by the Americans and the Germans in this time zone. For example, the firing of the bazooka is described explicitly, as if the author had been there in the snow.The attack of the German army through the Ardennes is the backdrop for the coming of age of the central character, Toby Parker. Toby is only sixteen and has "snuck" into United States Army, just in time to be shipped to the last great battle on the Western Front. He arrives just before main German attack, which was, historically, December 16 1944. So, on December 15th, (as I figure), as a replacement GI, Toby goes into the line for his first time and for his first real combat. Then, it never stops and the author has done a great job in describing the struggle to stem the German breakthrough. During the battle, Toby Parker is wounded, captured, almost executed, and then escapes, to begin the entire process all over again.This book, although fictional, depicts closely the actual events in The Battle Of The Bulge, without naming explicit units, this unit or that unit, etc. The author does mention some units by name, such as the "Golden Lions", which was a division that disappeared in the this battle. He does not present American officers in a positive light, which reflects the historical assessment. In one anecdote, where Private Parker takes a high ranking German officer back to be interrogated, the author (probably intentionally) provides an example of correct behavior as a contrast to the American officers. This is a poignant anecdote, as Toby Parker shares a Christmas peppermint candy with the German POW officer, showing a greater affinity to the German officer than to the Americans who were celebrating Christmas in the midst of the battle struggle.I found the "flash backs" to Toby's civilian and younger life to be distracting from the story development as the battle progressed. Even as a work of fiction, however, this book was very close to an explicit personal memoir. Good writing!

"The Dead Of Winter" by Bill Warnock, Subtitled: "How Battlefield Investigators, WWII Veterans, And Forensic Scientists Solved The Mystery Of The Bulge's Lost Soldiers". Chamberlain Bros. Penguin books, New York, 2005.The subtitle sums up the entire book. Bill Warnock, however, has written a book that combines History with story-telling, with the science of forensics, with the lives of Americans and Belgians, and with the honor of being World War II veterans who had fought and bled in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944. The book is excellent.While serving with the United States Air Force, the author opts for an assignment in a small corner of Europe, near some of the more important battlefields of the Second World War. His life has not been the same since. His initial curiosity becomes what appears to be a life-long obsession, as Warnock and his Belgian friends search for the remains of those soldiers long since dead on the battlefield. But, it is not enough just to find the remains, Mr. Warnock follows through with modern techniques of identification of the deceased, and documents the entire process in an interesting and understandable fashion. While working on each individual solider, Warnock develops a story-book tale of how that individual lived prior to the war, how he entered the U.S. Army, and the probable cause of his death. It is surprising to me how many of the subjects of this book were members of ASTP, Army specialized Training Program. Further, I was surprised to see that my alma mater, Manhattan College (see page 238) had ASTP training. (Manhattan College is in the Bronx.)Warnock's book is enjoyable and well documented. For example, Appendix B, entitled, "U.S. Army Dog Tags In world War II", had me pulling out my Navy dog tag (now fifty years old) for comparison. The dog tag had "...corners rounded and edges smooth" (page 286), with blood type and religion and service number, as in the appendix, but, in the left corner, mine had the term, "USN".One little issue: page 118 had "... Camp Myles Standish near Taunton, Massachusetts." Myles Standish is about 30 miles, or so, from Taunton. The camp, now Myles Standish State Forest, IS located in the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, best known, I would think, for being the place where the Pilgrims came ashore in 1620.

"Debris of Battle" by Gerard A. Patterson. Subtitled: "The Wounded Of Gettysburg" Stackpole Books, 1997.If you think that being unprepared for disaster is a phenomenon of the 21st Century, you should read this book. Before July 1863, the town of Gettysburg had few claims to fame: a shoe factory and a Lutheran seminary. The shoes attracted the Confederate forces then raiding in Pennsylvania. The Southern forces came down from the North into Gettysburg; their presence attracted the Union Army. The Northern forces came up from the South, basically from Washington DC/Maryland. Those three days in July 1863 were one of the most bloody battles ever experienced by American armies. The Battle of Gettysburg is well documented in many, many books, but this book, "Debris Of Battle", addresses the details of how the wounded and the dead, from both sides, were handled.As in New Orleans, the citizens of 1863 Gettysburg were really unprepared for the disaster that was to descend upon them. They hunkered down to weather the storm. When the battle was over, they emerged from hiding places to terrible destruction. As with Hurricane Katrina, the federal, state and local authorities were unprepared to face the destruction all about them. The author's estimate was some 21,000 Union and Confederate wounded. Calls for help went out, and, as with the hurricanes of 2005, contemporary responses were considered slow. The author, Gerard Patterson, documents that some citizens took advantage of the wounded soldiers by charging them ,"... fifty cents to a dollar for their bread". (P.54). The author also documents the tensions and in-fighting amongst the groups that were supposed to be helping the wounded and burying the dead. Again, here was looting, (page 73): they "...were bearing away any and everything that they considered of pecuniary value".Patterson deals directly and sometimes harshly with the 1863 personalities involved. For example, he notes that the superintendent of nurses, Dorothea Dix, (whose likeness appeared on a 1 cent US postage stamp, 1983), was described (by one of her contemporaries), as "A self-sealing can of horror tied up with red tape". Also on page 105, the author notes: " A Unitarian, Miss Dix exhibited another prejudice in her selection process: Only nurses who were Protestants were acceptable. At Gettysburg, this bias was to cause no little friction, because the Sister of Charity had established early on such an impressive and almost saintly presence. " Of course, the Sisters of Charity were a Catholic order of nuns.Gerald Patterson has written a different kind of book about the battle of Gettysburg, It is interesting to see that responses to disasters in the present century have much in common with his historical record of Gettysburg.

"Endkampf", by Stephen G. Fritz. Sub-titled, "Soldiers, civilians And The Death Of the Third Reich", University press of Kentucky, 2004.This is a well-documented record of the last months of the war in Europe, 1945, with an emphasis on the American drive through the south of Germany, into Austria. I say well-documented because, for example, Professor Fritz has devoted pages 276 through 332 on end notes on the subject matter. The author may have overdone it for some readers, because he has almost as many pages of notes as he does have text. This would, however, make my MA thesis advisor happy. Along the same scholarly theme, the book contains some 22 pages of primary sources (pp. 331-352) and some 23 pages of secondary sources (pp. 353-369).Despite these scholarly overtones, Stephen G. Fritz has a written an excellent history of the final chapters of the war, the "end struggle".Contemporary generals (e.g. Eisenhower and Bradley) were quite concerned with the so-called "Werwulf" -Werewolf- groups who were supposed to act as guerrilla units and continue hostilities even though the Wehrmacht had surrendered. Looking back over the past 60 years, we know that this guerilla army was an empty threat. The author, however, spends a lot of time on the this threat, that never materialized. He gives both the high command's ideas of what was happening in the south of Germany, but also presents the "grunt's" view of the end struggle. For example, he clearly shows that the American Army would not tolerate any last ditch defense. If the Hitler Youth or the SS chose to defend a town or village to the last civilian, the Americans would sit back, call in artillery and the USAAF and literally destroy the location. Mr. Fritz documents incidents where the German civilian population wanted to surrender, but the die-hard units (e.g. SS units) wanted to fight to the bitter end. This resulted in some cases of civilians being hanged for treason and in other cases, the SS units evacuating the town. Interestingly, the author has tracked down the men who did hanging and reported on the final judgement on these individuals, many years after the end of the war.I found this book to be well written and to contain a wealth of references and sources on the final victory in the southern part of the Germany and some parts of Austria, as the Allies worked to prevent any post-war continuation of hostilities.

"Refuge From The Reich" by Stephen Tanner. Subtitled: "American Airmen And Switzerland during World War II. Sarpedon, Rockville Center, NY, 2000.More than a decade ago I was working on my MA Thesis (History) and I thought I had written a stellar chapter on the events of the year 1968. You'll recall: LBJ's refusal to run, the assassinations and the violent Democratic National Convention in Chicago. My thesis advisor said "Nice Writing! But, what's the point?" He was correct; that elegant chapter did NOT advance my main point one iota. In fact, the chapter was good background but, beyond that, the chapter did not deal with my subject matter.And that is exactly what the author, Stephen Tanner, did in this book, "Refuge From The Reich". The author's first chapter, "Crashlanding" really grabs you. That chapter deals with the B24 Liberator named "Ginny Gal", and how the crew used Switzerland as a refuge from the Nazi ME109s which were chasing the aircraft.But then, Mr. Tanner jumps to Chapter 2, entitled, "The Herdsmen", where the story cannot be told "...without looking at the history of that small European nation..." Page 21. All of a sudden, we are back in the year 58 B.C. and my thesis advisor's voice is in my head, saying "What's the point?" If the author wanted to present a case for the neutrality of Switzerland, I would have preferred an analysis of the four neutral states in Europe, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland. Ireland was "neutral" but leaned to assisting the Allies. Switzerland was "neutral, but leaned towards assisting the Fascists. The reader struggles to page 38 and we are finally finished with the abridged history of the cantons of Switzerland.But then, the author does not get back to his central theme. Rather, he writes a stellar chapter on the theory of airpower, beginning with how the Boeing people named the B17, "The Flying Fortress". If, howsoever, you would like an alternate view of "Airpower", I would suggest the German view in the book, "The Fire: The Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945" by J&ouml;rg Friedrich (Author), Allison Brown (TranslatorSo, do we get back to the central subject? Not really. Not yet. The next chapter is entitled" Blitzkrieg", and happily, some of the efforts of the Swiss air force to keep the Luftwaffe from flying into Switzerland or over Swiss borders, are recorded. Then, we get a chapter on the political crisis in Switzerland, and then a chapter on daylight bombing, and then "Armed Neutrality", and then, on page 105, we have Pearl Harbor and the sneak attack of the Japanese on December 7, 1941. The book is some 263 pages long, so some 40% of the book is devoted to this "background" material.The remainder of the book DOES deal with American airmen interned in Switzerland, with a very good chapter on the infamous camp at Wauwilermoos. I did enjoy his writing and the story he told. I would give five stars for the good writing but only one star for the organization of the book. Average = three stars.

"Being Present" by Willy Schumann. Subtitled: "Growing Up In Hitler's Germany" Kent State University, Kent, Ohio. 1991.In 1927, Willy Schumann was born in northern Germany, up by the Kiel Canal and the border with Denmark. Due to this location, Willy Schumann, the author of this autobiographic book, had a great interest in the German Navy, (the Kriegsmarine), German warships and seamanship. His father was one of the pilots whose job was to guide large vessels through the Kiel Canal and its locks.The book is an account of how the Nazi Party took over all facets of life in theThird Reich, but most interestingly, it is an account of how the Nazi Party ran almost every aspect of the education system: teachers, curriculum and even the students' expected responses. At an early age, each German boy was required to join the Hitler Youth Hitler Youth compulsory participation (see page 104) took up more and more of a boy's time, as he grew older and older, until, for teenagers, the organization consumed even summer vacations with war games.Willy Schumann recounts his experiences in the Hitler Youth, his indoctrination by Nazi concepts, and his belief in the Third Reich, reinforced, in 1939 through 1940, as the German army won victory after victory. He tells of the joy as the conquests of Poland, Norway, Denmark, and so on, are reported to the German people. In the early years, the only setback that he recalls is the sorrow with the sinking of the Bismark, their "darling ship", by the Royal Navy.The Nazi Party held close control over the German people. Schumann records that the teachers found it wise not to disagree with Nazi propaganda. Religion was ignored in favor of Nazi events, so "...we grew up `like small heathens'". (Page 81.) No one dared to speak out against Adolf Hitler and his actions, and this really became dangerous after the July 20 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. I could go on, but you ought to read his book yourself to get one man's story of a society that, at first, was grateful for better economic conditions but then became more and more fearful as the Nazis took more and more control.To sum up, this is one man's study of how the State consumed every aspect of life until the State, itself, was consumed by outside forces. Schumann tells of his trip through the ruins of the city of Hamburg, which had been consumed by a firestorm, (July 1943), caused by RAF bombing.

"Teddy Bears Trim The Tree", created and written by Sam Williams and illustrated by Jacqueline McQuade. Scholastic, 2000.Sam Williams has written about the Teddy Bear's hunt for the perfect Christmas Tree. They are helped on their way by cooperative Snowmen as a pair of raccoons, in woolen winter caps, run by. The reader is encouraged to help the sleigh (with the perfect tree), slide down the hill. Then, the book's centerpiece pops up to a beautifully trimmed tree and the next page shows Santa alighting on the Bears' roof. The book is nicely illustrated with blues and violets on the outdoor scenes while warm yellows, reds and oranges dominate the indoor pictures. The illustrator and the author have produced a book to remember.Five stars would have been assigned if the moving "pull-the-tab" items were more sturdy.I have three grandsons, and, in my humble opinion, the young boys are rougher on books than are young girls. So, on the page where the Snowmen help the Teddy Bears, the young boys tend to pull the sleigh up and down too quickly, with the result that the paper rips. Further, there is a note, in small print, that warns you, " Before turning the page, push the sleigh back up to its starting position". Adults might push the sleigh up, but children tend to want to turn the page to continue with the story. You have to be careful on some pages of this book so that you do not crumple the moving items. The book is, however, an ideal way to keep young children busy while Christmas preparations occupy the adults of the family.

"The Quest For Freedom" by Yvonne de Ridder Files. Subtitled: "Belgian Resistance In World War II". (which is the subtitle on my copy of the book).Fithian Press, Santa Barbara, 1991.Since retirement as an engineer, I have tried to use my MA in History, leading me to the history of World War II. In my limited experience, there appears to be plenty of books on French Resistance in world War II, with the quantity of books on Polish Resistance being in second place (perhaps). It appears that the number of works on the Resistance in Belgium, Denmark and The Netherlands are few and far between. Therefore, I was happy to see the subtitle, "Belgian Resistance In World War II" on this book. I was disappointed. This book does not address the overall Belgian Resistance, but, rather, is the autobiography of one woman who fought hard and long inside the Belgian Resistance.Having expressed my disappointment, I would not want to belittle nor denigrate the sufferings and sacrifices of Yvonne de Ridder Files. I know that I could never suffer the way that she did and I thank God that as a little boy in world War II, I never had to make real sacrifices.This book is actually an autobiography of Yvonne de Ridder Files, written in the first person, tracing her life from the early stages of World War II through her last divorce and her latest marriage to Lt. Colonel Roger Files, (USAF), in 1970. The book is replete with photos of the author at various stages of the War, along with photos of some of the Allied fliers (e.g. Max MacGregor and Louis Rabinowitz, page 77) that she and the Resistance helped. Time wise, the author's story begins with May 1940, when the "Sitzkrieg" again became a "Blitzkrieg", and Belgium and The Netherlands rapidly capitulated. Yvonne records how she and her husband fled from Belgium into France, and, one night parked near two big, seemingly brand-new barns. She was afraid that the barns would be mistaken for aircraft hangars, although she spelt the "hangar" as "hanger"(page 12). . Her 1940 husband was a Jew with American citizenship and he flees to America and quietly disappears from the remainder of the book. Most of the book, from page 25 up to page 145, deals with her Resistance efforts, including the hiding of explosives, the protection of Allied airmen and, finally, betrayal, capture and torture by the Nazis. Yvonne never gave away any secrets. From page 145 to the end of the book (p. 171) the author recounts her post war activities, serving the Allied forces as an interpreter.I found the writing to be sometimes vindictive here and there, as she describes the actions of her step mother and some of her Belgian neighbors. For a misleading title, one star;for excellent writing and personal reminisces, five stars; for interesting digs at Nazi propaganda, four stars and, finally, for leaving out too much (where's the first husband?) and putting in too many other details, one star. Average 3.5 stars.

"Dissolution" by C.J. Sansom. Viking New York, 2003Dr. C. J. Sansom (he has a Ph.D.) has written a classic murder mystery. He begins immediately with the killing of a Royal Commissioner, a murder that is a no-no. So, Lord Thomas Cromwell sends the hunchback, Dr. Matthew Shardlake, down to Scarnsea and the monastery of St. Donatus to investigate and catch the culprit.The author gives a nice description of a winter's journey in the England of Henry VIII, set in the period just after Anne Boleyn had been beheaded. At the monastery, Dr. Shardlake's investigation identifies not just one, not two, but at least half-a -dozen potential culprits, plus monks screwing around with girls and with boys. The accounting books for the monastery appear crooked, and the Bursar, Brother Edwig, is very, very nervous. In addition, there are the smugglers who avoid the King's taxes by travelling through the swampy moors... despite the danger of being sucked down into the muck. The smugglers' lights can be seen out on the dark moor.Then, a young novice monk is poisoned, and then, a dead body pops up ... pops up literally. All of this goes on while Dr. Shardlake, and his assistant, Matthew, are lodged within the walls of the monastery, where they discover secrets passages! On page 189, the author has Shardlake lamenting, "There are so many threads of inquiry, and they merely multiply. ... There's nothing to lay hold of". The book is 389 pages long, so about half way through, the author underlines the complexity of the murder mystery he is presenting. Then, you think that you have sorted it all out, when the chief suspect gets killed while saving Shardlake's life. Great Murder Mystery.As the story progresses, the book is filled with descriptions of Henry's England during the period when the Reformation was just beginning. The old order was being thrown out; Latin was out and English in.Henry VIII formed a "thought police" which listened to everything said by people from the low ranks to the aristocrats. Fifty years ago, I was freshman at the only Catholic engineering college in New York City. The History professor stated that Henry VIII's thought police was not surpassed until the 20th century with Hitler's Gestapo or Stalin's NKVD. Throughout the book, the author, Dr. Sansom, has dramatized this so well that you actually feel someone looking over your shoulder as you read the old formulas of prayer and services. The Reformation in England was NOT a liberating event.By the way, on page 244, the author says "Women tempt men, as Adam tempted Eve."Doesn't he mean, "... as Eve tempted Adam"??

"The Carrier" by Holden Scott, St. Martin's Press, 2000.A Fast Moving Book mixing modern gene therapy with the modern concern for the upcoming plague.The author, Scott Holden, combines a fairly deep knowledge of modern genetic laboratories with a story of politics in the university setting. His main character is a genius Ph. D. candidate (Jack Collier) from New Jersey who ignores the jealousies on the university campus (Harvard of all places) until his advisor, Professor Dutton springs a rather large conspiracy on Jack. Jack Collier is expelled for plagiarism, while it is Dutton who had done the real plagiarism. In hopes of a Nobel Prize, Dutton steals Jack's work, which was intended as a cure for cancer. In stealing Jack's discovery, Prof. Dutton inadvertently changes the cure into a killer. Jack carries the killer/cure across the United States, while being pursued by FBI agents, one of whom is a psycho and another a Ph.D. in Biology. This is an interesting sub-plot all on its own.The book is well written, but some discrepancies crept in: I do not think that the Boston Police Department has legal authority in Cambridge, where Harvard is located. The references to the BPD should have been to Cambridge Police. On p. 209, the editor permitted "stewardess" to be used, when today's correct usage is "flight attendant". On p. 191, the verb "affects" was used when the noun, "effects" was required. All of this is minor compared to the fast-moving story combining many modern themes.

"The Terra-Cotta Dog" by Andrea Camilleri, "An Inspector Montalbano Mystery". Translated by Stephen Sartarelli. Viking Penguin, 2002.In this novel about Sicily, the author, Andrea Camilleri, has his Inspector Montalbano deal with the usual Mafia crimes, attempted assassinations and actual murders, but the two bodies found in the Mafia cave are the real mystery of this novel. Inspector Montalbano normally investigates more current crimes, but the bodies discovered in a cave, (a Mafia arms cache), had been placed there more than fifty years ago. Montalbano uses his convalescence time (after an attempted assassination) to track down the individual who placed the naked dead bodies of the lovers in the cave just as the Allies were invading Sicily (1943). As usual, the story takes quite a few twists and turns, until the crime is finally solved in the last chapter. Montalbano has to look up an obscure doctoral dissertation on a obscure myth concerning two sleepers to finally resolve the mystery. The terra-cotta dog weaves its way, in and out of the story line, and, finally, in the last chapter, the Inspector places a ceramic dog at the foot of the bed of the old man who explains the entire mystery.Stephen Sartarelli has done an excellent job in translating the original Italian, so much so that it seems to me that the dialogue is good New York English. Again, in the back of the book, there is an interesting glossary of sorts where murky Italian phrases are explained.

"The Snack Thief" by Andrea Camilleri, "An Inspector Montalbano Mystery". Translated by Stephen Sartarelli. Viking Penguin, 2003.Again set in Sicily, this novel, by Andrea Camilleri, has his Inspector Montalbano deal with murder on the high seas and murder in an elevator in a local apartment building. Although there was no apparent connection, Montalbano works the murder of the Sicilian businessman and the murder of the Tunisian "fisherman" until he makes the link. In the intervening pages, he deals with some CIA-type Italians who deal in "useful massacres" (p. 253) and the good Inspector loses his temper. After knocking down Lohengrin Pera (yes, that is the name the author chose), Montalbano crushes this colonel's little eye glasses with his heel, "...as he'd seen in a movie about the Nazis". (p. 259). The Inspector is more human than most of us. As usual with Camilleri's mysteries, you do not get to understand the title until about half way through the book. Also, as customary with things Italian, food and the description of food preparation, play an important part in the story. The child, Francois, orphaned by the murders, will play an important role in a future book, "The Voice Of The Violin".Again, Stephen Sartarelli has done an excellent job in translating, and, in the back of the book, there is an interesting glossary of sorts where murky Italian phrases are explained.

"The Fall of Paris, June 1940", by Herbert R. Lottman, sub-titled, "A Dramatic Narrative of the Final Weeks in Paris Before Its Capture by the German Army". HarperCollins, 1992.This is a lengthy, (410 pages), well written book, describing the last five weeks or so of Paris as a free city before occupation by the German Army. The author, Herbert Lottman, a Native New Yorker, has written on other French subjects, including Marshall Petain, Albert Camus and Flaubert so Lottman is well prepared for this book. Each day from May 9, 1940 to June 23, 1940 is covered in a single chapter. The author did exhaustive research for each chapter. The book is exceedingly complete. After some reading, the reader can be so overwhelmed by the wealth of information that Lottman provides, that the temptation is to sneak ahead to the June 14th Chapter. June 14, 1940, is the day that German troops actually entered Paris.Lottman brings to life the main actors in the French government, including Premier Paul Reynaud, his ever-interfering mistress, the old general Philippe Petain, and newly promoted general, Charles De Gaulle. By referencing their writings, the author also tells the tales of famous people, such as Jena-Paul Sarte, the philosopher, Maurice Chevalier, the actor, and many different journalists, including William Shirer and Clare Booth Luce. He does not, however, limit the personal reminiscences to the rich and famous, but includes recollections of the common people, including the French sergeant ordered to blow up the Eiffel Tower. Interestingly, one of the more memorable individuals in the book is the American Ambassador to France, William C. Bullitt, a friend of President Franklin Roosevelt. I wonder if H. Lottman chose some of the statements and actions of Ambassador Bullitt to provide a form of comic relief for the serious subject in this serious book.Even in such a scholarly work, errors creep in. On page 341, he writes, "There were policemen here and their along their way." Clearly, too many possesive "theirs" are present. He wanted, "There were policemen here and there along their way". On page 394, in describing the visit of Adolf Hitler to a conquered Paris, Lottman terms Hitler, "Reichsfuehrer". Hitler was just simply "Der Fuehrer" and it was Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) who had the title of "Reichsfuehrer". Overall, though, the book is well written and complete to the point of exhaustion.

"The Stars Can Wait" by Jay Basu, Henry Holt and Company, New York 2002.Jay Basu has written an impressive first novel dealing with a young boy, Gracian Solka, coming of age in German occupied Silesia, 1939-1940. Germans in Silesia is nothing new. The Germans have been in Silesia since at least 1210, when they were invited to colonize the swampy land (slightly longer than the English colonists in Massachusetts). The young boy speaks German and Polish, as he was taught by his mother. The older brother, Pawel, however, was of an age between the two World Wars, that he refused to learn German.Gracian, at 15 years old, likes to sneak out in the middle of the night to gaze upon the stars. He has a special place, a clearing in the forest, but, of course, he risks being shot for violating curfew. His older brother, Pawel Solka, had given Gracian a book on astronomy, which Gracian employs to learn the names of all the constellations. To protect Gracian, Pawel has to nail the window shut, so that Gracian can no longer sneak out. As Gracian works in the coal mines (Silesia is famous for its coal), he learns the story of how Pawel was disgraced by having to serve a sentence in a German prison for smuggling, across the German/Poland border. Gracian begins to understand some of the roots of family conflicts and animosity. (Interestingly, since colonial days in Massachusetts, smuggling has never been disgraceful. Even in recent times, during Prohibition, an Irish-American became rich smuggling in whiskey; his son became President of the United States.)Using his German speaking skills, Gracian helps Pawel to land a job in another, more distant coal mine. The owners, bosses and foremen are all Germans, Pawel now has job, too, and this pacifies their mother. Things appear to be settling down. Gracian expands his star-watching to people watching, using the telescope that was another gift from his brother, Pawel. Towards the end, Gracian believes that his star watching/people watching might have been responsible for the death of Pawel's girl-friend, Anna. Finally, at the end, Gracian puts away his book and telescope, as with St. Paul: "...when I became a man, I put away childish things". (I Corinthians, 13:7). Jay Basu shows excellent insight into growing up.

"Binding Up The Wounds" by Leon C. Standifer. Subtitled: "An American Soldier In Occupied Germany, 1945-1946" Louisiana State University Press, 1997.The theme of this book is set by the quotation of the part of Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, which we all know and which is triggered in our memories by "With malice toward none..." In this, his second book on the War, retired professor Leon C. Standifer recounts his experiences in dealing with the conquered German people, learning a little of the German language and learning, it seems, a lot about life and the opposite sex. Professor Standifer has written a very charitable book, using the Second Inaugural Address (March 4, 1865) for a framework for a theme of forgiveness and understanding with the defeated Germans. So many Americans, who tend to quote this section of Lincoln's Address, neglect that in that Address, Lincoln also said that it would be just if the tragedy of the Civil War continue "... until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword". This clearly applied to the Germans who had drawn so much blood.In his first book (see "Not In Vain: A Rifleman Remembers World War II"), the good professor gives the story of his days in combat and how he earned the Combat Infantryman's Badge, that pale blue emblem of having served on the front line. In this present book, Standifer tells the story of his unit's adventures as they begin to understand the Germans as fellow human beings, and not as targets on the field. Since he started out as a very young man from the "back woods" of Mississippi, he grew up in combat and then he was first exposed to urban life in the old cities of the Sudetenland and Bavaria. Throughout the year in occupied Europe, (he says that he had a "ball"), his experiences were firmly filtered through his fundamental Christianity and his background in segregated Mississippi. I can understand some of his background. A dozen years after the time of his book, (1958), I was stationed at Naval Air Technical Training Center, Memphis, and, as a Native New Yorker, I found the segregation in Tennessee to be irritating and different enough to be exotic. Further, in all of Memphis, they did not know what a pizza was, let alone know how to make pizza. (I suspect that national chain restaurants have changed all that today.) So, Standifer's outsider's account of beer drinking, Catholic Bavarians rings true. I suspect that some of the nostalgia that seems apparent on the author's part is due to the fact that 1945-1946 was a happy year when he was young. This is an excellent personal memoir.

"The Second Attack On Pearl Harbor". Subtitled: "Operation K And Other Japanese Attempts To Bomb American In World War II" by Steve Horn. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 2005.Other Amazon reviewers are of the opinion that Steve Horn has "bitten off too much" in his presentation of the Japanese seaplane attack on Pearl Harbor in March 1942. In my opinion, Steve Horn has taken the mosaic of the Second World War and has chosen to polish or burnish a few tiny chips of stone in that mosaic: the Japanese attacks against Hawaii and the American mainland. This book is an excellent job of focusing attention on a little noted arena in the Pacific theatre. For example, the Naval Institute Press published book, "Attack From The Sea; The History Of U.S. Navy's Seaplane Striking Force" by William F. Trimble, (2005), relegates the Japanese attack, Operation K, to two small paragraphs.Steve Horn`s book fills this gap by giving an in-depth presentation of not only Operation K, but many of the other attacks, planned and actual, by the Japanese on mainland America in the Second World War. He gives a detailed assessment of Operation K, while setting it within the historical background, i.e. the time period just before the Battle of the Coral Sea and then, the Battle of Midway. I believe this to be necessary, as to polish one or two stones in a mosaic you have to overlap and polish the surrounding stones. Steve Horn, however, gives just enough information to cover the setting and then refers the reader to other works. The author provides an excellent (and lengthy) bibliography, from pages 315 to 333. But, what I really appreciated was the Appendix entitled, "Glossary Of Aircraft", where Mr., Horn gives the common name for the aircraft, its numerical or alphabetical designator, and then a nice note to explain the aircraft's missionMr. Horn may have been a bit extravagant when he calls the Japanese balloon attack "one of America's first terrorist attacks". An Amazon reviewer picked up on that but then engaged in his own hyperbole when he claimed the use of Indians by France and England during the 18th Century or the abolitionist and pro-slavery terrorists of Kansas and Missouri prior to the Civil War, were early terrorism. The Indians were irregulars in the frontier wars, and, although their attacks were terrifying, they were not terrorism as we understand it today. If not, then the Allied bombing of Nazi Germany was truly "terror bombing". Further, the first true terrorism attacks in these United States were the anti-Catholic attacks by the Know Nothing Party and its predecessors. Otherwise, what do you call the burning of the Ursuline Convent, Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1834? Or the burning of the church of St. Michael in Philadelphia in 1844? Or the burning of the church of St. Augustine in Philadelphia in 1844? Etc.

"Soldiers And Slaves: American POWs Trapped By The Nazis" Final Gamble" By Roger Cohen. Alfred A. Knopf, New York 2005.Roger Cohen has written a book that is an indictment of the Nazi guards and the Nazi work camp system at the small town of Berga, in what was to become East Germany. At the back of the book, he then writes an indictment of the American system of justice which allowed some of the meanest and most nasty German guards to get off with a minimal sentence. The Soviets, on the other hand, quickly and efficiently hanged one of the worst German guards at Berga. See the photo of Willy Hack, facing page 149. (By the way, things are hung, while men are hanged.)What made the concentration camp at Berga different from many of the other Nazi camps was the presence of American Army POWs. Most of these victims had been selected because they were Jewish or because they looked Jewish. Others had been selected because they were troublemakers. The story about these American POWS makes up about half the book.The other half of the book deals with the sufferings of the Hungarian Jews who were also unlucky enough to have been shipped to Berga. As other Amazon reviewers have noted, there is a question as to why the story of the Hungarian Jews was included in this book, nominally on American POWs. Despite the excellent writing, I found myself wanting to skip over the Hungarian story to get back to the American story. The story of the German-American, Hans Kasten, was particularly interesting.

"The War In The Wards" by Stanley Weintraub. Doubleday & Company,NY 1964.Stanley Weintraub is a prolific author. Anazon.Com has more than 16 pages, listing articles and books by Stanley Weintraub. Perhaps his most popular recent book has been "Silent Night", (2001), the story of the impromptu Christmas Eve truce in World War I.When Stanley Weintraub was a young Army officer, he was stationed at a Prisoner of War hospital camp in Korea, while the "Allies" and the Communists were holding truce negotiations at Panmunjom. The hospital was filled with fervent fanatics and with ordinary peasants. The Communists attempted to control them all. There were many "kinds" of prisoners: North Korean who were rabid communists; North Koreans who ordinary peasants drafted into the army; and South Koreans who had been forced to serve in the North Korean Army. POWs with leprosy were segregated for medical reasons. Was this separate leper camp improper according to the Geneva Convention for prisoners? Explanations were required, while the world's press looked on.The task of the captors, the Americans and South Koreans, was to screen the many prisoners so that the "principle of voluntary repatriation" could be applied. Of course, the rabid communists attempted to force the drafted simple peasants and the impressed South Koreans to opt to return to the "people's paradise" of North Korea. The author relates how certain parts of the hospital/camp reacted to these interviews and how the fanatical Communists attempted to force all prisoners to opt for the "people's paradise".Personally, last year, I had surgery and the nurse told me she toke out more than forty staples from my stomach. I felt totally helpless. Well, Weintraub describes how North Korean wounded prisoners were uncompromising in their devotion to communism. Double amputees would march around in the camp, on their bandaged leg stumps, (how did they do it??),fervently shouting anti-American slogans and claiming that the Americans were committing atrocities when they cut off food rations to prevent rioting in the camp/hospital. Rock throwing was constant. Riots and captures of the mess halls and medical stations were common. As an Army officer, Weintraub had to deal with the fervent Communists, the less than zealous peasants, and the impressed South Koreans who only wanted to return South of the 38th parallel. All of this frenetic activity took place while the United Nations watched and while the United States higher command (back in occupied Japan) imposed illogical constraints on the soldiers/guards at the site. What a fiasco!I do not think that the Officer Weintraub had much patience left with the Army Command back in Japan. His frustrations are recorded in this well written book.

"The First Eagle", by Tony Hillerman, Audio Cassette version read by George Guidall, Harper Audio, 1998.Another good Jim Chee/ Lt. Leaphorn mystery, well done and very easy to read. I was steered to this book by checking library listings on the Black Plague and other airborne illness, after I had read "The Doomsday Book" by Connie Willis. The so-called hanta virus had affected, in particular, the Navaho Nation in the American Southwest. The disease, spread by the droppings of small mice and other rodents, provided an opportunity for a cottage industry to grow up in the Southwest where many aspiring Ph.D. students were attempting to make a name for themselves.In the midst of all this, Acting Lt. Jim Chee charges a Hopi Indian, caught while poaching eagles, with the murder of a Navaho Tribal Policeman. The Hopi was arrested red handed, literally!, and Jim Chee believes that he has an open and shut case. But, Chee's once and future fianc&eacute;e, Janet Pete, returns from Washington, DC, as public defender, and, you guessed it, she is assigned to defend the HopiThe plot is twisted and involved enough, when retired Lt. Leaphorn is hired as a "private investigator" to look into the disappearance of Cathy Pollard, a researcher, who vanished on the same day the Navajo policeman was killed. Both Chee and Leaphorn are then immersed in the academic scene as they seek to sought out the involved relationships of prairie dog colonies, fleas, the Black Plague, the disappearance of Ms. Pollard, and the deaths of some Indians from the plague. Hillerman continues to develop the characters of Leaphorn and Chee. For example, there is a poignant scene in the hospital, where Leaphorn's memories of watching his wife, Emma, being wheeled away on a gurney, never to be seen alive again, are described. Leaphorn's life as a widower, also shows up now and then, as in the shower scene in the motel and, later, when he is enjoying eating another person's cooking in the restaurant.I have come to identify George Guidall's voice with Lt. Leaphorn, and, if I ever meet Tony Hillerman in person, I would expect him to sound like Mr. Guidall. Guidall does an excellent job of developing distinct vocal identities for each character, and his portrayal of FBI agents who have been hoodwinked by the "not-so-stupid" Tribal Policeman Lt Chee, is very appropriate. I enjoyed Guidall's reading of "The First Eagle" as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston. Hillerman has another winner.

"Unless Victory Comes", by Gene Garrison (with Patrick Gilbert). Subtitled: "Combat With A Machine Gunner In Patton's Third Army". Casemate, Havertown, PA, 2004.At the very end of his book, Gene Garrison states that "...this book is my memoir. It is not intended to be a definitive history of the fighting in Europe".The author has accomplished his stated purpose, as he has produced a matter-of-fact memoir that describes his experiences in the European Theatre of Operations. As a young man (one of his chapters is entitled, "Turning Nineteen In Battle", page 29), Gene Garrison describes the journey from stateside, (Fort Jackson), to England and then to France, where his outfit, the 87th Infantry Division, arrived after the D-Day invasion.Unlike so many other personal memoirs, this author rapidly sums up basic training and then his transfer to the "Golden Acorn" division, which he describes as a reserve division that had not seen action since World War I. Private Garrison was volunteered to be machine gunner, which he describes as good in that there were two men together, but was also bad since the firepower of the machine gun would draw down enemy attention. His description of standing on the back of a Sherman tank, as he fired the top mount fifty caliber machine gun is all presented with just the facts, even as he is pushed off the tank to avoid enemy fire. Garrison's memoir goes on in this matter-of-fact fashion until the end of hostilities in Europe. Then, at the very end of war in Europe, Garrison is diagnosed with yellow jaundice and required to go to the hospital. Very poignantly, as he leaves his comrades, he shouts a farewell to Tony D'Arpino, saying, "...you're the only one left from Fort Jackson".The chapter is closed with a quote from the front of his book, "When the last man was gone, would there be anyone to miss him?"

"In The Shadows Of War" by Thomas Childers. Sub-titled: "An American Pilot's Odyssey Through Occupied France And The Camps Of Nazi Germany". Henry Holt and Company, New York, 2002.This book is so well written that it reads like a novel, with suspense building up as you turn each page.Will the B-17 pilot, Roy Allen, escape from his badly damaged aircraft? Will he be captured by the Germans? Or be rescued by the French Resistance? The French get to him first and he is assigned to a hiding place in a small village. The young teacher, Colette Florin, hides him as they all await liberation by the Allied Armies coming from the Normandy Beaches. But the Allies are delayed by fierce fighting that Summer of 1944, and Roy Allen decides to leave the relative safety of Colette Florin's rooms above the girls' school. He wants to travel to occupied Paris to reach the Resistance pipeline to get him out of France. It was here that the "novel" aspects began to overwhelm me. I said to myself that I would not write it that way; it would be more realistic if the American flyer stayed with the French teacher in the so-called "Golden Cage" and wait for the Allied Armies. Then I saw the photo section (between pages 240 & 241), and I was reminded that Roy Allen actually existed! He was NOT a fictional character. Nor was Colette. They, along with Pierre Muslant, lived and struggled in wartime France. Pierre Muslant was a member of the French Resistance who was to help Roy escape via Paris. Along with Roy, Muslant was captured and died in Buchenwald, so there is only a sketch of him, not a photograph.The excellent writing along with the actual story of this adventure made it almost impossible to put this book down. Just remember, as you read the book, it is fact, not fiction.

"Handbook of Reliability Engineering and Management", Second Edition, Edited by W. Grant Ireson, Clyde F. Coombs, Jr. and Richard Y. Moss, McGraw Hill, 1996.This is the second edition of the Handbook, which first appeared in 1988. There are individual contributing authors for each of the 27 chapters; the resultant is already out of date. The current "Limbo" status of military documents, such as Military Standard 105 and Military Handbook 217F, makes this present edition of the Handbook out of date in 2000. Will Military Handbook 217F ever be revised to provide up-to-date models for the failure rates of modern electronic components?This Handbook would benefit from better editing. For example, as a Handbook, it is expected that the index in the back of the physical book would contain page references to pertinent reliability terms and techniques. Today's technology emphasizes Environmental Stress Screening, ESS. The term, ESS, has been around for at least 15 years (or so: I recall doing an IEEE paper on ESS in 1988). It is expected that ESS and related terms such as HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing) and HASS, would be readily found in the Handbook's index. They are not.Same thing holds true for Software Reliability, where the chapter's author uses the cute term, "SMERFS Model" (p. 22.15), but this term will not be found in the index. (SMERFS = Statistical Modeling and estimation of reliability functions for software.) By the way, from a technical point of view, this chapter's half page on the various models for software reliability is very skimpy. For example, Dr. Michael Elbert has written an entire IEEE paper on the selection of the proper model for software reliability. It would be expected that a Handbook would be more complete than just a small portion of a page. In Chapter 22, on Software Reliability, the author references a paper on the Rayleigh curve by "Gaffney" (p. 22.13). The reference at the back of Chapter 22 gives the reference's name as "John Gafney". This is a discrepancy that should have been caught by the editors. I suspect that the correct spelling is "Gaffney", but both can not be correct.There are other editorial lapses: on page 16.24, Bellcore failure rates are compared to MIL-HDBK-217, and it is state that Bellcore "... provides generally better failure rates than does MIL-HDBK-217F, which is supposedly based on field experience in communications equipment." The way this sentence is presented implies that MIL-HDBK-217F is based upon experience in communications equipment, when, as most reliability practitioners know, MIL-HDBK-217F failure rates are based on environments from Ground, Fixed, to Ground, Benign, to Naval Sheltered and Airborne, etc, and on equipment from radios to radars to sonars, air data computers and fire control units. This inconsistency in the use of the language ought to have been caught by the editors.On page 16.6, there is a nice comparison of FITs to failures per million hours to %failure per 1000 hours. The Editors should make the reader aware that a billion in American usage (1 with nine zeroes after it) is not the same as European usage. Chapter 6, on FMEAs is totally into the Risk Priority Number method where "gray beards" sit around and use the "Delphi" approach to ascertain the probability of an event, the severity of that failure and whether or not the failure can be detected. This is a very subjective method, and, in my humble opinion, RPN is being superceded by more objective, quantitative methods (see IEC 61508).In summary, prudent purchasers should await the next edition of this Handbook, if that edition considers all the changes taking place in the availability of military standards and the new leadership role of international standards in the reliability arena. For example, IEC 300, on "Dependability" is not even mentioned.John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.

"The Long Walk" by Slavomir Rawicz, Audio Version, Blackstone Audio Books, Ashland, Oregon, 1990. Read by Bernard Mayes. Eight 1- hour cassettes.This is a remarkable story of suffering, endurance, perseverance and loyalty. Slavomir Rawicz was a cavalry officer in the Polish Army when Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia divided Poland. Arrested by the Soviets in 1939, Rawicz was put on "trial" for espionage against the Soviet Union, mainly on the grounds that Rawicz spoke Russian. Why else would a Pole learn Russian ... obviously to spy! Convicted, he is sent to a labor camp in Siberia. Usually, this is enough for good story. The Polish cavalry officer, however, after enduring the hardships of walking, in a raging blizzard, from the railhead to the labor camp, decides to escape.With a little help from the wife of the Camp Commander, Rawicz escapes with six other prisoners, along with a makeshift knife and an ax head without a handle. They walk out of Siberia in the "warm" part of the year, meet a displaced Polish woman (almost a young girl) and include her in their plans.Their plans include walking along the side of the biggest lake in the world, crossing the Gobi dessert without a vessel to carry water, climbing through the Himalayas (without oxygen at heights where it was needed) and finally coming out in British India. The lone American (identified only as Mr. Smith) then uses his command of English to explain their great trek to the British Army. It is almost impossible to believe all the hardships they must endure. They survive the Gobi by eating large black snakes, and the butchering and cooking is described too graphically. They meet various native individuals, and are greeted courteously and sometimes charmingly, despite the lack, sometimes, of a language in common.The young girl dies in the Gobi. The Pole, who sang Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, falls to his death in the mountains. All the escapees lose much weight and they all grow beards and much hair, so that, when they are being medically treated in India, they are surprised to see what each other looks like. After hospitalization, Slavomir Rawicz arranges to be transferred to a Polish outfit fighting in Africa. The entire account is presented in a matter-of-fact fashion; the reader, Bernard Mayes echoes this by using uses a matter-of-fact , almost British accent, when he read the long book. The eight cassettes helped me as I sat in traffic on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston.

&quot;A Colonel in the Armored Divisions&quot; by William S. Triplet, Edited by Robert H. Ferrell, sub-titled, &quot;A Memoir, 1941-1945&quot;. University of Missouri Press, 2001.Robert H. Ferrill, Professor Emeritus, Indiana University, has again taken the writings of William S. Triplet, of Sedalia, Missouri, edited the writings and produced an excellent first person history of an Army colonel's experiences in the Second World War. William Triplet had served as a sergeant in the First World War, began West Point in 1920 and graduated with the class of 1924. This book is really a professional diary of the years from December 1940 up to the cessation of hostiles in Europe, May 1945.The front half of the book is devoted to Triplet's experiences in weapons testing and in developing amphibious craft for the many beach invasions by General MacArthur. At the command for testing the effectiveness of various weapons and devices, Triplet recorded his efforts in examining the effects of the Molotov Cocktail, (ineffective against armor), the prototype for the Jeep and various forms of sleeping bags. With the amphibious craft, Triplet discovers that many (most) Navy personnel do not understand the effects of ocean waves and tells us, quite a few times, that the Navy makes strong coffee. &quot;I sipped the black brew and got it down without wincing. ... tough people these navy types&quot;. P. 64. Again, no love is lost between Col. Triplet and &quot;Admiral Buships&quot;, who questioned the veracity of Triplet's reports on the seaworthiness of the M8 howitzer-turret on the LVT(A-1) hulls. P. 84. The Admiral even &quot;Declined my offer of a cup of coffee, which is the lifeblood of the navy&quot;. P. 84.Perhaps of greater interest to World War II buffs is the last half of the book, recording the Colonel's combat experiences. Triplet appears to be one of the few higher-grade officers to actual go up to the front line during combat. For example, he recounts his surprising an Army sentry who calls back that there is a chicken colonel up here. Unexpected! Triplet mildly disguises his impatience with privates, or generals!, who are reluctant to advance or who appear to be bordering on incompetence. In many cases, he does not record the names of the offending parties. He received one excuse so often that it is used for the title of a chapter: &quot;They've Got a lot of Stuff in There&quot;. At the very end of the book, Triplet recounts, in a matter of fact fashion, the gunfight he had with two German soldiers. After being blown out of his jeep, Triplet draws his .45 Automatic Pistol and shots at two Germans who thought they had finished everybody. Triplet is wounded in the thigh, but escapes and limps back to his command.Professor Ferrell's editing is so unobtrusive that you are only aware, once in awhile, that you are reading the corrected and revised words almost fifty years or so after Triplet had been written down. For example, Prof. Ferrell will italicize the word &quot;illegible&quot; to denote that he could not decipher what Col. Triplet wanted. An excellent job of editing.

"Sahara" by Marq de Villiers and Sheila Hirtle: sub-titled "A Natural History" Copyright 2002 by Jacobus Communications Corp.This book opens with a major error. On page 13, the authors say, "In 1803 George Washington made war against the beys". ("Bey" being a Turkish or Egyptian title.) Of course, this is impossible since George Washington died in 1799. I believe the authors wanted Thomas Jefferson.On page 12, "Many of these countries are, qua countries with national governments and seats in the United Nations"...."qua countries"? Forgive me, but is this some South African usage of English/Latin?On page 14, they speak about the French overrunning Algeria with "...European protectorate" being called "...a nice imperial euphemism", which is okay in today's politically correct jargon. But, then, in the next two pages the authors describe the French, Italians and Spanish all moving into "...provinces of the decaying Ottoman Empire"... without sensing the illogic of not defining the Ottoman's imperial aspirations as being as bad as those of the Europeans. Page 16: "In 1835 the Ottoman Turks sent a fleet to assert a rather more direct control..." in what was later called Libya. What? Italian Europeans in Libya are imperialists and Ottoman Turks do not deserve the same label? Too Much. Too politically correct.On page 15: "...Tunisia was called Ifriqiyah, from the Roman word for Africa..."; now the Romans spoke Roman. Or was it Latin? It would have been interesting for the authors to show how "Africanius" metamorphosed into "Ifriqiyah".Too much. Too many. The authors should submit their manuscript (it is not yet a book) to a competent historian and to a person competent in geography for fact checking and screening. While the manuscript is there, perhaps they can do a global change and replace the many contractions, "it's" and "don't" with "it is" and "do not" respectively. If such contractions are not permitted in an MA thesis why allow them in a formal book?

"Log Of The Liberators" by Steve Birdsall.Subtitled: "An Illustrated History Of The B-24".Doubleday, & Company, Garden City, NY, 1973Steve Birdsall is an Australian author (b. 1944), who really likes writing about World War II bombers. Amazon.Com has a list of five pages showing the many aviation books Mr. Birdsall has written: B17, B24, B26 and B29. Some 18, 482 B24 Liberator bombers were built as opposed to only 12,731 B17 Flying Fortresses. Only 3970 B29 Superfortresses were made. But, of all the World War II bombers, I think that Mr. Birdsall really likes the B24 Liberator.This present book, "Log Of The Liberators", is a concise and heavily illustrated volume. The book traces the development of the bomber and the subsequent deployment of the B24 Liberator in all the theaters of the war, from Alaska to Australia, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The book, as far as I can see, is a fairly complete history of the B24 Liberator and its usage in World War II. Much of the front of the book, from page one to page 113, deals with the action in the European Theatre of Operations. The history of the B24 in the ETO is interesting in its own right.But, then, the last section of the book deals with the B24 in areas rarely addressed. For example, the chapter entitled "War At The End Of The World" describes the action (inaction) in the Aleutians and mainland Alaska. The home islands of Japan were about 900 miles from American air bases in the Aleutians, and, as said on page 118, "...the invasion of Japan from the north would be possible in the spring of 1944." The invasion never took place, but this section of the books does a great job of describing how the weather was the greatest enemy in this theatre of the war.Back in the late 1950s, I flew in Navy patrol bombers (P2V-7 Neptune), so I was very interested in the portion of Birdsall's book which dealt with the US Navy patrol and bombing squadrons. On page 62, there are two good photos of the Navy PB4Y PRIVATEER, which was a B24 with single tail fin...and the tail was very tall! This book has one of the few histories of the Navy squadrons, VPB-11, 116, 177 and so on. VPB 117 was named the "Blue Raiders". The B24 was also used in Navy VB squadrons, which were later re-named VPB, that is bombing squadrons became bombing and patrol squadrons. Personally, I do not know of a more complete history of the Navy squadrons in the popular press.Nicely done book!LOG OF THE LIBERATORS: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE B-24

"The Plague Tales", by Ann Benson. Audio Cassette version read by Juliet Stevenson, Bantam Doubleday Dell Audio Publishing.This is an excellent book, set in two different eras: England in the near term future and Europe during the 1300s and the Black Plague. The author switches back and forth from a future where antibiotics do not work to a past where antibiotics are unknown. There are two different stories being told, centering on the threat of the Black Plague, and which are neatly wrapped up and tied together in the last chapter of the book. In my opinion, the characters in the future world, located physically in London and the north of the UK, are not developed as fully as are the characters in the past world. The 14th Century physician, Doctor Alejandro Canches, is nicely portrayed, but unnecessarily complicated (again, in my opinion), by making him a Jew in a Christian world. It was difficult enough to be a physician dissecting cadavers at a time when the dead body was considered sacred, without adding the distrust of being a Jew (an outsider) in a Christian society. However, Ann Benson builds a likeable character in Dr. Canches, a Spaniard, who travels first to France and then to England. Then, it is not really clear how he is able to communicate so effectively in France and in England.The author's future world, not as fully developed as her past story world, contains some macabre happenings. For example, the main protagonist, a surgeon, Janie Crowe, surgically removes the hand of a dead man so as to be able to open an electronic keypad, programmed to recognize and identify people by their handprint. Besides being difficult to imagine without taking sick, you wonder if this description of mutilation is truly necessary for the advancement of the plot.The audiotape reading of the book by Juliet Stevenson is a stellar performance. Using a woman's voice, J. Stevenson convincingly represents the royal tones of England's King Edward III, and then quickly becomes the sweet voice of Edward's illegitimate daughter, Kate. By itself, this reading performance facilitates the reader in seeing both past and future worlds and enhances the impact of the book. The talent of Stevenson made the book even more interesting as I drove along I-495, the ring road around Boston.

"Roll Me Over" by Raymond Gantter; sub-titled: "An Infantryman's World War II."Ivy Books, New York, 1997.This is a very personal reminiscence of an infantryman's progress across Europe, from Normandy to Prague, during the last year of battle in World War II. Private Gantter was college educated when most of his compatriots were not. He preferred classical music to the more popular "jazz" of his buddies. R. Gantter was married while most of his fellow GIs were not. He was sensitive and, like his companions, afflicted by homesickness ...which also included being with his wife and children. His daily observations of war and its effects were recorded sporadically (on scraps of paper) and later served as the basis for this book. All of this results in a sensitive, personal and compassionate analysis of the advance of the American Army across Europe.Gantter's ability, however limited, to speak German put him in demand, and gave him additional insight into the impact of the war on civilian population, even though they were the enemy. Some incidents in his career as translator reinforced his negative opinion of the officers of the US Army. For example, he was rushed down to act as translator to find that the American officer was dealing with petty concerns: the warmth in the commandeered house, the placement of furniture and so on. Throughout the book, Gantter has very little good to say about the officers of the American Army, thereby echoing other books describing personal disappointments of the officer cast of the same era. There were few "Chesty Pullers".Gantter does present poignant imagery, as in his description of the shooting and killing of a German soldier, whose overcoat flaps were flouncing up and down as he ran way in the snow. As a side issue, his personal recollection of the house holds shrines he found in Germany (even though he called some "Bleeding Heart" when he meant "Sacred Heart") is an independent confirmation of the inability of the Nazi Party to stamp out the faith and devotion of German Catholics. (For comparison, see: "Under The Bombs" by Earl R. Beck, "The German Home Front 1942-1945" University Press of Kentucky, 1986.)

"Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945" by Frederick Taylor, Harper Collins, New York, 2004.Despite the title including the famous (infamous) date of the bombing of Dresden, this book deals with so much more than just that raid. The author begins with a chapter, "Saxons", tracing the common roots of the present day peoples of both Britain and Saxony. Remember, historically, the "Anglo-Saxons" displaced the Celtic peoples who inhabited England. In the next four chapters, Frederick Taylor develops Dresden's history, from a swampy frontier settlement to the "Florence on the Elbe". Then, the author devotes at least three chapters to the impact of National socialism on Dresden, including a chapter irreverently entitled , "The Saxon Mussolini".Then, the heart of the book may be found in the chapters in which Taylor addresses the air war in general, its morality and its effectiveness. I wish that I had this book for course on World War II that I took while working on an MA in History. We spent a quite a few class sessions dealing with the effectiveness of Air Power, and whether or not Sea Power or the Infantry won the war. Taylor's book presents new insights into the methods employed to measure Air Power's effectiveness. (or ineffectiveness, if you care to take the other point of view).There are chapters dealing with the actual horrors of the actual raid. The author brings into print an examination of how the German people felt as they realized they had survived the night raid by the RAF but were then attacked by the day raid of USAAF. Obviously, the author's ability in the German language helped him to present a more human side of the event.In the last few chapters, Taylor shows how the Soviets used the bombing raid as propaganda during the Cold War; the enormous number of causalities, quoted by the Third Reich, were cast in concrete by the Soviets. Even in death, the people were being used by tyrannical masters.In the chapter entitled, "The Sleep Of Reason", on page 411, the author states, "It is rarely mentioned that almost exactly the same number of Soviet citizens died as a result of bombing during the Second World War as Germans: around half a million". Then he recounts the Luftwaffe's "..."thousand-bomber raid" ...on Stalingrad. From an engineering point of view, i.e. form, fit and function, it appears the German air force, the Luftwaffe, was able to perform as well as the combined forces of the RAF and the USAAF. Although the German Dorniers and Heinkels may not have been as excellent a bomber as were the British Lancasters and the American Liberators,the Luftwaffe, by Taylor's own accounting, killed as many people as did the Allies. Form, fit and function means that although the designs were different the end results were the same. Perhaps the author would like to expand on book on the bombing of Dresden to a volume on the bombing campaigns of the Luftwaffe?

"Unsung Valor" by A. Cleveland Harrison. Subtitled: "A GI's Story Of World War II". University Press of Mississippi, Jackson. 2000.This is a very complete and detailed book, tracing the experiences of a skinny Southern boy, (in 1943), drafted into the United States Army, deciding on the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), trained at the University of Mississippi, transferred into a regular Army unit (the 94th Division) and then sent to the European Theater of Operations, ETO, just when things were becoming really hot. General George Marshall had shut down the Army Specialized Training Program so as to supply warm bodies as replacements for all the causalities in the ETO. The author, A. Cleveland Harrison, recounts being wounded (88 artillery fire,) as his Division advanced on the town of Orscholz, his treatment, infection, his stint in hospital and, finally, his recovery. Then, he remained in England until his reassignment, April 1945, to the hostilities in Europe. Happily, the war in Europe ended in May 1945, and the author became a "Clerk-Typist" in Versailles, France and later, a "Mail Clerk-Draftsman" in Frankfurt am Main.If you have had the opportunity to study the history of World War II, you probably have been exposed to the grand strategies of different battles, the movement of this numbered unit on one side against another number on the other side. You might even have become impatient with the stories of how one American general (or two) could not get along with a certain British field marshal, and begin to wonder how many people were killed by the egoistical personalities of such high ranking individuals. So, this present work, by A. Cleveland Harrison, is a refreshing relief in its detailed examination of the feelings and daily experiences of an ordinary Americana solider in the ETOI became the fiftieth reviewer of this book because of the correspondence form Dr. Harrison prodding me to add his book to my Amazon Listmania list on the Army Specialized Training Program, ASTP. The first two chapters of Dr. Harrison's book deal extensively with the Army Specialized Training Program. certainly merit a place on any list on the ASTP. Thos chapters speak about an ASTP experience at a Southern university, which, from what I read, quite different than the ASTP experience at Manhattan College, my alma mater. I do not believe that an ASTPer at Manhattan College had to be concerned with how to wear a saber without getting the weapon caught between his legs. On the other hand, the Manhattan College ASTPer had to be concerned with living in an apartment on 7th Avenue.I am happy to join some 45 other Amazon reviewers in assigning five stars to this book.

"Cracking The Zero Mystery" by Jim Rearden. Sub-titled: "How The U.S. Learned To Beat Japan's Vaunted WWII Fighter Plane" Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1990.In June 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy feinted towards the Aleutian Islands off Alaska, in an attempt to draw U.S. Navy forces away from the impending battle of Midway. One result of this IJN thrust towards Alaska, was that Flight Petty Officer Tadayoshi Koga crashed his Zero into a muddy bog on Akutan Island, some twenty five miles East of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Because the Zero was crashed in Alaska, Jim Rearden became interested in writing its story. The back cover of the book notes that, after the War, Mr. Rearden "...moved to Alaska to teach wildlife management at the University of Alaska". His devotion to things Alaskan is evident in his book chapters dealing with the crashed Zero in Alaska. In fact, in my humble opinion, those chapters are most interesting in this small book, only 128 pages, (including the index).The author, Jim Rearden, has done a lot of research into the pilot of the Zero, Petty Officer Tadayoshi Koga, using Japanese sources who were happy to help. The author also tracked down the Americans who were involved in the discovery of the crashed Zero, July 1942, and its subsequent recovery, and, if these people were still alive, obtained their personal remembrances about the events. Finally, to cap it all off, using "...three Navy photos of the downed plane"...(p. 110), Rearden was able to locate the actual crash site and the then empty grave of Petty Officer Koga. This was a rather poignant chapter of the book. The least interesting chapter (even though I am a retired engineer), was the Appendix which compared Koga's Zero with contemporary U.S. Fighter planes. This appendix read too much like an engineering report.Mr. Rearden saw fit to add chapters dealing with the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, the importance of the Battle of Midway and the impact of the Zero on the war in then Pacific. I felt that they these chapters were somewhat unnecessary for a book of this type. So, five stars for the excellent research, four stars for the good writing, and three stars for the superfluous history. Average is four stars.

"The Conquerors" by Michael Beschloss.As so many of my fellow Amazon reviewers have noted, this book ought to be entitled, "The Morgenthau Plan". The celebrated Historian, Michael Beschloss, has produced a well-written volume documenting the in-fighting of the Roosevelt Administration on this plan for dealing with Germany after the war was won. The events after the cessation of hostilities show that the Morgenthau Plan was really implemented.Mr. Beschloss , as with so many American historians, has neglected, or at least, minimized reporting what happened to the eastern part of Germany. In the west, Allied bombing had destroyed most of the German industry, In the east, the Red Army did the same. Towards the end, Adolph Hitler issued orders to destroy everything in the path of the on-coming Soviets. Some fanatical German units did just that, while others ignored the Fuhrer's orders. Thus, in May 1945, Germany was fundamentally devoid of industry, with the only untouched areas being small farming towns and villages.The Soviets then forced Germans to leave East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania, and, in turn, forced the Poles west to these now unoccupied lands. This has been called the greatest forced migration in history. Beschloss briefly mentions this on page 258, where he reports that Stalin "... insisted that giving German land to Poland should be no problem because no Germans were in the region." The result was a de facto implementation of the Morgenthau Plan: the reduction of Germany into an agricultural nation, struggling to feed its people. It seems that it was not until the 1949 Berlin Blockade and the subsequent Berlin Airlift that Americans, British and French began the re-vitalization of German industry and the re-birth of the German nation. Self-interest? Or Christianity and Kindness"? (p.105). One has to wonder if Stalin had been more subtle or more surreptitiously clever, if the Iron Curtain would have reached west to the Rhine and Germany would have disappeared. Five stars for excellent writing; three stars for addressing a different subject in a somewhat incomplete fashion: four stars average.

"Tank Driver" by J. Ted HartmanSubtitled: With The 11th Armored From The Battle Of The Bulge To VE Day".Indiana University Press, 2003.In 1943, J. Ted Hartman graduated from high school and became a member of the United Stares Army. After training in Camp Roberts, California, he was assigned to the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) and he traded his hometown college town of Ames, Iowa for the college town of Eugene, Oregon, University of Oregon. In February, 1944, the Army Specialized Training Program was shut down and most the ASTPers at University of Oregon were assigned to the 11th Armored Division. Hartman states, "So much for the word of the army" and he places that comment in italics. Every now and then, the author will use the same statement, in italics, to point out the duplicity of the Army, in particular, and the government, in general.Camp Cooke, California. On page 24, the author recounts that a "...lieutenant at the microphone was trying to be funny at 2 A.M. When we weren't responsive, he began making nasty remarks about college kids and ASTP. It was all downhill from there". As you go through life, the sad thing is that the nasty remarks and the hurtful looks are more easily remembered. Here, an unnamed lieutenant has been remembered with a subliminal curse in this book. J. Ted Hartman brings this same attention to personal remembrances throughout the book, as the 11th Armored Division trains in the U.S., crosses the ocean and begins its combat career in Europe.The author traces the path of his division from the Battle of The Bulge, in Belgium, through Luxemburg, across the Siegfried Line and into Germany. They cross the Mosel River and travel south across Germany, with a side trip into Worms. All of these engagements are documented in a personal way, but they are also accompanied by maps and photos. The maps have been simplified to remove unnecessary details and then the maps are annotated to accompany the text. For example, on page 84, the map has a note, "Fulda. Defended bitterly. Armor bypasses to north", which is further explained in the surrounding pages. His personal comments are quiet and unassuming: "...a sniper hit Zaher, one of our most capable tank commanders. While we provided cover, the medics evacuated him". (Page 102).This is a very uplifting personal memoir. The shock of battle, having a tank shot out from under them, the discovery of the horrors of the concentration camps, all generally reflecting the history of the 11th Armored Division, are covered in this excellent book. The book ends with two concluding chapters. "Waiting To Go Home" tells about the occupation forces in Europe, while the chapter, "Belgium Remembers" recounts a visit to various battlefields in 1994, the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.

"Blue Skies And Blood" by Edwin P. Hoyt. Subtitled: "The Battle Of The Coral Sea". Paul S. Eriksson, Inc. New York, 1975.If you query Amazon.Com you will find that Edwin P. Hoyt has written some 80+ books, many dealing with naval battles and some with infantry warfare. He has also written biographies, e.g. President Grover Cleveland and President James A. Garfield.In this book, he deals with the Battle of the Coral Sea, May 1942; he has dedicated the book to Admiral Arleigh Burke, who made his reputation with destroyers in the South Pacific. Coral Sea was the first sea battle in which the opposing vessels never sighted their enemies and in which aircraft did all the damage. Just as the Battle of Lepanto (1571) signaled the change in sea power from galleys (rowed by men) to sailing vessels, the Battle of the Coral Sea marked the switch from the big guns to air power.Using official documents of both the U.S. Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy, Edwin Hoyt has produce a well-written record of what went on in the Coral Sea, just north of Australia . The author also relied upon interviews with war correspondent, Stanley Johnson, who was "embedded", as we now say, on board the USS Lexington. Stanley Johnson wrote the book, "Queen Of The Flat Tops", (1942). It seems to me, that while Hoyt has an excellent ability to recount and interpret the battle's historical facts, the author is also able to bring alive the persons who actually were involved. Their experiences become vivid in his writing.The author has paid particular attention to Navy tanker, "Neosho" and her escort, the destroyer "Sims", which were sunk by IJN aircraft as a prelude to sinking of the "USS Lexington" and the Japanese carrier, "Shoho". I get the impression that Mr. Hoyt considers the Battle of the Coral Sea to be just as important as the naval battle of Midway, June 1942, in which four IJN aircraft carriers were sunk. At various places in the book, Hoyt makes the points that Coral Sea was the first sea battle in the opponents used only carrier aircraft, it was the first sea battle in which the Japanese were set back, if not defeated, and Coral Sea stopped the bombing of and the impending invasion of Australia by Japanese forces.This book is not only an excellent historical record of the events, but it also makes alive the participants, from the lowliest seaman to the admirals.

"Excursion To Tindari", by Andrea Camilleri. Subtitled: "An Inspector Montalbano Mystery". Translated by Stephen Sartarelli. Penguin Books, 2005.When a young man, N. Sanifilippo, is assassinated in front of his apartment building, the murder has all the signs of being a Mafia hit. "They shot him once. Bull's -eye, in the middle of the forehead." (Page 7). But then, an elderly couple, Mr. & Mrs. Griffo, who live in the same apartment building, go missing. Is there a connection? Were the elderly people abducted to hide some aspect of the crime? Inspector Montalbano is on the outside of the murder mystery, and he begins to investigate only the disappearance of the Griffo couple, slowly but surely interrogating the occupants of each apartment on the Via Crucis. "The last station on the Via Crucis was Apartment 19, fourth floor..." (Page 33).Unlike other Inspector Montalbano novels, the title is explained fairly early in this book, as it appears that the Griffo couple had gone on an excursion to Tindari to view the Black Madonna. Tindari is north of Catania, almost at the Straits of Messina. It seems that the Black Madonna statue had been fished out of the sea, and healing powers had been attributed to the statue. But!, the Griffo couple were in fairly good health. The Inspector tracks down the bus line that runs the excursions, meets a good looking woman who was the attendant, and the end result is that the Griffo couple went to Tindari, but they got off the bus just before returning home. Inspector Montalbano goes to sit under his famous Saracen oak to ponder all this, and the description of the snake-like weaving and interweaving of the oak's branches is fabulous. The murder of Sanifilippo and the murders of the Griffo couple are also intertwined like the oak branches. The forensic evidence shows that the Griffo couple were murdered together, while they were holding hands. Inspector Montalbano brings it all to an end in his usual fashion, which is all I'll tell you...

"Not In Vain" by Leon Standifer. Subtitled, "A Rifleman Remembers World War II. Louisiana State University Press, 1992.When Leon Standifer volunteered, he was a tall, lanky Southern boy who had not traveled far his home town of Clinton, Mississippi. The book begins with a letter dated "Sept. Beats me, 15? 1944, Somewhere in France". Professor Standifer had signed up for the Army Specialist Training Program (ASTP), where deserving individuals (read "smart guys"), would be sent through college by the U. S. Army and then be expected to later serve in positions that were technically demanding. The war, however, changed all that and Leon Standifer and all the other ASTP soldiers, were given some basic infantry training and were shipped to France. Standifer, assigned to the 94th Infantry Division, landed in Normandy in August 1944, and then went to Lorient, France to contain German troops in a pocket. Combat was not heavy there, but he saw Americans getting killed.Standifer's training made him into the "point man", the soldier who would lead the advance towards an enemy's position. Standifer's book presents a complete account of combat, from the of the fear in leading patrols to the abrasive routine life of a soldier waiting for something to happen. He was wounded (perhaps by friendly fire) and came back to his company near in January 1945. In that bitter Winter, Leon developed pneumonia and frozen feet; he was rotated out to England and did not return to Europe until the War was almost over. Thus, he experienced much of the European Theater of Operations: landing in Normandy a few months after D-Day, the drudgery of siege-like waiting, being wounded, returning to his unit, and then finding some of his old friends missing, not being accepted the "new" old-hands in the unit and the joy of seeing hostilities ending. This book documents many of the experiences of many of the soldiers in ETO.

"The Bishop And The Beggar Girl Of St. Germain" by Fr. Andrew M. Greeley, Audio book Version narrated by George Guidall. Recorded Books Productions, New York 2001.The author, Fr. Andrew Greeley, moves the venue for this Bishop Blackie mystery to Paris, and it seems that he certainly knows Paris: at least the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the subway system, many subway stops and the little bistros on the Left Bank. Using this as backdrop, Fr. Greeley has Bishop John Blackwood Ryan accompany his Cardinal, Sean Cronin, of Chicago, to Paris, where Bishop Blackie is impressed as a detective in the service of the local cardinal. "Blackie" is requested to find the young television priest, Jean-Claude, who had disappeared during a TV shoot in the 3rd Century basement of Notre Dame.Needing an interpreter, Bishop Blackie "stumbles" on Marie-Bernadette, an accomplished musician who is begging outside the Church of St. Germain. Greeley's fascination with thing Celtic (pronounced as KEL-tik) means that Marie-Bernadette's accomplishments are in Celtic music, whether from the Celtic region of France or the Basque region of Spain, or, of course, from Scotland and Ireland. This makes a nice little sub-plot, with Bishop Blackie officiating at Marie-Bernadette's marriage at the end of the book.Of course, Blackie solves the mystery of the disappearance of the television evangelist priest, Jean-Claude, and while doing so, Author Greeley comments on the loneliness of the celibate clergy, their trials and temptations. I couldn't help wondering if there was some autobiographical issues buried in those comments. The story's main plot had a nice little twist that I should have been able to catch earlier than I did!Narrator George Guidall was again excellent. I have listened to him as the voice of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee in the Tony Hillerman mysteries, and it is amazing how Mr. Guidall can range from "flat" Navajo tone in those books to an excited French accent for the exalted cardinal of Paris in this book. I enjoyed the book and listening to Mr. Guidall as I commuted on I-495, the ring road around Boston... Five Stars.

"Railroading In Eighteen Countries" by Carl R. Gray Jr.Subtitled: "The Story Of American Railroad Men Serving In The Railway Service, 1862-1953".Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1955.This is the record of the railroaders who went to war. The activities and the sacrifices of this group are rarely recounted in overall histories of America's wars, but railroaders made a great contribution to the success of many campaigns. The author, Major General Carl Gray, Jr. was Director General of the Military Railway Service, 1942-1945, so, naturally, in my opinion, there is a greater emphasis on World War II in this book.The book is written in what I would call "college yearbook" style. By "college yearbook", I mean that there was an attempt to cover all departments, places and persons. The directors of major railway lines (e.g. New York Central) were drafted into positions of authority in the Military Railway Service, so these gentlemen rate a formally posed photograph, in which they are shown in dress uniforms with ribbons and bars. Most of these posed photographs show general and colonels. Following the college yearbook style, there is a photo of all the Military Railway Service groups in most of the different theatres of the Second World war, and some interesting shots of railroad action as far back as the American Civil War up to and including Korea. The book covers the railroad action from the Civil War up to and including operations in Korea, 1953.One of the things that I did not like was the use of acronyms (undoubtedly necessary, but still stumbling blocks to easy reading). So, the M.R.S was made up of ROBs and RSBs, which reported to a Rail Grand Division, each of which was sponsored by a major railroad of the United States, e.g. the New York Central, the union Pacific, etc. (See page 25). R. O.B. = Railroad Operating Battalion and R. S. B. = Railroad Shop Battalion. So, on page 67, you read "The 713 R.O.B. on arrival at Casablanca was moved forward..." See what I mean.The book IS a foundation document covering the use of railroads in major and minor theatres of war. Some of the facts in this book are rarely found in broad and general histories. For example, on pages 14-16, you will find a brief report of the United States Navy batteries in the First World War. These sailors operated 14 inch guns from railroad carriages. "The locomotives were built by Baldwin and the cars were built by Standard Steel Company". Some of the book reads like a railroad monthly operating report. "Tonnage moved out of the Port of Naples for the month of January 1944 was 137,108 tons" (P. 163).The Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the insurrection in the Philippines, and the 1916 Pancho Villa expedition are all briefly addressed. On page 5, the American Civil War, the author writes "It is believed that the failure of the Southern government to use railroads to their maximum capacity for logistical support of the armies was the greatest factor in its ultimate defeat." Interesting.

This is for the recording. The action in Patrick Robinson's &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot; moves at quite a pace. Robinson introduces techncial issues rapidly and efficiently to show how a submarine could shoot down airliners (including one with the Vice President of the United States). The motivation of Commnader Benjamin Adnam is understandable, but the author does not make a good case for Adnam's conversion into a distressed penitent ...attempting to make admends for all his crimes against humanity. The characterization of the American Admirals suffers in the recorded version. I listened to David McCallum (of &quot;Man From Uncle&quot; fame) on my daily drive. McCallum failed to convert his educated British accent into a reasonable facsimile of an American twang. Further, the author puts too many &quot;F---this&quot; and &quot;holy sh--&quot; and &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot; into the admiral's dialogue. I found it offensive. American admirals have long since passed the stage of bumbling colonials, unable to make a coherent statement under stressful situations ---- especially admirals who are supposed to be giving daily briefings to the U.S. President. (By the way,&quot;stewardess&quot; is out and &quot;flight attendant&quot; is correct.) Finally, the ending is weak. It is difficult, based upon the characterization of Muslim Commander Adnam, to believe that he would end it all that way.

"Parachute Infantry", by David Kenyon Webster, sub-titled: "An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day And The Fall Of The Third Reich", Louisiana State University Press, Baton rouge, 1994.This book was published some fifty years after the events described and some 30 years after the death of the author (1961). However, the personal memories are excellent as is the writing. The book deals with the author's personal experiences in the European Theater of Operations and it seems that he did not record the time in hospital after he was wounded. Webster's leg wound made him miss the Battle of the Bulge, so he simply alludes to that struggle when he returns to his outfit towards the end of the war. He does deal with parachuting into Normandy on D-Day and, at the end of the war, chasing the remains of the German Army into the mountains.I think that you could almost sense that the Author was recording the more "exciting" days and planning to fill in the more mundane details, such as his weeks in hospital, when he later had time. One thing that did come through, loud and clear, was the enlisted man's disdain for the officer corps in the EOT. Webster's record of occupation duty, directly after the cessation of hostilities, is entertaining. I can just picture him, getting ready for his daily swim in the lake, and wondering where he should "dine" that night. Enjoyable book!

Contending With Modernity by Philip Gleason, of Notre Dame University. Book is subtitled, &quot;Catholic Higher Education in the Twentieth Century.&quot; At the outset, Professor Gleason notes that the historiography of Catholic Higher Education is severely limited. I bought Prof. Gleason's book (from Amazon.com, by the way) since there were so very few books dealing with the history of Catholic colleges and universities in the United States. And I needed references for my MA thesis on Catholic colleges. By writing a history of Catholic higher education, from 1900 to 1995, Dr. Gleason has expanded the field. In covering this time period, the author has chosen to emphasize the struggles of Catholic colleges and universities to deal with modern ideas. These struggles were exacerbated by the suspicion within the Catholic Church raised by &quot;Americanism&quot; a name given to the modern forces which presented grave dangers to the Faith and identified, rightly or wrongly, with the American church. Gleason spends the first part of his book showing how that mis-identification affected American Catholic schools up until about the end of World War II; he then brings in various other historical events and figures, including the work of Dorothy Day, Fr. Curran at The Catholic University of America and, towards the end of the book, the charge of anti-intellectualism lodged by Msgr. John Tracy Ellis. Philip Gleason, however, does not raise the counter-charge by Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the noted fiction writer and sociologist, who has found Catholic schools be just about as intellectual or anti-intellectual as other colleges and universities in the United States. In the last few pages, Prof. Gleason missed a grand opportunity to explore in greater detail the potential impact of &quot;Ex Corde Ecclesiae&quot;, the August 1990 Constitutional Document of Pope John Paul II, on modern Catholic higher education. Some features of this document, such as the requirement for an Oath of Fidelity, have been fought on the grounds of academic freedom and autonomy for the Catholic colleges and universities (particularly by some in the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, ACCU). The author has documented his citations with about 92 pages of notes and references, making this volume a great step forward in filling the gap in the historiography of Catholic Higher Education. There are many nuggets to be mined, as, for example, if your interests is the &quot;Great Books&quot; approach to higher education, Dr. Gleason's book leads you to references for the attempted &quot;Great Books&quot; program at St. Mary's College in Moraga, California. The book is worth the price for wonderful tidbits such as that.

"The Last Flight Of Bomber 31" by Ralph WetterhahnSubtitled: Harrowing Tales Of American And Japanese Pilots Who fought In World War II's Arctic Air Campaign". Carroll & Graf Publishers, New York 2004.The author's emphasis is on the plural in "Tales" in the subtitle. Ralph Wetterhahn has told many different stories in this book. In the first case, the author has woven the tale of Bomber 31 into a succinct history of the Alaska/Aleutian Campaign of World War II. A Navy PV-1 Ventura was Bomber 31, flown by Lieutenant Walt S. Whitman, from Alaskan bases against the northern islands of the Empire of Japan. The crash site was discovered on Russian territory, Kamchatka, in 1962, recent photos of the crash site and the crashed aircraft are included. The story of the PV-1 Ventura, "Bomber 31", pops up as a chapter here and there, interspersed throughout the book. (If you want a good history of the Alaska/Aleutian campaign, see "The Thousand-Mile War", by Brian Garfield, Doubleday & Company, 1969).Since the book was written in the new century, the author was able to draw upon Japanese and Russian sources, and the archives of American units. So, the book includes a brief history of the American action in Alaska, the story of Japanese who invaded Alaska and the story of the Japanese who were the target (e.g. Paramushiro), of the bomber campaign from Alaska. Then, there is the present day story of the investigation of the crash site of Bomber 31 on Russian territory.The author has included interviews with Japanese veterans. Chapter 15 deals with the Japanese POWs who were kept in Soviet camps in Siberia. This chapter and the five paged section on propeller damage in Chapter 16 really did not add to the story of the book, in my humble opinion. Chapter 13, "Repatriation", deals with the return of American airmen to the control of U.S. authorities, in Tehran, Iran. There are six appendices, from page 285 to page 314, followed by 12 pages of notes. Appendix 6, "Aircraft Diagrams", was interesting to me as I could see how the PV-1 Ventura (page 307) evolved into the PV-2 Harpoon (page 314). Years later, I flew in P2V-7 Neptune bombers, and you could see the Neptune in the diagrams of her "grandparents", the Ventura and the Harpoon.Years ago, my Historiography professor stated "Spell checker does not cut it".Take a look at page 170, where the Japanese aircraft "...peeled off to begin his pass". Then look at page 176, where he would "... peal off to employ..." and on page 206, "Daughtrey pealed off to begin his bomb run". Of course, the author wanted "peel" in all three sentences, not "peal" which means to ring a bell. He rang my bell and I recalled that "Spell checker does not cut it".

"Mapping Epidemics" by Brent Hoff and Carter Smith III. Subtitled: "A Historical Atlas Of Disease". Franklin Watt, A Division Of Grolier, NY. 2000.My wife and I went to Plymouth Public Library to pick out some books for "Grandma Barbara" to read to the children in our granddaughter's (Tabitha) first grade class. (Take a look at some of my more recent reviews for the books that were read.) While in the Children's Room, I noticed the book on display, "Mapping Epidemics"; the book had been catalogued as "Juvenile", J614.44.I borrowed the book. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book is a jewel. Although only 112 pages long, the book is a concise compendium of 32 different diseases that historically have caused epidemics or possibly could cause epidemics. There is a brief but comprehensive summary of each disease's history, the cause(s) of each disease and what modern medicine has done to prevent any outbreak of that particular disease. Ancient diseases are covered: plague, cholera and diphtheria. But the book is up-to-date, as the "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome", which made headlines in 1993, is also described. Although Hantavirus is associated with the rodent population in Southwest USA, I was surprised to see that the book's maps show cases in New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. All the maps are interesting, showing, for example, diphtheria problems in the Ukraine (1995-1996), E. Coli outbreaks in the United States and Ebola Fever in Africa (1972-1997).The front of the book begins with a glossary of "important terms", which will be appreciated by most readers, particularly if the reader's background is non-medical. Since my background is engineering, I was pleased to be able to flip back to the glossary to check out a term that was new to me or not clear from usage. At the other end of the book, there are four pages entitled "A Chronology Of Infectious Disease". The listing begins with the year 2700 BC (Before Christ), with "...Malaria-like symptoms" being described in a Chinese text. The last listing is for 1999 West Nile virus in metropolitan New York. Since I tend to write reviews on World War II personal memoirs, I was shocked to read, on page 34, that an unapproved vaccine (for yellow fever) caused thousands of cases of jaundice in U. S. forces during World War II.I would recommend that the Department of Homeland Security place a copy of this slim volume on the desk of each and every one of their analysts, so that those Homeland Security analysts would consider infectious diseases as Weapons of Mass Destruction. The maps in this book show that diseases from anthrax to yellow fever can be as destructive as nuclear bombs. In 1918-1919, influenza killed more people, world-wide, than were killed in World War I. (See the map on page 45 to visualize how rapidly influenza spread in the United States from beginning on 14 September 1918 until influenza covered the entire continental U.S. on 5 October 1918.) This is definitely not just a juvenile book.

Software Verification and Validation by Steven R. Rakitin. A practical book by a practical author, presenting the steps required to set up a formal and complete Verification and Validation program for software production. Mr. Rakitin sprinkles pertinent quotations throughout the book to support his case that software quality programs (detection) cost less than simply releasing a &quot;buggy&quot; program to your Customers. The author also teaches the lessons of this book at IEEE lectures; I attended one in March 1998. At these lectures, the author fleshes out and makes more interesting many of the points made in his book. As an ASQ Certified Software Engineer, S. Rakitin has the credentials to expound on many aspects of quality programs set up to deal effectively with the major &amp; crucial issue of the lack of software quality today. There are 169 pages of text, describing a good program, but the author has also included some 87 pages of appendices (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;H&quot;) which give you a cook book or recipe approach to different aspects of software quality. The author gives you good leads to other sources of information on software quality. The book would profit from another good editorial review, reducing the wordiness in some chapters and tying the whole story all together. For example, Rakitin continuously uses &quot;SEI&quot; which (as far as I can see) is not defined in his book. SEI = Software Engineering Institute. In Chapter 4, the author attempts to establish a cost/benefit justification for implementing a software quality program, but misses and then, later, on page 90 (Chapter 7), he DOES lists the pertinent reasons as, &quot;...lower support costs, ... fewer maintenance releases, ... higher customer satisfaction and, as a result, increased sales&quot;. An astute editor would have melded all of this together. Overall, this book is directed at the practitioner, whether a hardware quality engineer required to set up a software quality program, or a novice who has the same task. It is a practical book, generally well written,

Sister Wendy's Book of Saints By Sister Wendy Beckett.This is a beautiful little book (96 pages), all bright and shiny paper with brilliant colors that almost leap off the page. Sister Wendy, the nun who has made a trade mark out of her running in and out of art museums, has collected the images of saints to support both her love of art and her orthodox views on Catholicism. The book begins with St. Peter (Petrine privilege?) and works its way down to lesser-known saints.With each portrait, Sister Wendy points out an interesting tidbit. For example, with the Evangelist, St. Mark, (page 17), Sister Wendy indicates that the artist has portrayed the saint forming a cross with his pen and his sharpening knife. She lightens the mood by describing the lion, in the painting, as resembling &quot;... an imbecilic sheep gazing in wonderment...&quot; at St. Mark. This lightening of the mood is intentional as Sister Wendy repeats it (page 24) when she describes the ox in St. Luke's portrait as &quot;...an almost goofy ox&quot;.Despite this levity, Sister Wendy comes across as quite serious about both the art depicting the saints and the theology of the saints she has chosen. In summary, I would be very happy to have this book given to me.

"The Fall of Fortresses" by Elmer Bendiner, G.P. Putnam' Sons, New York, 1980.There are three themes to this book: (1) Personal Memoir (2) Refutation of Strategic Bombing and (3) Experiences of Anti-Semitism. On the first level, this is the personal story of Elmer Bendiner as a navigator in a B17 during the crucial campaign year of 1943. Mr. Bendiner relates how he became a navigator, the inconsistencies of life in the Army Air Corps and the difficulties of flying to bomb an enemy target. His writing has a light tone, almost forgiving, even when he discusses critical incidents, such as his pilot aborting too many times.The second theme begins the book, as E. Bendiner recounts the mission against Schweinfurt, August 17, 1943. Then, throughout the book, Mr. Bendiner develops a case against strategic bombing, even though, at the time, it appeared logical to strike the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt ...and all the other targets that were indispensable for the German war effort. He even quotes Albert Speer, Hitler's Minister for Production, to show that strategic bombing was not as effective as the generals were claiming.Finally, the third theme, Anti-Semitism, is implicit through out the book. Bendiner first became aware of it when, as young boy, he lived in the "...Appalachian isolation of ...Pennsylvania" and the Ku Klux Klan had as ritualistic enemies a "...handful of Jews, Catholics and very few blacks." (P. 30). You slowly become aware that Mr. Bendiner is Jewish. He even makes light of this when he relates that his "...Armenian friend, the son of a Christian minister but blessed with an aquiline nose of majestic proportions" bore the brunt of the anti-Semite jokes. (P. 37) It is only at the end of the book that you realize how important being Jewish was to E. Bendiner, as he describes walking away from an officer who had insulted "your people".This is an excellent book, well written and a worthy personal story that documents the experiences of one man in the Army Air Corps of World War II.

"Bringing Out The Dead" by Joe Connelly. Random House Audio Books, 1997. Read by Campbell Scott.Joe Connelly worked as a medic for nine years. From this experience in the Times Square area of New York City, he has developed a character, Joe Pierce, who is being consumed by his employment as an Emergency Medical Technician in the New York's Hell's Kitchen area. The description of the medical procedures used on accident victims, victims with drug overdoses and victims suffering from "mundane" problems such as cardiac arrest, are all vivid and realistic. But, beyond these often hypnotizing descriptions, the author introduces the ghosts of those whom Frank Pierce has killed ... by being too late or not being proficient. These ghosts look out windows at the main character, smile at him as he drives by in an ambulance and appear at the most awkward times. This book is more than just a repetition of medical lessons learnt.Joe Connelly sets the action in New York's Hell's Kitchen, an area historically noted for its roughness. For example, in 1863, the so-called draft riots began in Hell's Kitchen, with more than 2,000 people killed. The last time I looked, there was no hospital on 56th Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. No hospital nicknamed "Misery". There is, however, a Catholic hospital, St. Clare's, on 51st Street, between Ninth and Tenth, and I wonder if the author has used St. Clare's as the prototype for his novel. As I listened to Campbell Scott reading the book, I envisioned the ambulance going up and down the streets, and, as far as I could make out, the author has them going the correct way, for example, West towards the Hudson on 51st Street. Campbell Scott has done a good job reading this short book.

"The Dying of the Light" by Fr. James Tunstead Burtchaell. This is an enormous book, some 868 pages long. Fr. Burtchaell deals with the secularization of the Christian colleges, which, as with Harvard and Yale, changed from a church-started, church-supported institution into secular, non-sectarian schools. His method is to pick one, two or three institutions in the particular denomination and deal with the history of the changes from a religious school into a secular institution. Fr. Burtchaell has a chapter for the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans, Catholics and Evangelicals. The author's irony borders on humor once in awhile, as when he wonders why the Presbyterians found it so difficult to report the number of attending Presbyterians to church boards, but now find it so easy to report to the Federal government the racial make-up of the student body, down to the last Samoan. In the preface, Fr. Burtchaell notes that the reader will probably go directly to the section dealing with his/her religious affiliation. I did, but mainly because I was working on an MA thesis on Catholic colleges in the United States. I would recommend this encyclopaedia work to any one truly interested in the recent wave of secularization of church-related colleges in the US. Many details and stories from around the nation make this an interesting micro-history....

"The Winds Of Change" By Eugene Linden. Subtitled: "Climate, Weather And the Destruction Of Civilizations". Simon & Schuster, New York 2006.I found this book difficult to concentrate on; what is his central thesis? If the author had clearly stated that climate had killed civilizations in the past and that climate can kill in the future, it would have been sufficient. But, Eugene Linden drags in history from here and there, and mixes the history with some geological theories and then does not come to a conclusion...in my humble opinion. Are we facing another Ice Age? Or, are we going to melt away with no oxygen?For example, on pages 84 & 85, he has both the English and the Spanish using biological weapons to eliminate the hostile natives, and he quotes Alfred Crosby's book, "Ecological Imperialism", 1993, as justification. Very well. But, what has this to do with climate killing off civilizations? Then, the author appears to like the historical Norse, or Vikings, so much so that he gives us a history lesson about the Battle of Hastings, 1066. It seems that Harold on one side of the Channel, and William from the other side, were really Norsemen. Very well. And, just as my aside, the Norse founded many Irish cities, such as Dublin (988 A.D.), but this fact also has little bearing on the central thesis of this book.From an engineering point of view, if Mr. Linden would give us two graphs it would help. The first would show the dramatic changes in climate over the eons...perhaps mean temperatures or sea levels. The second graph would document the catastrophic destruction of the individual civilizations. Put one graph over the other and if there be a statistically significant correlation, then he has made his point. Right now, however, the book jumps in and out of history and into science and opinions, so that the book meanders too much.Dating: the author jumps back and forth, using C.E. for "Common Era" and then A.D., "Anno Domini." I liked the synopsis at the back of the book, "Chronology", from pages 270 to 288

"Tiffany Stained Glass Windows: 24 Cards".Edited by Alastair Duncan, Dover Publication, Mineola, NY, 1987.This is a fine booklet, 8.5" by 11", of six pages, each page having four (4) post cards. The post cards can be separated by pulling them apart along the perforations. Each post card is printed in high gloss beautiful colors. At the bottom of each card, there is a brief description of the Tiffany stained glass, which might be a brief as "Domestic Window, date unknown". Each card shows some glass window work of Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933), who was known for ability to express beautiful scenes in the medium of stained glass. Antiques Buffs would probably recognize him more for his Tiffany Lamps, which were used to shade the gas lamps of the 1880s-1890s. His stained glass windows decorated houses and mausoleums and skylights throughout the United States. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur would not take up residence at the White House until Tiffany had redecorated the building. Tiffany's stained glass entry to the White House is listed as one of his more famous works.I use the post cards in my hobby of sending and receiving post cards from individuals throughout the world. There is a website that will assign a person to send you a post card after a card, which you have sent, is received. So, after one of your mailed cards is received in, say, Germany, someone in China will be assigned to send a card to you. Nice way to collect foreign stamps! This booklet of Tiffany cards allows you to get away from the comic book post cards and the Pixar post cards, and so on.

"How The Irish Saved Civilization" by Thomas Cahill, as narrated by Donal Donnelly. 6 Audio Cassettes, Recorded Books, 1996.I had been given the book which I read on a long flight. But, I borrowed the audio tapes for the long drive on I495, especially for the slow down at the Mass Pike. Reading the book by Thomas Cahill left me somewhat dissatisfied, as Dr. Cahill's central thesis appeared disjointed and, he went on so long in making his point: that the Irish had indeed saved the writings of St. Augustine, Plato, etc., CIVILIZATION!, and copied them over and re-distributed all these works throughout Europe just at the right moment!I was surprised, however, and this is the main purpose of this review, that listening to the book really makes Dr. Cahill's point far better than reading the book! Donal Donnelly, with just the right touch of an Irish accent, reads each chapter and builds on Plato and St. Augustine, and so on, until Cahill's main concept dawns on you and you say, as you listen to the last cassette, "Right, I see that without the Irish monks and their copying, we would have had to start over again at ground zero". Perhaps the noted author and sociologist, Fr. Andrew Greeley is correct when he describes the Irish as an "oral people", who still depend more on the spoken rather than the written word.There are some drawbacks, as Mr. Donnelly struggles with the pronunciation of the French towns and monasteries begun by the Irish, and he really mutilates the Austrian name, "Salzburg". I found the chapter on St. Patrick and his conversion of Ireland to be more moving if I read it to myself, rather than listening to the audio tape reading by Donnelly. I recommend that you listen to the audio tapes after you've read the book. And, finally, it is well worth the repetition: Europe consists of more cultural backgrounds than just the Latin/Germanic mainstreams. This book deals with the neglected Celtic/Irish stream, and deserves your attention.

"Batter Up Wombat" by Helen Lester. Illustrated by Lynn Munsinger. Sandpiper Press, 2008.We were at an Italian restaurant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, when Uncle Sean asked, "What is a wombat?"Seven year-old Tabitha answered, "It's a marsupial"."A marsupial?""Yes, an animal that keeps its babies in a pouch. Most of them are from Australia".And that little conversation was the impetus for Grandma Barbara to purchase "Batter Up Wombat" for Tabitha. The book is brightly illustrated, even though I do not think that a wombat really wears clothes and is as big as he illustrated. The arrival of this Australian seemed, however, to be exactly what the "Champs" needed as these animals were at the bottom of The North American Animal League. Of course, they mistook the wombat's accent and thought he was a "Wham Bat", the hitter the team needed to get out of the League's cellar.They begin to train the Australian Wombat for American baseball, and the play on words and the illustrations are hilarious. A homonym is a word that is often spelled the same way, perhaps pronounced the same, but with different meanings. In this book, the author plays with homonyms, with, for example, a foul ball being illustrated as a chicken ...a hen...which is, of course, a fowl. This confuses the Australian wombat, but is a learning opportunity for the young reader. True, home plate is sort of a china plate, but you rarely step on a plate, and this team seldom enough gets to tag home plate on a home run. All of this continues throughout the game, and then the wombat gets his turn to hit! And, the ending is entirely unexpected, but the wombat is the hero!Great book!

"The Smell Of the Night" by Andrea Camilleri. Subtitled: "An Inspector Montalbano Mystery". Translated by Stephen Sartarelli. Penguin Books, 2005.A scam artist goes missing. Did the Mafia get rid of him? Because they were jealous of his success? Or because this relatively new scam was tapping funds the Mafia would have wanted? Or, perhaps, it was time for the scam artist to reap the rewards (however ill-gotten) of his scam and despite the fact that the scam would hurt many older and poorer people. At first, Inspector Montalbano does not want to become involved with a missing person case. The particular case at hand looked like the scam artist had bailed out with the money and gone back to mainland Italy. Missing persons. Money scams. No Sicilians involved except (of course) the victims of the scam. Page 97: "Mimi asked him:' Would you please tell me why you're getting so worked up over the Gargano Case?' "Two women! A young, cute lady who was the secretary and the older ...middle aged...good looking woman who was the office manager where the money was collected from the unsuspecting victims. Of course, murder is involved, and you'll be surprised to find out that Inspector Montalbano is an accomplished swimmer and free-diver. One body is found in the sea at the base of a cliff, but wait until you see who really got rid of the perpetuator of the scam, the initiator of the get-rich-scheme in Sicily, and where his body is found. Should Salvo Montalbano arrange the body so that the Mafia is blamed? "But he was a cop" (Page 220). All in all, this is an intriguing mystery, and, as usual, the title is not explained until you are three-fourths of the way through the book.

"The Train Ride" by June Crebbin and Stephen Lambert.I bought this book for my granddaughter, Tabitha, after we had gone on a train ride from Plymouth to Boston, Massachusetts. She clearly recognized details of our actual train ride with the same elements in the colorful illustrations and the words in the book. She sat quite still as I read this wonderful book to her. The book's author has obviously chosen her words to echo the sounds of a train: "What shall we see? What shall we see?" And, as you read the book, if you throw in a couple of extemporary "Choo-choos" , you can set up a train sound in your reading.The colors of the illustrations are bright; seems like the originals were done in pastel chalks. My granddaughter noticed that the locomotive was red, which was not the color on the train ride into Boston. The dark black of the tunnel was scary, but, on the next page, all fears were relieved when the tunnel darkness turned the window into an impromptu mirror. Tabitha laughed at the page with the words, aa"gaggle of geese", and said "gaggle" quite a few times as she tried out this new word. She was most happy to find, at the end of "The Train Ride", there was Grandma (who looked quite a bit like Mommy), waiting for them at the station. This is a most entertaining book.

"Miracle On The 17th Green" by James Patterson and Peter De Jonge. Audio Tape Version.Initially, I borrowed this tape for the long commute on 495, the ring road around Boston. I am not a golfer, but the back cover spoke about a miracle on Christmas Day so I decided to listen to the tape. After a few minutes of driving and listening, I had to pick up the plastic package to see if I had read the names of the authors correctly. Don't do that while you are driving in 495 traffic near the Mass Pike. Yes, it was James Patterson, the Manhattan College graduate (1969) and the writer of novels about terrible situations with not one, but two serial killers.The "Miracle On The 17th Green" is, however, not about a new form of serial killer, nor is it even a murder mystery. Instead, "Miracle" is an upbeat novel dealing with an advertising executive who has gone sour on his job, his marriage and, perhaps, even on life itself. On a Christmas morning, Travis McKinley is out on a nearby golf course and he discovers that, on that day, he is really hitting them like a pro. One thing builds on another and pretty soon Mr. McKinley is at Pebble Beach competing with some big-name golf pros. On the overall level, this is really a very good golf story. I wish some TV announcers could bring a wee bit of the drama to televised golf that Patterson brings to this story. I suggest, that, if need be, prepare by looking up some golf terms (such as birdie, bogie, eagle, etc.) so that the story flows and you do not have to stop for research.On another level, this is really a love story, where a man and woman, despite two disparate careers, stay together for almost three decades. The novel also deals with the human condition, as, for example, after a long career, each of us will have to look back and see if what we had done was worth it all. There may be a some autobiographical background here as James Patterson recently retired from a career as an advertising executive. The novel, however, is situated in Chicago, and Mr. Patterson is really from the New York City area.Hal Linden, who you will remember as Barney Miller in the police precinct television comedy, read the tape. It is interesting to see that a familiar voice makes listening even easier as you drive along. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a few hours of driving to do. The book is well written, a good golf story and well read to boot.

"Brigid's Cloak" by Bryce Milligan. Subtitled: "An Ancient Irish Story". Illustrated by Helen Cann. Eerdmans Books For Young Readers, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2002.Ireland is the "Isle of Saints and Scholars". Most would consider St. Patrick the premi&egrave;re saint, and many would hold St. Brigid as second among the many saints of Ireland. She was the daughter of a Druid and the legends state that she was given a magical (miraculous) cloak by a Druid priest. This nicely illustrated book describes the miracle of Brigid's cloak transporting the young servant girl, in time and place, to the Stable at Bethlehem, where Brigid was able to adore the newly born Christ Child. So, this is an idea, book to be given as a gift at Christmas time. The illustrations by Helen Cann follow a Celtic theme, and Brigid is given red hair and freckles. "Joseph gave the child to Brigid to hold ....Lovingly she held the child, then carefully laid him in the cow's hay manger". The words of author, Bryce Milligan, match the beauty of the illustrations. This is a good but different Christmas book.The legend I like best about St. Brigid also deals with her cloak. It seems that Brigid was asking the "King of Leinster" for some land for a convent. This particular man was miserly; (can an Irishman be miserly?) So, Brigid hemmed and hawed and negotiated for all the land her cloak would cover. The miserly King happily agreed to this. But, then, Brigid gave her cloak to four of her nuns and they stretched the cloak and stretched it and stretched it until the cloak covered almost all of his kingdom. The miserly King was therefore rebuked and he was happy to agree to the donation of just a few acres to St. Brigid!

"Countdown To Victory" by Barry TurnerSubtitled: "The Final European Campaigns Of World War II".HarperCollins Publishers, New York 2004.The author, Barry Turner, is British. He is fairly well known in the United Kingdom, due to his work in television and the stage. A little research on the WEB shows this and you also find the British version of this book, as the book was initially published in the UK. The British book jacket has a photo of what appears to be a surrendering German soldier. The book jacket on the American version shows four (certainly) American soldiers entering a semi-destroyed European village. The differences between the two versions of the book jacket are pictorial examples of the dichotomy in the author's writings. He wrote for both an American audience and for a British audience. I don't know about the Canadian.On the one hand, the author is trying to be objective; on the other hand, (it seems to me), he favors the British point of view. On the one hand, he implies that American General George Patton was a prima donna; on the other hand, he implies that British Field Marshal B. Montgomery was a prima donna. Both were certainly egotistical, unreasonable men, who held a high opinion of themselves. This is just one example of how the dichotomy has split the author's approach to the last months, (or so), of the war on the western front in Europe.Most of his chapters deal with the northern part of the Anglo-American thrust into Festung Europa. The book begins with a chapter on the Battle of the Bulge, with an emphasis (I think!), on the bad blood between Bradley and Montgomery. On page 69, Barry Turner quotes General Omar Bradley as saying"...Americans ...were doing all the fighting and dying in Europe with 61 divisions in the field next to 15 understrength British divisions". On page 87, the author brings up the British/American disagreement over the "broad front" approach of General Eisenhower as compared to the build up of a single, large drive (with Montgomery at its head) through northern Holland and Germany into the heart of the Reich. "Montgomery, the great war hero in Britain, had few friends in the States". So, the Allies finally ended Churchill's drive into the "soft underbelly of Europe" and moved five divisions from Italy to strengthen Eisenhower's broad drive for the Rhine. This is an example of how the entire book went.Soviet efforts are not emphasized. The Soviet advance from the East IS mentioned in the context of how it affected the Anglo-American advance in the West. Eisenhower's decision to allow the Soviets to take the capital city of the Reich, Berlin, is examined more from the influence on the aftermath of war rather than on the reduction of American casualties in the last months of the war.All in all, the author attempts to be objective, but, in my opinion leans towards the British point of view. In so doing, however, he does present a different history of the end of the war. How many times have you read about the Fifty-Third Welsh being "...spread out along the road"?Other Amazon reviewers have called Barry Turner on some American divisions...page 274...the "Thirteenth" should be the "Thirtieth", but I think that was a typo. On the same page, the author writes "US navy" which, of course, should be US Navy". See what I mean?

"Shockwave: Countdown To Hiroshima" by Stephen WalkerHarperCollins Publishers, New York 2005With an historical novel, the author knows that the reader knows what happened where and when. The task of the writer is to develop, if not suspense, at least tension with the historical facts. As you sit and read this review, you are aware that the explosion of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico dessert did not ignite the earth's atmosphere and destroy the world.Stephen Walker has used his experience as a television director to write a tense and exciting book about the bombing of Hiroshima, the first time using the atomic bomb in anger. Excellent writing; excellent story telling. For example, "Enola Gay" was the name given to the B29 bomber that carried the atomic bomb to Hiroshima. This is in most history books and caused some difficulty, recently, at the Smithsonian Institute. In the book, however, it is not until page 194 that you finally, (finally!) read how Col. Paul Tibbets named the aircraft after his mother. This is truly tension.The author gives many details: technical details (red plugs and green plugs) mixed in with the contemporary diplomatic scrambles of the Japanese to enlist the Soviet Union in the peace process. Walker presents all these details through the point of view of the American airman and the point of view of the Japanese solider in Hiroshima. With all these details, I just wonder aloud why the author did not mention that the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady was at the hypocenter in the Nagasaki attack.One editorial detail: page 201, the middle paragraph begins, "Despite the short ages and the blackout ...". Back at Bridgewater State college, my historiography professor used to say that Spell Checker does not cut it. You have to review each line, using an old wooden ruler. Spell checker permitted "...short ages..." when the author wanted "shortages". Editors at HarperCollins should pull out those rulers.

"Purgatory"; "Explained By The Lives And Legends Of The Saints", by Fr. F.X. Schouppe, S.J. Tan Books, Rockford, Illinois.This book received its IMPRIMATUR on October 11, 1893, so these writings of the Jesuit priest, F.X. Schouppe, are more than a century old. Fr. Schouppe collected and compiled the descriptions of Purgatory as recorded in the lives of saints and various holy people. Some of the saints are well known (St. Catherine of Genoa and St. Gertrude) while others are less familiar, e.g. St. Odilo, or, for example, Blessed Stephana Quinziani. The book is divided into two parts, "Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Justice" and "Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Mercy". If you read only the first part, it would, in my opinion, be very easy to lose hope. The suffering of the souls in Purgatory is real and they suffer for great things and for the least little offense. The Foreword, selected from St. Matthew's Gospel, makes Fr. Schouppe's point,"... that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall renderan account for it in the day of judgment" Matt. 12:36.The second part of the book, written, you will recall, before the 20th Century St. Faustina was born, is called "Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Mercy" and the good Jesuit author makes the point that God's charity will not be out done. In this second part of the book, as in the first, the author relates examples of "... how efficacious are the smallest prayers, the shortest supplications, to alleviate the sufferings of the poor souls". P.237. Schouppe gives examples of the efficacy of, first of all, The Mass, and then, the Rosary and the Stations of the Cross, in the relief of the suffering of souls in Purgatory. This book presents some frightening aspects of the punishment in Purgatory, thereby providing motivation for good works in this life and the earning of indulgences.Read this book to learn about Purgatory, the place.

"Sixty Days In combat" by Dean P. Joy. Subtitled: "An Infantryman's Memoir Of World War II In Europe." Presidio Press book, Random House, 2004.Born in Colorado in 1924, Dean P. Joy was almost nineteen when he volunteered for the draft in June 1943. He had just finished his freshman year in engineering at the University of Colorado, and, as with so many young men of the time, he was hoping to become a P51 Mustang pilot in the Army Air Corps. The author's poor eyesight squelched that opportunity. So, fortunately (or unfortunately), the young Dean Joy was told to take the test for the Army Specialized Training Program, ASTP. The author expected to be given military training along with his classes in engineering. In October 1943, he and one other fellow arrived at the University of Idaho, in Moscow, Idaho, for the Army Specialized Training Program. Great casualties in the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) caused the cancellation of the ASTP, and Dean Joy, along with " ...some two hundred thousand young Americans in the ASTP" were off to the "...poor bloody infantry after all". (P. 26).As luck would have it, Dean Joy is transferred to the 71st Light Infantry Division, given infantry training and training on mortars, shipped across the Atlantic to the ETO (on board the ship, " USS General Tasker Bliss"), arrived in France (which has an "ancient smell"), and then off to front for sixty days of combat, from March 10 to May 8 1945. Based upon his wife's suggestion, Mr. Joy has scattered sketches of " ...selected scenes that stick in my memory, as if my eye had been a camera" . These sketches (they look like pen and ink) liven up the details that his words describe; the sketches make the book easier to read.In reality, this book is an autobiography of a young man growing up in tough times in a tough arena. Dean P. Joy changes from a youngster, just hitting nineteen, a teetotaler and a kid afraid of girls, to an Army veteran, with the Combat Infantryman's Badge, running a bar in occupied Europe, and married to a displaced person. Perhaps the most poignant line in the book is on page 23, when the young Dean Joy recounts:"...innocent fun..." in snowy Idaho , a carefree memory ..." of the ASTP ...of a very pretty girl who ...stuffed snow down my neck. Oh, how I wanted to get to know her and ask her out on a date! But I was far too shy"

"All Politics Is Local" by Tip O' Neill, with Gary HymelPublished by Bob Adams Inc. Holbrook, Ma 1994.This small book has not been given enough respect by my fellow Amazon reviewers. Tip O'Neill, (D, Massachusetts) has compiled a concise compendium of anecdotes dealing with his sixty years experience in politics. The very definition of anecdote requires a short and condensed story making a point. Tip O'Neil, former Speaker of the House, has done just that: provided many miniature stories that succinctly illustrate a point.As Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill received more popular votes than anybody except the President and the Vice President. The President is elected by popular votes by way of the Electoral College while the House Speaker is elected by popular votes by way of the House of Representatives. This, alone, should be reason enough to study this book on politics.I was given this book by my son for Father's Day, 1997, and ever since then I have been "sensitive" to the term, "All Politics Is Local". I suggest to my fellow reviewers that they count how many times generals and TV commentators use the term, "All Politics Is Local" when they are describing the nation building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.Further, this book should be read again and again by the 535 members of Congress. Example: On page 162, Mr. O'Neill tells about Fr. Robert Drinan, S. J., being concerned about wearing his Roman collar on the floor of the House. Tip O' Neill recommended to the priest-congressman that he just be himself and walk around with his collar. Don't you think that the current Speaker of the House, R. Dennis Hastert, (R. Illinois) would have profited from reading that anecdote? If he had read this book, Speaker Hastert would have been prepared for the recent election of a Catholic priest as Chaplain of the House, and Hastert would not have been embarrassed by worrying about a person in a Roman collar walking around on the floor of the House. It had already been done! Too bad Speaker Hastert had not given this book more respect.

Scenes From The End by Frank E. Manuel, published by Steerforth Press, 2000.If you are looking for the usual reminiscences where an old soldier describes his Sherman tank cracking a curbstone in Prague in 1945 and seeing the same crack in 1995, then this book is NOT for you. Manuel's present memoirs, on the end of World War II in Europe, are written in a literate style by a man literate, not only in English, but also in French, German and Yiddish. Frank E. Manuel begins his book with the Battle of the Bulge, but he really does not see much action. The central theme of his book is not, however, about military action, but rather the feelings and motivation of the enemy soldiers he interrogated. The POWs ranged in rank from private to general. Mr. Manuel describes their attitudes and personal attributes when captured. A particularly notable chapter is Chapter 8, entitled, "A Houseful of Generals", where , in a the town of Weilheim, many of the German generals and their staff decided to stop running from the advancing American armies. This chapter is a literate rebuttal of the German offer to become allies with the Anglo-Americans to keep the Mongol-Bolsheviks out of Western Europe. Of course, this offer was rejected, and Frank Manuel states, "We wanted the Germans to say that they were ashamed of themselves", p. 97. His next-to-last chapter is on his encounter with Admiral Horthy, Regent of Hungary, when he and the Admiral are transported to General Patch's headquarters. He describes the Admiral's ineffectual attempts to break with his German allies, as the War comes towards its end. The quote Mr. Manuel uses is, "Was konnte ich denn machen?", in English, "What could I do?" These are the words he also uses to end this chapter.Throughout this book, Frank Manuel is well aware of his own Jewishness and how others could identify him as being a Jew. The author senses that old Admiral Horthy knew that he was Jewish, and Horthy gave a monologue on "...his protection of Hungarian Jews and his refusal to participate in their round-up by the Nazis". P. 120. The author also relates how Polish officers questioned him, in Yiddish, about being a Jew. But, in all of this, Frank Manuel is not, as far as I can read, defensive about being Jewish. In describing the fate of the Poles, he states that "...they would wander the earth like the Jews and the Irish". P. 71. In this single line, the author shows a deeper understanding of the many diasporas (Irish, Jewish or Polish) than many who believe in a monopoly of persecution, suffered only by their own kind. This book is well worth your time.

I"In Enemy Hands" by Claire Swedberg.Subtitled: "Personal Accounts Of those Taken Prisoner In World War II".Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, 1997.This book recounts the prison stories of five people, four men and one woman. During World War II, Oscar Smith and Robert Salmon were prisoners of the Japanese and their stories are exceedingly different. Edward Uzemack, an American, was captured by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge and he had to survive in a German POW camp until the end of the war in Europe. On the other side, Hermann Pfrengle was a young German who avoided the Red Army to be intentionally captured by American soldiers. Finally, the woman, Helga Wunsch, from what was called East Germany, was imprisoned by the Soviets for political reasons.All of these stories illustrate Man's inhumanity to Man. The story of Oscar Smith was the hardest to read, not because of the writing but due to the difficult subject. Japanese culture did not inhibit inhumanity to prisoners of war. In fact, the second story, the case of the British subject, Robert Salmon, illustrates this point. The Western prisoners from Shanghai were under a Japanese Commandant who had studied in the United States and had been in the Japanese consulate in Seattle. (Page 100). The name of the Japanese commandant is never given in this book (as far as I could see). Undoubtedly the commandant's exposure to Western culture inhibited Japanese inhumanness and turned Salmon's incarceration into a term of boredom rather than a struggle to avoid starvation and to survive.Edward Uzemack was a reporter for the "Chicago Tribune" until 1943, when, despite his poor vision, he was drafted into the United States Army. He ended up in the 28th division, the "Keystone Division", just in time to meet the Nazi thrust through the Ardennes, commonly known as the Battle of the bulge, 1944. Uzemack was captured and spent the rest of the war in German POW camps.The young German boy, Hermann Pfrengle, had a similar story to that of Uzemack. The German, Pfrengle, led his young compatriots West, so as to surrender to the American Army. They all dreaded capture by the Red Army. The American Army, however, did not treat the young German POWs very well. Not only was food not available, but there was little water. Conditions for Pfrengle were just about as bad as those endured by the American POW, Uzemack. Pfrengle's ability in English allowed him to communicate with the American guards, which eventually resulted in the early release of the boy-soldiers.Perhaps the most unjust imprisonment was that of the woman. The German, Helga Wunsch, was arrested by the Soviets as a spy when the war ended and imprisoned for eight years, despite her not being guilty of anything. Her treatment showed that inhumanity knows no political boundary.Each story was gathered from personal interviews and original memoirs, and the writing is excellent. The author's emphasis, in my humble opinion, is on the individual's will to survive, in environments where cruelty and illogical conditions are commonplace, and the individual has done nothing to deserve such treatment.

"Magnificent Corpses", by Anneli Rufus, sub-titled, " Searching Through Europe For St. Peter's Head, St. Chiara's Heart, St. Stephen's Hand And Other Saints' Relics". Marlowe & Company, New York, 1999.According to her "Introduction", Anneli Rufus was a Jewish child who was always intrigued by the practice of the collection and veneration of relics in the Christian church. As a child, she liked to read the Lives of the Saints. Her book is not just an unbeliever's examination of the idiosyncrasies of the Faithful in the belief in the efficacy of relics. Her writing is so unbecoming that it borders, in my opinion, on being nasty. In her first chapter, "So Many Maidens", on St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins, she writes about the maidens: "...so much long silky hair and so many quarts of menstrual blood". (Page 12). Unbecoming! In writers' conferences, I have been taught that every written word should advance your central theme. What do "...quarts of menstrual blood" have to do with incorruptible corpses scattered as relics a round Europe? Where was the author's editor? Nasty.This tone of writing continues throughout. Later in the book the author describes being assailed by bad breath in one church. Personally, I have encountered bad breath on the subways of NYC and in the underground of London, but I do not think that descriptions of these encounters would advance a written travelogue on these two tourist cities. In describing the clothes tourists wear, the author makes a case for some formal tourist dress code, particularly, perhaps, for American tourists, but, then again, does this advance the central theme of the book? What does the dress of the visitors has to do with the practice of dismembering the bodies of Saints so that each little village can have their own relic? Where was the editor?Henry VIII beheaded St. Thomas More (1478-1531). More's body is buried under the chapel at the Tower of London. His head was stuck on a pike for all to see, but his daughter lovingly took the head away in the dark of night. Anneli Rufus might have written a better book if she had spent her time documenting where the head of this English Saint is rather than writing about menstrual blood, bad breath and graffiti. For the reader truly interested in the strange phenomenon of bodies that do not decay, along with practice of venerating such saintly relics, I would recommend the book, "The Incorruptibles", by Joan C. Cruz, Tan Books, 1991.

"The Last Stand Of The Tin Can Sailors" by James D. Hornfischer. Subtitled "The Extraordinary World War II Story Of The U.S. Navy's Finest Hour". Bantam Books, 2004.From the biographical information on the WEB, it does not appear that the author, James Hornfischer, served in the Untied States Navy; this makes his book even more of an amazing accomplishment. He has absolutely captured the essence of an enlisted man in the US Navy, so much so that I can smell the gray paint (oil-based) that we slopped around the compartment in the Naval Air Training Center, Norman, Oklahoma. I can still remember the Chief warning us not to let the paint go on too thick as the paint would burn during action. ...As if we would ever see a battle in NATTC, Norman, which was about as far from either ocean as you could get. I was there as an Airedale in 1958, and, being Irish, I was proud of the Kelly green diagonal stripes on my dress blue jumper. In my opinion, Hornfischer has captured the quintessence of the feeling or disdain that the black shoe navy had for aviation, the brown shoe navy. The author has taken all these minimal details and woven a real and personal story of the men who served in the little "Taffy" fleet that was attacked by Imperial Japanese Navy that day in October, 1944.First, he has addressed what the noted historian, John Keegan, was not willing to consider in his book, "The Face of Battle" (Viking Press, 1995):personal courage in naval actions. In at least three places in "Tin Can Sailors", Hornfischer tells how it feels to be going into action where the chances of survival are nil. Yet they went: courage to stay at your station and to continue to load and fire despite the odds. Second, his detailed account of the action makes a good case for the fact that the Imperial Japanese Navy withdrew, NOT because they had misidentified the USN ships they were facing but rather because Japanese ships had been damaged so much. This book gives a detailed account of the damage inflicted by the destroyers (both DD and DE) and by the naval aircraft that were constantly strafing and bombing the Japanese ships. Even American (or British) admirals would hesitate if so many of their vessels had been so damaged.Last, and it seems fitting in this book, the author only briefly mentions Admiral "Bull" Halsey. Halsey's misinterpretation of the strategic situation led to the potential disaster in Leyte Gulf; the heroism of the ordinary seamen prevented the disaster while writing a chapter of bravery. for the United Sates Navy.

"How To Start & Manage A Used Bookstore Business" by Jerre G. Lewis and Leslie D. Renn. Subtitled: "A Practical Way to Start Your Own Business". Business $ Professional Publishing, Interlochen, Michigan. 1999.This is a concise book, 8/12 inches by 11 inches. The first 67 pages, or so, are devoted to the development of a "BUSINESS PLAN"! What are the monthly expenses? What is the projected monthly income? What is the cost of goods sold? The authors have done a nice, concise job of laying out a business plan for the ordinary reader. It would appear that they have used this "boiler-plate" for some 100 or more books, all on starting your own business, from an apparel store down to a coin-operated laundry. After the business plan section, the authors have added a few appendices which deal, peripherally, with selling books. These appendices are somewhat tailored to each of the different business that the authors want to address. Good for them.But. If you want to ascertain if it is possible to open a small place to sell your college books (ancient), your wife's college books, the books that your four children left behind after college and grad school, and so on, this present book is barely tolerable. Add to all this, that many, if not most, book sellers are emphasizing the WEB, then the single page addendum on "What makes a good web site?" does not cut it.Three stars were assigned for the rather complete but generic approach to a business plan. "Fail to plan, plan to fail".Copyrighted in 1999, this edition of this book is out of date since,in my opinion, it does not address the major impact that the Internet has had on book selling, used books or new books.

"In The Hands Of My Enemy" by Sigrid Heide. Sub-titled: "One Woman's Story Of Word War II. Southfarm Press, Middletown, Connecticut.1996.This book was originally published in Norwegian in 1946, directly after the events of the Second World War. This is a recent translation and publication in English. The author had suffered at the hands of the Nazis in Norway, when she was captured as part of the underground resistance. The first 183 pages of this book recounts the author's capture, her imprisonment, her beatings and sufferings ... for years, all in a prison in Norway. Then, the book ends at the time when she was transferred into Germany and later to camps in Austria. There are some ten pages, at the back of the book, which recount the rest of her captivity, and her final release into freedom. I just wish that she had presented the entire story in one volume. Splitting the story into two volumes made the work in the first volume "incomplete".

"Among The Dead Cities" by A. C Grayling. Subtitled: " The History And Moral Legacy Of The WWII Bombing Of Civilians In Germany And Japan." Walker & Company, New York 2006This book is a mix of history, philosophy and morality, dealing with the area aerial bombing by the Allies in the Second World War. In the front matter, there is a list of 20 books, all written or edited by A. C. Grayling, and dealing, generally, in one way or another, with philosophical matters. This current title, "Among the Dead Cities", is not, however, the author's first attempt on mixing philosophy with history. In this book, he recounts the Royal Air Force efforts in the bombing of Nazi occupied Europe, with an emphasis on the bombing of Hamburg, Germany, (Operation Gomorrah, July-August 1943) and the subsequent fire storm that killed some many innocent Germany civilians. He also states that he does not want to deal with the bombing of Dresden, February 1945. Among the book's conclusions are that the RAF was morally wrong to mount attacks with the express purpose of terrorizing the civilian population. Further, he concludes that "precision bombing" (as generally attempted by the USAAF Eight Air Force) was more effective in ending the war than was the so-called area bombing or "obliteration bombing".There are a few chapters dealing with the morality of bombing, bringing in the Principle of Double Effect and the requirements for a Just War, as set forth by St. Thomas Aquinas.(1225-1274). While I was studying engineering at a Catholic college, prior to Vatican II, I was exposed to Scholasticism and the Principle of Double Effect. I would suggest that our esteemed author has flawed his argument by neglecting the Luftwaffe attacks on the Soviet Union. As an engineer, I am used to holding certain factors constant while watching what happens to a single variable. This is what Grayling does when he does not want to consider the guilt of the German Nation for the concentration camps where some 12 million people died. But, the Luftwaffe bombing on the Eastern Front is exactly what Grayling's book is about. The Nazi German war efforts included killing as many civilians as did the RAF and USAAF.I was surprised that the author, A. C. Grayling, on page 43, has the invasion of Russia beginning in May 1941, when the historical date was June 22 1941. Even though the author quotes Frederick Taylor's book, "Dresden" (Harper-Collins, 2004) on pages 258-259, Grayling does not dig deep enough. On page 411 of "Dresden", Frederick Taylor states, "It is rarely mentioned that almost exactly the same number of Soviet citizens died as a result of bombing during the Second World War as (did) Germans: around half a million". Then Taylor recounts the Luftwaffe's "..."thousand-bomber raid" ...on Stalingrad. From an engineering point of view, i.e. form fit and function, it appears the German air force, the Luftwaffe, was able to perform as well as the RAF in "area bombing". By neglecting the Eastern Front, Grayling has introduced a historical and philosophical flaw into his analysis.In my humble opinion, the "proportionate response" of the RAF , by area bombing cities and civilians, was equal to and reactive to the same efforts of the Luftwaffe on the Eastern Front (neglected by so many Western historians). In other words, the Allies' air forces did exactly what the Nazi air force did.Finally, look at page 138: "...and was so jealous of it that it refused to share it even with its British friends". Oh! What he is writing is that the USAAF was so jealous "...of it (the Norden bomb sight) that it (the USAAF) refused to share it (the Norden bomb sight) with its (the USAAF) British friends". Too many pronouns! Three stars for this effort.

"The Railway Man", by Eric Lomax, W.W. Norton, 1995. This is a well written and well edited book, telling the personal story of Eric Lomax, who was Prisoner of War held by the Japanese during World War II. The author's personal accounting of torture, beating and maltreatment of POWs by the Japanese is a cool condemnation in black type on white paper of the inhuman treatment common in the Pacific. Lomax's almost causal recounting of how he was tortured makes that section even more difficult to read.The title, "The Railway Man", comes from the author's life long obsession with the railroads and locomotives. His observations of railroads and locomotives makes some of the more vivid writing in his autobiography. His personal journey from hatred of the Japanese translator, who participated in prisoners' torture, to forgiveness of that person, marks one of the highlights of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes the Japanese acted in a civilized manner in the war they started in the Pacific.

"The Eternal Frontier" by Tim Flannery, sub-titled "An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples." Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001.An in-depth history of the continent of North America, with tidbits from South America, Australia and Eurasia thrown in. The book traces the ecological history of the Continent down to the present, with an emphasis on the disappering or changing frontier.The author, an Australian professor, despite his Irish surname, describes the changes in the fauna (and somewhat the flora) of North America over the past 65 millions year, from the crashdown of the comet that destroyed the dinosaurs to the arrival of mankind and down to the present age, with the influx of immigrants, mainly from Europe. Professor Flannery takes for granted the theory of the movement of continental landmasses over the eons, the destruction of an entire order of creation by the smashing effects of a comet (asteroid?) and the arrival of the first humans about 13,200 years. Interestingly, Flannery is not afraid to be politically incorrect, as he ascribes the destruction of the mammoths, mastodons and other large animals (including the giant sloths and horses) to the arrival and expert skill of the first humans, the ancestors of today's Native Americans. These "Clovis Points" hunters were so expert that in a short three centuries they rid both North and South America of these largest animals in what Flannery describes as "a megafauna barbecue". He has a way with words, and every now and then puts in some Australian usage, e.g. "wonky".In his description of evolution of the animals on North America, Dr. Flannery makes it clear that dogs "(family Canidae) are a true production of North America". After describing the dogs and their North American evolution, he addresses the cheetah, belonging to the only genus of living cats that may have originated in North America. On p. 115, he writes a memorable statement, "What is a cheetah but a cat trying to be a dog?" The Professor's insight is different than most of my college and university teachers!As the book gets close and closer to the present time, the chapters become shorter and shorter. He spends some time describing the political and stylish differences between the New England colonies and Virginia, with an emphasis on how a New World weed, tobacco, would shape Virginia's history, leading to plantations and "egalitarianism". He terms the American War of Independence "...a bitter struggle, a true civil war", which, with his Irish surname, I would not expect. The Irish immigrants in the American Continental Army, and the German settlers in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York definitely did not consider the Revolution to be civil war between Englishmen.The book is well written, and well documented, with pages 358 to 385 devoted to Notes and books referenced. Flannery certainly gives you a different point of view on North America!

"Wrack. A Novel" by James Bradley.Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1998.A novel set in Australia, about two love stories that take place fifty years apart, brought together by the common theme of the search for the Portuguese ship, the first European vessel to discover Australia.In the late 1930s, just before World War II erupted, Kurt and Veronica became involved. Veronica Marshall was upper class, and Kurt Seligman a poor student. Kurt worries about the condition of his poor clothes, his inability to pay the lunch tab, etc., but Veronica ignores all of that. They become lovers. But then, Veronica marries Fraser McDonald. Not only has Kurt lost Veronica, his lover, but, of all things, she has become the wife of his thesis advisor! Heaven help us.The second love story is between David and Claire and set in the 1990s. David is a widower and Claire, a medical doctor, has just moved back after a failed affair. In some sense, then, both individuals are on the "rebound". Fortunately, Claire, as a doctor, is available to keep the old man, Kurt, medicated and alive as David attempts to pry the secret from him of the Portuguese ship.And the ship is the central unifying theme of this book. Sixty plus years ago, Fraser McDonald and Kurt Seligman were looking for the wreck of the Portuguese mahogany ship that was rumored to have sailed around the continent of Australia. In the 1990s, David is looking for the same vessel. Kurt is dying and Claire assists David by keeping the old man, Kurt, both alive and lucid.The story jumps back and forth between Kurt/Veronica and David/Claire, with side explanations of the Portuguese exploration of Africa, India and the Orient. Did a Portuguese vessel actually make the journey from Goa, India, down to the then unknown continent of Australia? Was the Portuguese red mahogany wreck buried in the beach sands and did Kurt know the location? While developing both love stories, the author also finds it necessary to develop the history of map making, and to give a synopsis of Portuguese exploration contemporary with Columbus and other explorers of Spain. The brief history of Portuguese exploration by James Bradley in this novel is better than most text books, where Spanish exploration dominates the pages. (A recent example of this emphasis on Spanish exploration is: "The Discovery of Mankind: Atlantic Encounters in the Age of Columbus" by David Abulafia.)So, in this novel you get two love stories, an introduction to maps, a synopsis of the history of Portuguese exploration, the Australians in Singapore as the Japanese advance down the peninsula, and it all begins with the discovery of a mummified body in the beach sands. Read the book to find out if the Portuguese wreck is found.

"The Amazing Secret of the Souls in Purgatory" by Sister Emmanuel of Medjugorje. Book's subtitle is "An Interview With Maria Simma". Queenship Publishing company, Goleta, CA 1997.This is a very short (58 pages) book, relating the interview of Maria Simma, a devout Catholic, who, for many years, has visits from the souls in Purgatory. These souls will ask Maria Simma to have prayers said for them: a Mass, or a Rosary, or the Stations of the Cross. The author, Sister Emmanuel, interviewed Maria Simma through an interpreter, and," for the sake of brevity and clarity" (page 3), Sister Emmanuel summed up some of Maria's answers.This book is not a summary of the Church's doctrine on the issue of Purgatory. Rather, the book recounts the answers of Maria Simma to the questions asked by Sister Emmanuel. That Maria Simma has been visited by the souls from Purgatory is confirmed by incidents (not fully documented in this book) of a deceased person relating details to Maria Simma, and her telling the family of the deceased these details. Maria would have all the details concerning the field, or the exact amount of money, or the property and..."the family would be staggered to discover that she knew all these details". (p. 38)For anyone wanting to discover what Purgatory is like, this small book gives a description of that place by one woman who has had visions for most of her life. Maria must be approaching her 90s, since she was listed as 82 in the year of publication (1997).The last few pages are a call to prayer for the souls in Purgatory by the author, Sister Emmanuel. The book is well worth the small price, and ... delivered the book quickly.

Extra Special Personal Memoir."Visions From A Foxhole" by William A. Foley, Jr. Subtitled "A rifleman In Patton's Ghost Corps". Ballantine Books, NY 2003.This is the story of a young man, seeking to find himself, while at the same time he is defending his country. His father had served in world War I, and William A. Foley, Jr., is not only learning about himself during his time in the European Theatre of Operations but also about his father's experience in the First World War. Foley, Jr., as a lower ranking soldier, is part of the 94th Infantry Division which went through some heavy fighting, for example, in the Ruhr, crossing the Saar River and then crossing the Rhine River. His written personal recollections are made all the more vivid by his drawings.Almost for relief, Foley had begun to draw, in pencil on paper, the scenes of war, as he experienced them He realized that he had more talent than most people, so he began to accumulate and protect his drawings from action to action, town to town, river to river. Despite dunkings in rivers, shellings, winter weather and so much more, the author saved most of his drawings and presented a selection in this book. These contemporary drawings confirm the harshness of the battle. The drawings combined with his written words makes this an extra special personal memoir. The author also has a web site, tied in with the title of the book.Just as an aside, my Professor in Historiography once stated that "Spell checker" has ruined many an editor. On page 139, the book states that the author "...sneaked a peak {sic}"... while in other pages of the book, he was sneaking a "peek", the proper spelling for looking discretely. On page 209, the Greek letter "Pi" appears before the date "16 March". Spell Checker ignores Greek Letters. Don`t let this distract from your enjoyment of this excellent book. ...

"Grave Secrets" by Kathy Reichs. CD Audio Version read by Katherine Borowitz.Kathy Reichs is well know for writing novels that employ her in-depth knowledge of forensic analysis to surprise, sometimes shock and often stimulate the reader. The latest book, "Grave Secrets", however is like a large kitchen with too many cooks and too much to eat. You snack something here and snicker something there and soon, you have lost the edge of your hunger, but you are NOT satisfied."Grave Secrets" begins with the assignment of Tempe Brennan to a burial site in a small village in Guatemala where government death squads have killed all the women and children, Brennan's assignment is to document the deaths, the mode(s) of killing and the calendar time of death. Some of her co-workers are killed in an ambush, and this later appears to be an assassination attempt on Tempe Brennan. In the middle of this, because of her experience and her writing of papers on the subject, Brennan is asked to assist in the exhumation and identification of human remains in a septic system. Then, the over-sexed Canadian ambassador to Guatemala appears to be involved and his daughter is missing. Tempe flies back to Montreal with the Ambassador's wife, where the missing daughter has been found, but, in my opinion, this visit to Montreal really does not advance the plot. The trip does permit Tempe to meet with Andrew Ryan, a romantic interest.The next plot line involves stem cell research, and there is a substantial tutorial on embryonic stem cell research and the potential for help to victims of diseases such as Parkinson's. At least twice, the author has her characters describe President George W. Bush's decision on limiting stem cell "lines' as wrong. Finally, in the next to last chapter after an unbecoming description of an attack of diaherra (where later proves to be caused by drugs slipped into a soda can), Tempe Brennan resolves all the plot lines. The last chapter is tinged with romance as Tempe tries to decide between Andrew Ryan and a Spanish version, nicknamed "The Bat", who had gone to college with Andrew Ryan.There was just too much going on, too quick a resolution of the twisted plot lines and then, the novel changed from a mystery "who dun it" into a romance. The overall book did not satisfy me. The reader, Katherine Borowitz, was excellent and handled both the French names in Montreal and the Spanish names in Guatemala City with appropriate accents. I enjoyed listening to her as I commuted on 495, the ring road around Boston.

"Grandfather's Tale", by Timothy Erenberger, Sub-titled, "The Tale of a German Sniper" Writer's Club Press, San Jose, 2000.This is a work of fiction, detailing the war reminiscences of a German soldier who, at eighty years old, wants someone, his great grandson, George Frick, to know how it was in the Second World War. Although the Grandfather, Jeorg Frick, is now an American citizen, he was a born in Germany (Deutschland) and drafted into the Wehrmacht when he was young. The author then has the grandfather recounting his experiences of war, along with much of the horrors, to his young grandson. The book begins with the young boy visiting his Great-grandfather and seeing that the old man can really shot! One thing leads to another, and then the Grandfather decides to tell the young boy about the German Army medals and the collection of war memorabilia.On this foundation, the writer, Tim Erenberger, spins a tale of German soldier fighting his way through many of the major battles of the Second World War. The point of view is that of a drafted German, who would have been content to stay at home in a bakery, but who is discovered to have a natural ability for marksmanship. The author puts this Grandfather in the invasion of Poland (September 1, 1939), and then into the elite German paratroops, has him land on the Belgian fortress of Eben Emael (May 10, 1940), and continue through France, drop in on Crete (where the German paratroops were cut to pieces) and to the war in Russia. In the main portion of the book, as the German Panzer forces crash through the great breadth of Mother Russia, the book slows down, in continuous but similar action, killing here, advancing, and then shooting more there. After the effects of the first winter in Russia, the book again seems to go through much the same, as the Germans fight much the same battle after battle, when they retreat out of immense frozen Russian landscape.Timothy Erenberger has accomplished a major feat here: his book is a believable depiction of the common soldier's life as he fights his way back and forth over much of Europe, against American, Belgian, British, French, and Russian soldiers. Only three stars were awarded, as this book has a few obvious errors (such as the Battle of the Bulge beginning on December 6th 1994, instead of December 16th), which would have been cleaned up by an astute and knowledge editor. For example, page 372 has opened the parenthesis on (Commonly called a "Luger"), but the parentheses are not closed in the book. An astute editor would have known that the 30-caliber ammunition for an American M1 rifle would not fit the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), which takes 45 caliber. Even a German soldier on the run would be able to notice such a difference. Little things, such as these, slow down the enjoyment of the book. I purchased this book from Amazon, for my son, a former Marine, who enjoyed the book. All in all, this book packs many of the horrific experiences that a German soldier probably had, fighting in World War II.

"Practicing History", by Barbara W. Tuchman, sub-titled "Selected Essays". Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 1981.This book is a collection of essays written by the noted Historian, Barbara W. Tuchman (e.g. "The Guns of August"), over the course of her long career. In my humble opinion, for the novice historian, the most interesting essays are, "The Historian as Artist" (pages 45-50), "The Historian's Opportunity", (pages 51-64). In these two essays, Ms. Tuchman challenges the budding historian to not only collect facts, dates and events, but rather to write History so the end product is as engaging as modern novel, BUT, based upon excellent scholarship. Ms. Tuchman is a proponent of "narrative" History, where the facts "...require arrangement, composition planning just like a painting - Rembrandt's 'Night Watch`" (page 49). These two essays would enhance any course in Historiography.Some of her remaining essays are a bit dated, but provide keen insight into the times, as in Tuchman's "Japan: A Clinical Note", (pages 93-97). Her essays on Israel tend to be a bit chauvinistic, in the sense that the author's objectivity slips and she can find very little wrong with the budding Jewish state in what was once Palestine. The essay, "Perdicaris Alive or Rasuli Dead" (pages 104-117), is very entertaining, particularly if you are interested in New York's Teddy Roosevelt. All in all, the first section of this book, (called "The Craft"), includes essays that should be required reading for a student beginning graduate work in History.

"The Faustball Tunnel". By John Hammond Moore. Subtitled: "German POWs In America And Their Great Escape". Random House, New York, 1978.When I pulled this book from the library shelf, my rudimentary German told me that the title was "The Fistball Tunnel". When I looked in my German/English dictionary, I found that "Faustball" was a form of volleyball, and this, naturally, was explained in the beginning text of the book. I should have started to read the book in the library.It seems that German Prisoners of War (POWs) had the same ideas as their British counterparts on the other side of the world. The German POWs were mainly maritime individuals: either Kriegsmarine or German Merchant Marine. In their prison in Arizona, these German sailors hit upon the idea of building a volleyball court so as to hide the dirt that was coming up from the tunnel they were building. "Hide in plain sight". This was quite similar to what some British were doing in their prison camp in Germany (see "The Great Escape" by Paul Brickhill). However, the German escape into the Arizona desert was NOT made into a major motion picture.In the Arizona camp, the American Army guards were lackadaisical, to say the least. Some Germans escaped. The German escapees were surprised by the distances involved, and Arizona is not as big as Texas! Further, they were surprised to find people who did not speak English, but spoke Spanish. In this regard, I wonder why the Germans wanted to escape to Mexico, a country that was also at war with Nazi Germany; the German POWs were at greater risk inside Mexico than they were in the U.S. Interestingly, after their recapture, the German sailors learnt that the buzzing noise in the desert was the sound of rattlesnakes shaking their warning tails and that rattlesnakes are dangerous. All in all, the German escapees were as deficient in their knowledge of North America as the contemporary American/British escapees were about Europe.

"Old Man In Baseball Cap" by Fred Rochlin. Subtitled: A Memoir Of World War II. Originally Published by Harper Collins, 1999.Large Print: Thorndike Press, 2000.This book is a collection of anecdotes: "War Stories". When I served in the United States Navy, there was always an "Old Salt" who would tell "Sea Stories". "I've worn out more sea bags than you've worn out socks". War Stories. Fred Rochlin served as a B-24 navigator, flying over Italy in World War II. This book is a collection of his memories and his war stories.The first chapter, "Milk Run To Genoa" would probably be of most interest to readers who are looking for action. Although the mission was considered an easy "milk run", Rochlin's B-24 Liberator was hit by flak, which blew away a portion of the bomber's nose. When Rochlin, as navigator, regained consciousness, he saw that Hughes, the nose gunner, was gone and his friend, Shorty, was missing his head. This milk run was Rochlin's introduction to the bombing campaign in Italy.There is a story about an Italian woman having an extremely difficult time giving birth, and Fred Rochlin, with his Spanish from Arizona, acts as a translator from the American doctor's English into Italian. Blood is everywhere, but the baby is born. They name the baby after the doctor and Rochlin. There is also a story of Rochlin's experience being shot down, wounded and walking out of enemy territory back into Allied control. Then, there is the homosexual element. One night, Lieutenant Rochlin is invited to a card game, where everybody is a high ranking officer. Soon, the author realizes that he is there as the "date" for the Colonel. The author begs off, goes down to his tent but is pursued by the Colonel. See pages 135-139 in the Large Print text.One of the interesting comments that the writer makes is on page 34. Rochlin states that WASPs were sent to pilot school, while airmen with Scandinavian or German names were sent to bombardier schools. Irish, Italian and Polish kids were trained as gunners. Jewish kids were taught to be navigators. I thought that this was another of the author's war stories. I had read "Sitting It Out" by David Westheimer, (Rice University Press, 1992), who also wrote "Von Ryan's Express "and a collection of other good books. From the Plymouth Public Library, I borrowed "Sitting It Out", Westheimer's story of being a POW in World War II, and thumbed through that book to reaffirm my memory. Sure enough, Westheimer was Jewish, as he threw away his dog tags marked with "H" and Westheimer WAS the navigator in his B-24 that was shot down in Italy. Perhaps there is some truth in Rochlin's memory of the assignment rules for Army Air Force trainees...

This review is for the audio tape, which I listened to on my daily commute on 495. In &quot;Serpent: The NUMA Files&quot;, Clive Cussler tests your credulity far too much. At the book's beginning, Cussler wants us to believe that a seaman, with a long scar from eye to lips, is the major cause of the ramming of the Andrea Dora by the Stockholm. This scar-faced fellow shows up again, 30-40 years later. He's there to protect the claim of Columbus to be first in the New World! Further, the author wants you to believe that the many disappearances of archaeologic teams over the last few decades resulted from the actions of an old organization, &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;. The Brotherhood is an outgrowth of the Spanish Inquisition, thus requiring you to believe in the discredited &quot;Black Legend&quot; of Spain's colonial history. All this conspiring makes you wonder why The Brotherhood did not kill Harvard Professor Barry Fell before he could publish his book, &quot;America B.C.: Ancient Visitors ...&quot;. Professor Fell claims the the Libyans, Phoenicians and Celts were all here in the centuries before Christ. Oh well, The Brotherhood would also have to dispose of all the school chridren who are taught that the Vikings preceded Columbus by about 500 years. Finally, towards the end of the book, the author introduces the head of The Brotherhood who has a modern revision of group's mission for the scar-faced sailor: they will not only defend Columbus' claim to be first but they will also defend accomplishments of the native population. For example, the Mayans developed a wonderful calendar. This was just too much for my credibility quotient. I popped out the tape and went back to listening to NPR.

"Soldiering For Freedom" by Herman J. Obermayer.Subtitled: "A GI's Account Of World War II.Texas A& M University, Military History Series, 98. (2005).This book is a personal memoir that is different from most. Herman J. Obermayer, at the age of eighteen, was drafted in June 1943. From his entry into the Army at the New Cumberland Army Reception Center, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania until his return from Europe to the United States on the ship, "Colby Victory", he wrote his parents. His last letter is dated March 30, 1946. These letters, collected during the war years, formed the foundation for this book. At first, I thought I would not like the format of printed edited versions of Obermayer's letters, but then, I found that the author has woven the letters into a sort of personal and contemporary commentary on the events that were occurring at the date of each letter. So, for example, you will find his letters from the College of William and Mary, where Obermayer trained in the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), intertwined with a rather detailed explanation of the Army Specialized Training Program, its goals, and that the fact that some 150,000 GIs were assigned to some 222 colleges and universities as ASTP students, and, for completeness, a brief history of the College. Due to his high score on the Army General Classification Test, Herman Obermayer was initially assigned to ASTP, so the former Dartmouth student entitled this chapter as "Back To College As A Soldier".Basic training, troopship crossings and awaiting combat are all dealt with in individual chapters, which, again, mix Obermayer's contemporary correspondence with succinct summaries of the status of the war in the European Theater of Operations, ETO. An interesting chapter deals with the war against the French, our nominal allies, who were robbing gasoline from the American pipelines. On pages 100-101, the author gives an incidence of the French actually sabotaging a train, resulting in the death of some 200 American soldiers. "Censorship kept the news of this event out of the U.S. press." Even today, the there is little written about it.The author has provided B&W; contemporary photos of himself, his friends and some of interesting events he describes in the book. Additionally, the author has prepared an interesting map, showing his World War II trek across the ETO, and then marking the places he visited, including Paris, the Riviera and Geneva, Switzerland, where he was a student after the end of hostilities. This is an interested and very detailed book.

"To Lose A War" by Regina Maria Shelton. Subtitled: "Memories Of a German Girl". Southern Illinois University Press, 1982.This is a very personal memoir of a young German girl, growing up during the Second World War. Born in 1927, Regina Maria was just reaching womanhood when the Soviet tanks were entering eastern Germany: Silesia, Pomerania, Prussia, etc. She begins the book with a brief story concerning visiting modern Communistic German in the 1980s, and, with one anecdote, she makes the point that the Communistic German border guards were as repressive, if not more so, than the old Nazi party members. Then, in the next chapter, she jumps to a nostalgic but wonderfully vivid description of Christmas Past, before the War: "Christmas began on the day that Mama melted the butter and honey in an enormous tin pan..." (p. 19). I have to tell my own children that Christmas Eve was once a fast day, with no eating until Midnight Mass, and I sense a kinship of the Past gone by with this writer, even though my Christmases were in NYC and hers in Germany.Her last chapter deals with what the Poles have done to her hometown, her childhood town."My sentimental quest for my hometown is over. I have been walking in the streets of Klodzko, Poland. Glatz has ceased to exist save in my memories." (P. 218). She has written an interesting and complete personal history of living in a few decades in a town in Silesia, decades which saw the rise and fall of many.

"The Forbidden Dairy" by John L. Stewart.Subtitled: "A B-24 Navigator Remembers".McGraw Hill, New York, 1998.During World War II, Allied Airmen were forbidden to keep diaries. The idea was that, if captured, the diary of an Airman would aid the enemy in determining crucial facts about the person, his unit, and theunit's location and organization. The author, John L. Stewart, DID keep a diary of his stint in the 8th Air Force during daylight raids on Festung Europa. Not only did Dr. Stewart keep a diary, but it seems that he took photos of the action over Europe, and, of course, photos of his air base near the town of Norwich, England. Dr. Stewart's photos are interspersed throughout the text of the book, and there are some interesting, vintage views of England. For example, on page 69, there is a nice shot of the Approach to Tower Bridge... is that the Bridge that was moved to Arizona? The author has included period shots of himself, his friends, their Nissen hut quarters and a group of Airmen gathered around a pot belly stove. He has also included photographic evidence of the damage wrought by bombing and in turn, the damage received by the B-24 bombers of his squadron and his group. The visual record provided in this book is a primary source for the history of the bombing campaign from England.John L. Stewart flew in a B-24 named, "Gremlin Manor". Much of the front part of the book is devoted to, his diary, a written record of each and every of the 31 missions that Stewart flew. In retrospect, some of the missions were a "piece of cake", making for somewhat unexciting reading. But then, you will find a period picture of the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River at Remagen. The photo had to be taken after March 17th 1945 (St. Patrick's Day), since the Bridge is collapsed into the river. This is a primary look at history.After the War, Navigator Stewart went on to earn a PhD in Electrical Engineering, Stanford University; he then taught at various universities and colleges. This may account for his need to add Appendix A, some 32 pages explaining "Dead Reckoning", Algebra, Vector Analysis and a collection of photos of some the equipment he used in World War II. As an Electrical Engineer, myself, (Senior Member IEEE), I recall taking Vector Analysis in grad school at Newark College of Engineering. In my humble opinion, this Appendix is not needed, or I would have included a much-reduced Appendix A, just so the reader would get the flavor of the difficulty of navigating an aircraft ... especially when people are popping bullets through your aircraft!Finally, as other Amazon reviewers have complained, there are some spelling errors. I believe the worst is on page 38, where the Norden Bombsight is called "NORDON". The bombsight was named after its inventor, Carl Norden, a Dutchman who emigrated to the United States before World War II. The Norden Bombsight was first produced in New York City.

"Death In Paradise", by Richard B. Parker. Audio version (Five tapes) read by Robert Forester. New Millennium Audio, Beverly Hills, CA.In short, staccato bursts of dialogue, Robert B. Parker tells the story of Chief of Police, Jesse Stone, in the small town of Paradise, north of Boston, Massachusetts. Chief Stone had lost his police job in Los Angeles, lost his first wife and ended up in the small town of Paradise. His experience in Minor League Baseball makes the Chief a star in the local softball league, and that's where the story begins. The softball team's reverie after the early evening game is broken by the discovery of badly decomposed body floating in the lake. The story then grows around Chief Stone's development of his tiny police force by instructing them, with on-the-job training, in big city police tactics.The dead girl's family has disowned her; the girl had run away, and become part of a sex for pay group. Stone shows his police officers how to act on routine (and boring) stakeouts and finally, he tracks down the murderer. Throughout all of this, the author has interspersed tales of Stone's alcoholism, failure at married life and regrets with the injury that cost him a promising baseball career. About three-quarters of the way through, you begin suspecting the identity of the killer, but these side issues in the life of Chief Stone continue to make the book interesting.This book appears to be better if it is read aloud. The audio version, read by Robert Forester, flowed naturally and rapidly. Everything seemed to fit together as the book was read. It certainly helped me in the traffic of I-495, around Boston. Speaking of Boston, please let the reader know that the pronunciation of Copely Square is "COP-lee", not the "Cope -lee" used in this presentation.

"Battlefire! Combat Stories From World War II" by Col. Arthur L. KellyThe University of Kentucky Press, 1997.This book is written by a veteran of three wars: World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Colonel Kelly has collected in one place eleven (11) different stories of World War II, ranging, chronologically, from the Japanese sneak attack on the Navy at Pearl Harbor to the Marines' attack on Iwo Jima. The author recounts experiences of individuals in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Army Air Corps and the Marine Corps. Interestingly, all of the eleven individuals were from Kentucky. This is understandable for a book from "The University Press of Kentucky".I found it difficult to read the story of Corporal Field Reed Jr. who was on the Bataan Death March and was a POW at Camp Cabanatuan, where he was rescued by U. S. Army Rangers.Of personal interest to me was the story of Signalman First Class Lee Ebner, U. S. Navy. He was on the USS West Virginia, BB48, which was sunk at Pearl Harbor. Ebner recounts how he joined thousands of sailors who had lost their home due to the attack. There were seven (7) active battleships at Pearl Harbor on that December day. If each ship had a crew of 1500 men, then there were some 10,500 sailors who lost their belongings, their uniforms, and their place to sleep at night. On the USS Arizona, BB39, more than a thousand sailors also lost their lives. Signalman Ebner relates that he was assigned to a destroyer, the USS Mahan, DDG37, the day after the raid on Pearl Harbor. What a let down! From a big battleship to a tin can! Ebner's story goes all the way to the end of the war, where he was under attack by Kamikazes.Here is a story yet to be fully told. How did the Navy deal with thousands of displaced sailors on the days and weeks after the sneak attack? Where did they go to eat? To sleep? Where did they obtain new uniforms, and how did they get paid? The old Navy always wanted full and complete pay records before they would give you a dime.This slim volume covers the full gamut of World War II experiences, from the raid on Pearl Harbor, to POW stories, to B17 raids and depth charge attacks on American submarines. Nicely done!

"Waterloo: A Near Run Thing" by David Howarth.Phoenix Paperback, London, Orion Books Ltd, 1968 and paperback in 2003.In a large chain bookstore, I noticed this paperback in the "History" section near the World War II offerings; the book made me recall my European History professor who stated that most of us would remember Waterloo as the "Big Battle", in France, early 19th Century, which ended the comeback of Emperor Napoleon. Of course, using the common mistake as a lead-in, the professor said that the Battle of Waterloo was in Belgium, not France, and then wandered off on how Belgium had suffered through so many big battles, including the Battle of the Bulge, 1944. So, from a sense of duty, despite the original 1968 copyright date, I purchased this book and I was not disappointed. Exceptional writing.David Howarth, (1912-1991), was an excellent writer of History. In "Waterloo", Howarth has drawn upon sources (almost two centuries' old), and fashioned the comments of the ordinary British soldiers and officers into a fresh and life-like accounting of the day, 18 June 1815.It was as if you were standing alongside the soldier in the British square awaiting the charge of the French cavalry. The author has made the events of that June 1815 sparkling new on the paperback pages. In my humble opinion, you should be aware that the author favors the British point of view. Of course, the title, "A Near Run Thing" is a British idiom, indicating that point of view. The author raises the question of Napoleon's supposed illness on that fateful day; what was wrong with him? However, I am still looking for a book which gives better or full credit to the Prussian Field Marshall Bloucher (I still do not know how to get the Amazon word processor to put in umlauts), and his Prussian soldiers in their black uniforms with white facings. In any event, Waterloo WAS a great victory for the allies, ending the ambitions of Napoleon, and freeing Europe from the dominance of France. The Duke of Wellington played a key role in the triumph, but if the Prussians had not arrived when they had....Don't let the copyright date of almost 40 years ago throw you off; this book is worth the purchase price.

"Pearl Harbor Ghosts", by Thurston Clarke, sub-titled: "The Legacy Of December 7, 1941." Ballantine Books, New York, 1999 & 2001.The extensive research by the author, Thurston Clarke, is marred, in my opinion, by a tendency towards sensationalism. Clarke's agenda is not really clear, but when a choice can be made, his writing tended towards the more popular and more sensational. For example, on page 22, Clarke writes that the Japanese spy, Ensign Yoshikawa, was not on either list of suspects to be detained in case of war. The implication, of course, being that the FBI and military intelligence were sort of incompetent in pre-war Hawaii. A very casual check on my part found in John Toland's book, " Infamy. Pearl Harbor And Its Aftermath", that secret agent Takeo Yoshikawa was burning code books during the Pearl Harbor attack, but within ten minutes of the bombs beginning to fall, "...someone shouted, `Open the door!' The door caved in and Lieutant Yoshio Hasegawa of the Honolulu police burst in with several men. They began stamping on the smoldering code books". It would seem that Yoshikawa was on someone's list, and to imply otherwise is tending towards sensationalism.On pages 133-134, the author, T. Clarke, presents a case for calling the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the A-bomb drop on Hiroshima as "sneak attacks". The sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is obvious, but making the use of a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima "sneaky" is illogical and sensational.Clarke let his book follow the popular movie plots, so that he tells you, on page 192, that the name of the black mess attendant (recall the movie) on the "West Virginia" was Doris Miller and that he earned the Navy Cross. For some reason, however, he does not mention that fifteen (15) Medals of Honor were awarded for the action at Pearl Harbor. For example, when the "Oklahoma" turned turtle and capsized, Ensign Francis Flaherty pushed the last sailor out of the turret, thereby trapping himself in the sinking battle ship. I wonder if Clarke missed a grand opportunity to develop more "ghosts" by interviewing the sailors who had been saved by this officer's bravery. What did those men accomplish in the remainder of the war? Did they survive? Where are they now?Take a look at the picture of the USS Arizona's band at Bloch Arena (following page 204). On page 84, Mr. Clarke comments and sees them as ghosts already, "...sitting ... in dress whites and already a ghostly presence". Unfortunately for Mr. Clarke's comments, in the late 1930s, the U. S. Navy did away with "dress white" uniforms for enlisted men. The picture in his book clearly shows the Arizona's band in undress whites with neckerchiefs.Finally, the group that called the Opana Radar Site as an "electrical engineering milestone" (page 99) was NOT the Institute of Electrical Engineers, which is British, but rather was the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), an American organization, which at 300,000 member engineers is usually considered the world's largest professional group.Sincerely, John Peter Rooney, Senior Member IEEE.

"The Way To Bright Star" by Dee Brown. Recorded Books, Inc.1998.The noted author and Historian of the West, Dee Alexander Brown, has branched out into fiction with this lengthy tale of delivering two camels from Missouri to Bright Star, Indiana. There are really two plot lines in this engaging novel. The first is the telling of the actual driving of the camels from war-torn (Civil War) Missouri to Indiana. It seems that Union Captain Solomon Lightfoot has dreams of a farming empire where camels would replace the horse and the ox. The good Captain "enlists" the services of Johnny Hawkes, young Ben Butterfield and a girl with the name of Jack Bonnycastle. With the aid of the Egyptian camel driver, Hadjee, this little group starts out towards Indiana. Their adventure allows Dee Brown to elicit the mannerisms, language and the simpler culture of a time long ago. This is told in the third person.The second plot line, in the first person, presents the reminiscences of an older Ben Butterfield. It has to be some forty years later, since the characters discuss the assassination of William McKinley (1843-1901) and wonder if Pres. Roosevelt will be able to handle the office. (That's Teddy Roosevelt!) As the older Ben Butterfield remembers and relates, Dee Brown paints a picture of turn-of-the-century America, a simpler time when the telephone was becoming a jangling nuisance and rowing down a local river was considered a wonderful outing for the more adventurous in the town.The novel comes to a nostalgic conclusion as the elder Ben Butterfield approaches his old circus that has come to town. He hopes to see his old friend, Jack Bonnycastle, who was really a girl, by the name of "Queen Elizabeth Jones". It seems that this girl had developed into a noted equestrian, who performed before the crowned heads of Europe. Due to a broken leg, Ben had been left behind as Queen Elizabeth and the circus had gone on to fame and glory. Ben Butterfield had always loved Queen Elizabeth Jones. The ending is rather sad but touching.Tom Stechschulte does an excellent job in reading this book, nine full cassettes. The reader gives an unique and appropriate to the many different characters, ranging from wounded Southern soldiers to Hadjee, who has a little English and a little French. Well done. This presentation helped me to endure Boston Traffic.

"Struggle For Survival" by R.A.C. Parker, Sub-titled, " The History Of the Second World War". Oxford University Press, 1990.This is a small book (only 328 pages) and is therefore easy to handle. But, even though small, Parker's book covers all the important subjects of the Second World War. The chapters are arranged more or less chronologically, ranging from Chamberlain's pre-war "appeasement" to a final assessment chapter entitled, "Casualties, Crisis and Change". Although the author is a Fellow of Modern History at Queen's College, Oxford, he states , up front, that he has "... tried to escape any British prejudices in considering the conduct of the allies". (Page v.) In my opinion, Parker has done a pretty good job of stating the facts and NOT taking British, American, French , German, etc. side in any argument. He has included a chapter on strategic bombing, and, interesting, it appears that he believes strategic bombing did NOT work in German occupied Europe, but that bombing did work against the Empire of Japan. Chapter 14 deals with the defeat of Japan and the use of the atomic bomb. Chapter 17 deals with the "Murder of European Jews" and the theme of unnecessary and unrequited killing is finished in Chapter 18, "Casualties, Crisis and Change".I used this book as quick but complete reference in a World War II course I was taking at Bridgewater State College, when I was working on my MA in History.

"Heirs Of The Fisherman" by John-Peter Pham, subtitled, "Behind The Scenes Of Papal Death And Succession" . Oxford University Press, 2004.This is an excellent reference book for anyone interested in the history of the papacy, the present method of electing a pope and the possible candidates for the job when the present Pope, John Paul II, dies. The author addresses the almost two thousand years' history of the papacy, the methods once employed in choosing a pope and the development of the current conclave approach. Be aware that this takes some 174 pages of text written by John-Peter Pham, and then, from page 175 up to page 318, there are some seven (7) appendices. The Appendices make this a great reference book.Appendix 1 is a listing of all the popes, which brings up a touchy issue for the author, John-Peter Pham. According to his reckoning, there have only been 261 popes, and I want to underline the word, "popes". As John-Peter Pham points out there have been 263 pontificates, but, since Benedict XI served on three separate occasions, there have been only 261 persons. Counting separately all three terms of Benedict XI results in 263 popes. So, this is similar to counting Grover Cleveland as two separate presidents, even though he was only one person, because he served two separate and distinct presidential terms: 1885-1889 and 1893-1897. (Take a look at the notes, page 319 for a better explanation.) In Appendix 3, the author presents a list of "Cardinals Presently Eligible To Vote In A Conclave", (from page 213 to 289). By inference, the next pope will probably be chosen from these men. This is already outdated as Belgium's Jan Pieter Cardinal Schotte died on January 10, 2005. Then, the last wills and testaments of popes John XXIII and Paul VI are in Appendix 6 and Appendix 7, respectively. It is really not clear to me why the author included such legal documents. Perhaps he wants to provide precedents for future popes?If you want a one-volume, concise reference for the history and election of the popes, this is it.

"Breakout" by Martin Russ. Sub-titled: "The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea, 1950"Almost a first person "I was there" Marine account of the surrounding of the United States Marines by the Chinese Communist Army at the Chosin Reservoir, at the border between North Korea and the People's Republic of China, in 1950. Martin Russ has written this book almost exclusively from the point of view of the ground-pounding Marine, with the general officers rarely mentioned. When Mr. Russ does mention high-ranking individuals, such as General Douglas MacArthur, it is to point out, scornfully, their mistakes and lack of leadership. Interestingly, Russ does not emphasize the role of Marine General Chesty Puller in this campaign.This review is called "Semper Fi" as Mr. Martin sees almost everything from the USMC perspective, with a major exception (perhaps) being the U.S. Navy Medical Corpsmen who accompanied the Marines. Was the U.S. Army that bad?, "Thus, one U.S. Army unit abandoned another U.S. Army unit" p. 262. A more balanced presentation is called for, as, for example, in the efforts of Naval Air , who supported the Marines on the ground as much as Marine Air.Overall, despite the defendable bias for the Marines, the horror and the "you are there" recounting of the swarming of the Chinese soldiers into death by guns of the Marines makes this vivid description of the Chosin campaign well worth reading.

"Encyclopedia Of The Irish In America", Edited by Michael Glazier. University of Notre Dame Press, 1999.At almost a thousand pages, this is a big book, listing, alphabetically, many, many Irish Americans, from the very famous to those know only to historical specialists. Further, there are subject sections that are very interesting. For example, from pages 275 to 292, the section, entitled, "Ethnic Relations", gives a concise summary of the history of how the Irish in America dealt with the Blacks, Germans, Italians, Jews and Poles. There is also a state by state examination of the history of the Irish immigrants; some sections are only a few pages (e.g.. Montana), while other state sections (New York, New Jersey) are necessarily larger. If you are interested in which state had the greatest collection of Irish-born, take a look at the table on pages 461-462.You could spend many a night going alphabetically through this excellent reference, and you will be surprised with the achievements of the Irish-Americans, ranging from their many different occupations to the many awards the Irish-Americans have garnered. Page 635: Audie Murphy, most decorated soldier in World War II. Page 369: Andrew Greeley, priest, sociologist and novelist (his books are listed on Amazon). Page 601: Thomas Francis Meagher, Civil War General and editor. If you wanted to know more about the Irish in America, this book is a good place to start.

"The Rise And Fall Of The Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy. Random House, New York, 1987.It was 1987, twenty years ago, when this book was first published. I used this book when I was working on my MA in History. The central thesis of Kennedy's book is portrayed explicitly by the book's dust jacket. On that dust jacket, the United Kingdom, represented by John Bull, carrying a Union Jack, is stepping down from the "top of the world", and he is looking back at those who are following. Uncle Sam, carrying the Stars and Stripes, is just about to step down, following John Bull. Directly behind Uncle Sam is a thin, bespectacled fellow in a three piece suit. Since this fellow is carrying the Rising Sun, it is obvious that Mr. Kennedy is proposing the heir-apparent, Japan, for world-dominance.World events have overtaken Kennedy's book, and these events include, just to mention a few: Einheit Day, the day of unification of Germany, October 3 1990, the demise of communism in Europe and the splintering of the Soviet Union. We have had not one, but two wars in Iraq, and NATO troops are controlling Afghanistan. Today, former members of the communistic empire are clamoring to join the European Union. It has been fifty years since the Treaty of Rome (1957) which is generally recognized as the inception of the European Union. Europe has become the crucible of political and economic change, and is therefore challenging the United States and the economically quiescent Japan for leadership of the world. It is time to revise the "Rise And Fall", and the author should be careful to consider the building of submarine fleets, not only by China, but also by Iran.

"The Deadwood Beetle" by Mylene Dressler, G. K. Hall & Co., 2001, Large Type Book.At first, this book appears to be about a little Dutch boy who survived the Holocaust, and, years later spies his mother's sewing table in an antiques store. The store owner, Cora Lowenstein, translates the child's inscription, on the bottom of the table, without knowing that it was Tristan Martens, himself, who carved it there years ago. Her version in English is "When the Jews are gone, we will be the next ones", which she interprets as in the same fashion as the famous quote from Pastor Niemoeller, (1892-1984).It seems, however, that was not the meaning of the carved words: Tristan Martens (who now had to be in his late sixties or early seventies) knew it was from his Dutch father, who was a Nazi. Tristan was not a victim of the holocaust; instead, his family was waiting for their turn in power, after the Jews were gone. Angry Dutch citizens had looted his mother's table from their Dutch home when The Netherlands was liberated. He feels guilty for most of his life. This central theme of guilt is always a background plot as Tristan begins to see Cora Lowenstein in a romantic light. The guilt theme is intertwined, somewhat, with entomology, as he deals with his last graduate student, who, in turn, is dealing with a unique form of insect out in Arizona. Tristan Martens tells the student's parents how he happened to be an immigrant (as they were) and some of the story of his life directly after the World War.Except for flashbacks to his life in The Netherlands, the book is set mainly in winter-time New York City, with some trips to a nursing home in nearby Connecticut. I think that the author, Dressler, has done a good job in capturing the flavor of subways and travel in New York. She has written an intriguing book.

"The Real Enemy" by Pierre D'Harcourt.Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1967.According to Wikipedia, D'Harcourt is "... one of the most ancient French noble families and one of the oldest dynasties in Europe." The author, Pierre D'Harcourt, begins his story by stating that his family had produced marshals, admirals, academicians, ... scholars and ambassadors." On a warm day in June 1940, Pierre D'Harcourt was with his "famous cavalry regiment" near Calais, just before Dunkirk fell. His little battle lasted "... about two days" and they decided to surrender. He walked home.After a while, he became involved with the French Resistance, helping British soldiers to escape, and so on. But, on one ill-fated day, he was arrested. As he attempted to escape, he was hit with three bullets, the third "... hit my leg slightly above the knee and broke it". All of this takes place in the first 22 pages of the book. The book has 186 pages.In the remainder of the book, the author tells the story of his imprisonment,ranging from the hospital in which he was treated, to solitary confinement in Fresnes prison, to the reprisal camp called Neue Bremm, to the infamous concentration camp, Buchenwald. He tells the personal story of his mood swings, up and down. Surely, the Nazis would not fix him up just to execute him. Surely, Neue Bremm would be better than the years of solitary confinement. Surely, there would be more rations at the next camp, and so on.Throughout his imprisonment, D'Harcourt relied upon his Roman Catholic faith, even though his "...religion, with its emphasis on sin and the catastrophe of death and the prospect of judgement in another world, has ...sapped my vitality". (Page 28).Unlike many other personal memoirs of Nazi concentration camps, D'Harcourt relates how the different prisoner groups vied for authority and control. For the last two years, or so, D'Harcourt was being watch closely by the camp Communists who were afraid of him, due to (a) his aristocratic background and (b) his Roman Catholicism. Being a prisoner made D'Harcourt a target of every insane S. S. guard who sadistically enjoyed beating anyone, near-by, who happened to be walking by. Being a Roman Catholic, however, made him a target of the power plays and plots of the Communists who wanted to control the camp, the assignments to soft jobs and death-dealing tasks. All of this took place while the Nazi guards adopted a lassiez faire attitude towards the internal working of the camp. The details of the power struggle presented by Pierre D'Harcourt are rarely repeated in other chronicles of the camps, making this book, "The Real Enemy", tend towards uniqueness.

"The Pumpkin Patch" by Margaret McNamara. Illustrated by Mike Gordon.Aladdin Paperbacks, Simon & Schuster, New York, 2003This is a "Ready To Read" book that begins with Mrs. Connor bringing her first grade class to the "Pumpkin Patch" to pick out a pumpkin for Halloween, and Katie wanted to find the perfect pumpkin. All throughout the long bus ride (on a standard yellow school bus), Katie dreamed about the "perfect pumpkin". BUT! When she finally chose a pumpkin, Katie's ideal pumpkin did not meet the expectations of all the other kids, Emma and Ayanna and Neil and James. Not round! Not big! Not tall! Too, too small! Katie realized that her pumpkin was too small.When Katie tells her father that she had picked a "... bad pumpkin", Dad knows just what to do. What they do together is the central theme of the entire book, and I will not tell you here how the father solves the dilemma. This is an excellent Halloween book, especially for individuals who are concerned that Halloween is really an ancient pagan Celtic feast. By the way, one of the reasons that we purchased this book for our granddaughter, Tabitha, is that my wife, a widow, was Mrs. Connor, a school teacher, before she married me, a widower.

"Hostile Waters", by Peter Huchthausen, Igor Kurdin and R. Alan White. Thorndike Press, Thorndike, Maine, Large type edition, 1997.An excellent book, dealing with the loss of the K-219, a Soviet Nuclear submarine, off the east coast of the United States. This book is non-fiction but it reads like a fast moving, modern day thrill novel, thanks, probably, to the efforts of author R. Alan White. The book also reads like a "you are there!" recitation of the events of the sinking, undoubtedly due to the efforts of Igor Kurdin, of the Russian Navy. Finally, there are some pointed comments about higher-level actions and reactions, probably due to the efforts of Captain Peter Huchthausen, USN, Retired. It is impressive that three different writers from such disparate backgrounds could produce a book that is such a well-written story of the events in the sinking of the K-219. It all comes together in such an interesting fashion that it was difficult to put the book down.As we watch the world react to the aftermath of September 11 2001, we wonder why the CIA and the FBI did not have better communications with each other agency. The provincialism and secrecy of the USN submarine service is well documented in this book. In some ways, this is a theme of this book; rivalry between service branches and within each service hinders cooperation and communications. On page 225, for example, you can find: the U.S. Navy's "... number one enemy: the United Sates Air Force". Personally, I can recall working as reliability engineer on a small Navy project in 1987, and I referenced an Air Force document as substantiation for my calculations. I was told, "Wrong color blue". Navy Blue versus Air Force blue.

"Good King Wenceslas" Illustrated by Christopher MansonNorth-South Books.The Illustrator, Christopher Manson, has gone through a great deal of work to produce a beautiful book of art telling the story of "Good King Wenceslas", as well known by the carol of the same name, written by John Mason Neale in 1853.The colorful illustrations match the Christmas season, with the front piece and the back piece both being intertwined holly. The book presents the entire carol. Each stanza of the carol faces an illustration portraying the action in the song: for example, at the beginning, the good King is actually looking out a window, with the wind obviously ruffling the pages of a book on a chair. King Wenceslas is presented as young man, with a concerned look on his face as he sees the tattered peasant "...gathering winter fuel." As the Page and the King carry food and pine logs to the peasant's dwelling, the winter cold grows harsher. The King tells the Page to walk in his foot steps, and the Page finds warmth in each foot print. I have always thought of this as an echo of Christ telling St. Peter to leave the boat and walk across the water to Him.I look forward to my granddaughter, Katlain, using the music at the back of the book to play this carol at Christmas time, while my daughter, her aunt, supports her on the piano. Excellent book! That can become a family heirloom.

"The Christmas Story", Text selected by Linn Howard and Mary Jane Pool, with Photographs by Elliott Erwitt. Harry N. Abrams, Publishers, New York, 2001.This is an elegantly bound book, with spectacular photos of the 18th century crib created by the leading artists of the then Kingdom of Naples. This small book will make an excellent stocking stuffer. The Photographer, Elliot Erwitt, has done a wonderful job of catching all the miniature details of the multitude of figurines used in the crib (or cr&egrave;che, as the book calls it).Although you are told that the figures are "...no more than twenty inches high", it is not until you reach the last photo of the book, displaying the cr&egrave;che on a table top, that you fully realize how small the entire scene is. Then, you begin to get an inkling of the amount of work the photographer has done to capture the exquisite beauty of each tiny piece.For me, the overall book is marred by the choice of Gospel texts from the King James Version. For members of the largest Christian church in the United States, the King James Version is not acceptable. Further, the King James Version has blatant errors, such as (see page 19 in this tiny book), Luke 2.13,14, which reads, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men". Various Protestant bible societies have come around to, ".. peace on earth to those on whom his favor rests" This is close enough to the Douay-Rheims, "...peace on earth to men of good will". So, five stars for the excellent photography, one star for the choice of bible version, yields an average of three stars.

"Magpie Magic" by April Wilson, sub-titled, "A Tale Of Colorful Mischief", Dial Books, New York, 1999.The words in this book stop with the copyright page. Then, the entire story is told in colorful illustrations by April Wilson. The magpie, a black and white bird, first is drawn, and, with a backward glance, flies off the paper. The illustrator's hands attempt to catch the wayward bird, who soon returns to eat the luscious, red cherries that also pop up off the paper. The orange balloon is soon popped, too, but then the magpie helps the hands to draw with the yellow pencil. The story continues through the colors of the rainbow, green and then blue, and finally, to a purple (violet) cage into which the magpie is lured with more bright red cherries. A brown lock is drawn to secure the cage and the brown key is erased.But! The magpie has seen how the gum eraser works, and uses it to escape from the cage. The bird then creates mayhem until the illustrator erases most of magpie with the white gum eraser. The magpie struggles to re-constitute itself , and does so using every color of the rainbow. A most colorful story, indeed!

"The Tall Book Of Christmas" Selected by Dorothy Hall Smith.Harper & Row, New York, 1954.I was cleaning out the basement and found a beat-up copy of "The Tall Book Of Christmas". I remembered my oldest daughter reading this book at Christmas time and getting to the very last story, "The Night Before Christmas" but saving that story for Christmas Eve. My daughter is now forty years old. I thought that I would purchase a new copy of this pretty book for her daughter, Tabitha, and so, I went on Amazon.Amazon says that a new version of "The Tall Book Of Christmas" will be published in October 2006. The new table of contents listed on Amazon is just about the same as the old book I had. Christmas carols are interspersed among Christmas stories making an agreeable change of reading pace, especially if you can convince the children to sing along. The first story is a synthesis of the birth of Christ according to St. Luke and St. Matthew; this is exceedingly fitting. Illustrations are both color and black and white.I highly recommend getting the book for your children.

"Sea Of Sharks" by Elmer Renner and Ken Birks. Subtitled: "A Sailor's World War II Survival Story". Naval Institute Press, 2004.Many years after the events, these two gentlemen got together to write the ever so brief history of the World War II minesweeper, YMS-472. This was a tiny vessel, constructed of wood, so as to avoid setting off magnetic mines. The beginning chapters deal with the commission of the ship, the accidents during practice and drill, and the routine efforts of the YMS-472 operating out of Governor's Island, in the harbor of New York City. As the war wound down, a group of minesweepers were ordered from the East Coast to the Pacific theatre. Mr. Renner's description of the voyage to the Pacific is an excellent sea story in itself. The crew had been concerned with the fact that the vessel's number, 472, added up to 13 ... which sailors considered unlucky,. Then, their date of arrival was scheduled as the 13th. Renner brings up many of the superstitions of the crew ..."hard luck ship", and the need for him, as an officer, to deal with such personnel problems (see Chapter Two, entitled appropriately , "Thirteens", pp. 29-51). There is a lot of old Navy in this section.From Chapter Three ("Typhoon"), to the end of the book, Renner deals with the so-called "Makurazaki Typhoon", September 1945, the destruction it wrought, and the capsizing of the tiny YMS-472. Renner's description of actual shuddering and capsizing of the vessel is extremely frightening. The last few chapters deal the survivors' days in a very small raft, their attempts to swim to an island (with one sailor being eaten by a shark), the lack of search and rescue by the U.S. Navy, and their rescue, apparently by a chance sighting.Renner indicts the U.S. Navy for either a sin of omission, if the Navy staff at Okinawa did know that the YMS-472 was missing at sea, or for a sin of commission, if the same Navy staff did not even make an effort to find the YMS-472 and her survivors. Twenty five men went down with the ship. RIP.

"Marauder" By Lois S. Rehr, with Carleton R. Rehr. Subtitled: "Memoir Of A B-26 Pilot In Europe In World War II." McFarland & Company, Jefferson, N. C. 2004.The mains portion of this book deals with the author's adventures as a pilot flying the Martin B-26 Marauder, a twin engine bomber, in World War II. The book jumps right into the action, beginning with the D-Day, June 6 1994 invasion of Festung Europa. The author then traces the action from newly liberated France to the attacks on the heart of Germany. Chapter 11, "The Last Of The Jet Boys", is one of the more extensive accounts of the USAAF struggles with the German ME-262 jet fighter that I have read. Almost all, if not all, of the American aircraft were outclassed by the ME-262 jet. I found the author's stories about flying sorties to be gripping, but there are better flying accounts, as in "Wreaking Havoc: A Year In An A-20" by Joseph W. Rutter. The A-20 was also a twin engine bomber.The last chapter, "Disarmament Duty" is interesting in its own right. The author describes the low-key but ever present hostility of the conquered Germans. When the Americans requisitioned their house for living quarters, some German ladies stuffed up the toilets with towels. Louis S. Rehr, the author, had visited Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. He had photographed various monuments, such as the "Feldherrnhalle" in Munich (1938). On page 181, the photo shows the author in the same spot in 1945. He also took a picture of the famous (infamous) Munich Hofbrauhaus being occupied by the American 157th Infantry Regiment. This chapter, alone, is worth reading the book for.

"What We Knew" by Eric A. Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband.Subtitled: "Terror, Mass Murder, and Every Day Life In Nazi Germany".Basic Books, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2005.This book was written by a team of authors, one, an American historian and the other, a German sociologist. The excellent team of writers has compiled a lengthy book (434 pages) that attempts to determine what, if anything, the ordinary German knew about the extermination of so many people, including more than six million Jews, by the Nazi regime which held power from 1933 to 1945. The authors have applied the techniques of modern statistical analysis, interviewing a large sample of individuals who lived through the terror, in an attempt to extrapolate their opinions, into an estimation of the actual feelings and actual knowledge of the actual participants, Jew and Gentile. I emphasize the word, "actual". I congratulate the authors on their efforts. I would be frightened to attempt the same thing.The greater portion of the book (some 253 pages) accumulates selected interviews with both Jews and Gentiles. Pages 3 to 135 deal with interviews of the Jewish participants while pages 141 to 259 deal with the testimonies of the "ordinary Germans". These interviews represent a "primary source" as Historians define them. By their very nature, however, these interviews do not lend themselves to a flowing, comprehensive story. This makes it difficult to read. The interviews do present a statistical sample of how the people felt about the terror and what they knew about the camps.In the next few chapters, called "Part THREE", pages 263-399, the authors analyze the data. This section of the book is a good "Secondary source", as defined by Historians. There are tables summarizing a wealth of information, such as the "Level of the Knowledge of Mass Murders of Jews among Jewish Survivors", broken down by the country to which the survivor escaped. Interestingly, on page 313, Table 10-3 shows that the main "Source of Knowledge" of the Mass Murders of Jews was radio broadcasts!Technology affecting History. One wonders what television would have done. I served in the United States Navy in the segregated South during the late 1950s. Back home, in Manhattan, my tales of water fountains for "Colored" and "Whites" were looked upon as sea stories from a distant country. It took television reports of incidents such as Selma, Alabama, to make the nation conscious of the meanness of segregation. Who knows what a future statistician might make of our nastiness in segregation and what the ordinary citizen, living in The Bronx, knew about the evils of segregation?The final conclusion of the authors is that "...a dictatorship can enjoy widespread popularity among the majority even while committing unspeakable crimes against minorities and others". (Page 398).

"Once There Was A Christmas Tree", by Jerry Smath, Cartwheel Books, 2005.This book, in my humble opinion, is based upon the old adage, "It is more blessed to give than to receive".Christmas is coming and Mrs. Bear asks Mr. Bear to get a Christmas tree. Being a bear, of course, he cuts down a tree that is too big for the house, and the illustration shows the tip of tree bending down from the ceiling. The solution to this problem is to cut the tree in half and give one half to Mr. Fox. Of course, Mr. Fox finds he only needs half of that half of a tree, and the fox gives half a tree to Mr. Rabbit. Mr. Rabbit is home alone, a situation familiar to many of us who are retired. Mr. Rabbit is happy to get the tree, and, whilst decorating the tree, the rabbit discovers a family of mice living under the floor boards. In the end , each animal family, (all nicely illustrated) has a wonderful Christmas, especially Mr. Rabbit, who has discovered he is not alone!The book has a transparent plastic cover, through which you can see and maneuver a shiny gel, which is filled with red, green and other colored tiny balls. If you work at it, you can "decorate" the green tree with the gel and those ornaments, and Mr. Bear is standing there, ready to cap your efforts with a golden star.Wonderful!
