Devastated after the tragic death of her husband, Jennifer has buried herself in working as a columnist for the Chicago Tribune. But when her beloved Grandmother, Samantha, has a bad fall and is in a coma, Jennifer drops everything to travel to Lake Geneva, an hour and a half away. Jennifer spent many wonderful summers at Lake Geneva as a child and despite the circumstances she's happy to be in one of her favorite places. While at the cottage, Jennifer discovers her grandmother has left her a packet of letters that will reveal some secrets from her grandmother's past. As Jennifer is slowly finding out the secrets about her grandparents, she is also discovering her feelings for Brendan, who is also staying at Lake Geneva. But Brendan has a secret of his own, a secret that threatens to keep him and Jennifer apart forever."Sam's Letters to Jennifer" is what I call a perfect beach book. It's not too deep, has a touch of tragedy, yet it's a good love story (two love stories actually) and doesn't require a lot of thought. None of the characters are particularly deep - Jennifer is supposed to be a workaholic but outside of one column, we never see her working and she soon ditches her job without a qualm. Same with Brendan, while he had a compelling reason to quit his job, neither he nor Jennifer seems to worry about money. Since we mostly see Sam through her letters, it's hard to sympathize with her as a character and her romance left me a bit cold. However, Jennifer and Brendan's love story was much more engaging. There are some plot holes; I was never quite sure if Jennifer's father was dead or alive, her mother is mentioned but he never is. Brendan's secret is a bit too melodramatic and the outcome a bit unbelievable, but sweet. But again, this isn't the kind of book you want to think too much about, instead just read and enjoy."Sam's Letters to Jennifer" is a light, fluffy read - perfect for the beach or a rainy afternoon.

Set during the Civil War, "Little Women" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a "young lady". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of "Little Women" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything."Little Women" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read "Little Women", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. "Little Women" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little "sermons" to her readers."Little Women" is a delightful book for readers young and old.

When Frank and Lillian Gilbreth married, he said he wanted to have an even dozen children and Lillian was happy to oblige, having six boys and six girls. Frank and Lillian worked as efficiency experts and Frank employed efficiency techniques at home including figuring out how to shave in the quickest amount of time; how to dress as quickly as possible; having everyone in the family get their tonsils removed at the same time; and holding an Assembly Call in which he whistled and timed how long it took the family to gather together. Frank was the disciplinarian while Lillian was willing to look the other way when the children acted up. Together they had all kinds of adventures, some on land, some at sea, many of them hilarious.Written by Frank Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey about their childhood, "Cheaper by the Dozen" is a very funny, old-fashioned read. The father stands out among all the characters, with his strict ideas about discipline and efficiency, yet having a nice sense of humor. Some of his ideas were a bit much, like having his children skip grades to get through school faster. While Frank is larger than life (literally), his wife Lillian is a more quiet character, seemingly in the background until you realize how much control she has over her husband. With twelve children, it's hard to keep them all straight, but a few of them stand out. Bill stands out most notably, with his penchant for playing practical jokes. He has some of the funniest moments in the book - like when he turns the table on his father who liked to scare them with his car horn; almost knocking the cook in the oven; or terrorizing his Aunt Anne. The other children who stand out are oldest daughters Anne and Ernestine who have the unenviable task of dealing with their father as they start to date. The book is more stream of consciousness than chronological and it can be hard to keep track of how old the children are. The book is full of humorous events including family trips in the car which always caused people to stare; family council meetings; a visit from a woman representing birth control who had no idea how large the family was; boat trips; and a visit from a psychologist. The book also has brief biographical sketches of both Frank and Lillian, although Frank's service during World War One is barely touched on. Although the book is humorous, it still touches on the difficulties of raising a large family, notably when Lillian had to travel by train from Boston to California with seven children who were sick for much of the trip. Some parts of the book made me cringe, especially when Martha had her tonsils removed after eating a heavy meal and when Lillian, tired of waiting at the hospital for her baby to be born, walked home while in labor. Still, most of the book was very funny."Cheaper by the Dozen" is a nice, humorous read.

Eight year old Rhoda Penmark seems like the perfect child, pretty, smart and charming. But watch out. If she doesn't get what she wants, knowing her could kill you!This film is a great thriller with plenty of chilling moments. The cast is excellent, especially young Patty McCormack as Rhoda. Eileen Heckart is also a stand out in a small, but heartbreaking role as the mother of a child murdered by Rhoda. Henry Jones is appropriately creepy as Leroy, the janitor in Rhoda's apartment building, who teases Rhoda one time too much. Nancy Kelly overacts a bit as Christine, Rhoda's mother, but in some scenes she is brilliant, particularly in one scene where she struggles to compose herself in a room full of people.Despite the theme, this isn't a violent film. All of the killings take place off camera, although viewers do hear one character die off screen. The ending of the film was made to conform with standards at the time it was made, which, while not as chilling as the ending of the book, is part of the charm of the film.The DVD extras include the original trailer, an audio commentary, and a conversation with Patty McCormack.This is a good film for people that like to be scared but not inundated with violence. Make sure you watch this film and not the tepid remake.

Raised by a religious fanatic mother, Carrie White had been teased and tormented by her classmates for years. She tried to fit in, quietly rebelling against her mother when she could, but her classmates are unforgiving. Things get worse when Carrie gets her period for the very first time at age 17, and not knowing what is going on, thinks she is bleeding to death. Carrie is dealing with the humiliation of that incident, plus the discovery that she has the ability to make things move simply by looking at them, when Tommy Ross asks her to the Senior Prom. Carrie begins to think that she might finally fit in with her classmates, unaware that two of them are planning on playing a nasty prank at the Prom. Little do they realized that that prank would unleash Carrie's powers causing destruction her town may never recover from.Written over 30 years ago, Stephen King's first novel still has the power to scare readers. He captures the high school years perfectly and anyone who wasn't part of the "in" crowd (and perhaps those that were) will emphasize with Carrie. King has said that he didn't particularly care for the character Carrie, but I found her to be a sympathetic character. King, in fact, makes her especially sympathetic when describing her home life with her nutcase of a mother and her inner thoughts and feelings. Sue Snell and Tommy Ross are likable characters, if a bit unbelievable (King tries hard to make it work, but Sue's reasons for having Tommy invite Carrie to the prom, and Tommy's acceptance of those reasons never quite ring true). Chris Hargenson and Billy Nolan are nasty villains and deserve what happens to them.King uses an interesting technique in this novel. "Carrie" book is divided into three parts: Blood Sport, Prom Night, and Wreckage. Blood Sport is an apt title as there are images of blood throughout the book; even Carrie's prom dress is red. There are no chapters, instead King intersperses fictional newspaper and magazine articles, fictional excerpts from books written about Carrie, letters, and interviews with survivors and others who knew Carrie along with the action as it unfolds. King is not a subtle author, he employs lots of foreshadowing throughout the book, and he makes it clear from the beginning that most people will not survive Carrie's wrath. As in may of King's books, there are a few problems with the editing - the spelling of the name of Carrie's high school changes, and, although her father died before she was born, at one point King has him alive when she was a young baby. Fortunately, these minor inconsistencies do not detract from the story.This is a quick read, but an exciting thriller.

Written when Helen Keller was 22, "The Story of My Life" is about her life as a child and young lady. She was not born blind and deaf, but as a toddler suffered an illness that almost killed her and robbed her of her sight and hearing. Helen was seemingly unteachable and growing wilder each day until Helen's parents hired Anne Sullivan who was to become her beloved "Teacher". Helen became a proficient student, learning not only to read and write and speak, but also learning several languages eventually graduating from Radcliffe College.This is an extraordinary book about an extraordinary woman. The book is divided into two parts: Keller's autobiography and her letters. Her autobiography is written a bit flowery, but is interesting as she describes her early years and how she tried to communicate with people and her increasing frustration when they couldn't understand her. She writes about how Anne Sullivan finally got her to understand the word for "water" and how she quickly learned other words after that breakthrough. She tackles what was a very painful time in her young life when she was accused of plagiarizing a story when she was only 11 years old. She ends her autobiography by describing the things she loves in life: reading (books that she loves and her favorite authors), history, languages, the outdoors, sailing and visiting friends.As interesting as Keller's autobiography is, her letters reveal even more about her life. Printed in chronological order, starting when Helen was just 7 years old, the letters show how quickly her grammar and writing skills developed. In the autobiographical section of the book, it is easy to forget that Keller was deaf and blind as she writes about talking to people and things that she's seen. Her letters explain better how people communicated with her and even the toll it took on Anne Sullivan, who had continuous problems with her eyes. Her letters explain how she wrote letters using a special board and a regular pencil and how she was able to read people's lips and feel things in a museum to get an appreciation of art. Very interesting reading.My only complaint about this wonderful book is the editing. The book was first published in 1903 and has been in print ever since, but I wonder when it was last edited. There are notations that a footnote will follow but there is no footnote. There are mentions of people who were well known in Helen's time, but today's readers might not know how they were and footnotes should have been used to explain who they were, starting with Laura Bridgman who apparently was the inspiration for much of the education the young Helen got. Also, Helen raised money for the education of a blind and deaf boy, but there was no mention of what happened to him later in life.Editing aside, this is a wonderful, inspirational book and I highly recommend it.

Paige and Edvard are total opposites. She's a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin; he's a spoiled Prince, next in line to be King of Denmark. They meet when Edvard, thinking all American girls are like the ones in the Girls Gone Wild videos, enrolls at the University, hoping to meet some of the girls. After a rough start, the two fall in love. When Paige finds out that "Eddie" is really a member of royalty, she has to decide whether to follow her dream to become a doctor or to give it all up to become Queen of Denmark.This is a nice romantic comedy. Julia Stiles and Luke Mabley have nice chemistry and it's fun watching their characters interact. Ben Miller almost steals the movie as Soren, Edvard's bodyguard. There are many scenes of Edvard's home life and Paige's home life, to show the differences between the two lifestyles. There are times when the movie seems to be going in a more serious direction and exploring how much Paige would be giving up and what it really means to be a member of royalty, but unfortunately it just skirts the issue. I wish, in fact, that this movie had ended on a more open note and that a sequel had been made that concentrated more on Paige's adjustment to royal life. It would have been a much stronger movie that way, but it's still a good, fun movie to watch.

Divided into four parts, "Left for Dead" is not only about Beck Weathers' near death on Mount Everest, but his life before and after the disastrous expedition. The first part of the book describes the events on Mount Everest; the second part is autobiographical; the third part is about his depression and why he took up mountain claiming; and the fourth part is about his life today. Also discussed are his marriage woes and how his marriage survived his various obsessions (such as motorcycle riding and sailing, as well as mountain climbing). The book isn't written solely from Weather's point of view; there are reflections from other people in his life, most notably his wife, Peach."Left for Dead" is an interesting read about a flawed human being. Beck Weathers has a good, at times self-deprecating, sense of humor, and is very honest about his flaws. His wife, Peach, is aptly named, but I had to wonder why she stayed married to a man who was absent much of the time and difficult to live with when he was around. There wasn't as much about mountain climbing as I would have liked, but in the end Weathers seemed ill prepared for Everest. Mountain climbing was just an outlet for Weathers' ongoing depression and it's a miracle he wasn't hurt in some of his earlier attempts. While the book goes into much details about Beck's childhood and troubled marriage it glosses over other elements - most noticeably the cost of Beck's climbing expeditions and how Beck was able to take so much time off from work. Finally, I'd like to see an updated postscript on future editions to see how Beck and his family are doing today.This was an enjoyable read.

The movie is very loosely based upon a book by Mary Norton about the Clock family, small people (about six inches tall) who live underneath the floorboards of a house, surviving by borrowing things from humans "beans". When they are discovered, they are forced to move.I was very disappointed with this movie. The only way to enjoy this film is if you haven't read the books. The acting was good, if over the top, but that was the kind of acting needed in a film like this, which seemed to be a combination of "Home Alone" and "Mouse Hunt". But the direction was very odd. The movie seemed to be set in the 1950's, yet characters in the movie used a remote for the (black and white) TV and a cellular phone. The costuming was also odd. Yes, they had to make do with what they could "borrow" to make clothes, but their outfits, and the really odd hairdos, made them look like creatures from another planet. Also, have the cast was British and half was American, which added to the confusion about what world the movie was set in.On the other hand, the special effects were quite good. The best part of the DVD is the sequence that shows how the special effects were done. It was very interesting, but it used too many clips from the movie and not enough clips of how they did the special affects. There are also interviews with the cast, with the exception of John Goodman.Little kids will like this movie, but adults should stay away.

"The Brothers Bulger" tells the story of James "Whitey" Bulger and his brother Billy. From an early age Whitey was headed in the wrong direction in life and he soon became one of the most feared men in Boston and is currently in the top ten on the FBI's most wanted list. For a long time Billy seemed to be on the straight and narrow, at least to the public, as he became involved in politics, eventually becoming president of the Massachusetts State Senate. But "The Brothers Bulger" shows the Billy earned his nickname of "The Corrupt Midget".I'm not a big fan of Howie Carr's newspaper column in The Boston Herald and almost didn't read "The Brothers Bulger" because of that. I'm glad I did. Newspaper column to the contrary, Carr can actually write and does a good job telling the Bulger's story. I've lived in the Boston area my entire life and while aware of the Bulgers I wasn't aware of the extent of Whitey's crimes or the extent of the corruption. I was also surprised at the number of local politicians and other well known Bostonians who knew what was going on with the Bulgers and looked the other way including Michael Dukakis, Kevin White, Joe Moakley, Bill Weld, and Cardinal Law.Of the two brothers, Whitey's story, not surprisingly, is the most compelling. He is truly a brutal man, not caring who he killed, be it man or woman. One of his killings was so brutal I cringed while reading it. His dealings with the FBI are mind boggling and not very reassuring. While Billy's story is less compelling, it was still interesting to read how he maneuvered his way through Boston politics and managed to snag himself a nice sized pension from U-Mass Boston. What was especially interesting about all this is the numerous mistakes he made politically and still came out on top for a long time.As of right now, Whitey Bulger is still at large and wanted by the FBI. If he is ever found (and after reading this book I have to wonder how hard the FBI is looking for him), I hope Howie Carr is able to write a book about Whitey's years on the lam, which I'm sure would be quite interesting."The Brothers Bulger" is a compelling read.

Randall Woodfield seemed to have it all. Growing up he had a stable home life, did well in school, and was an exceptional athlete, excelling in every sport he tried. He was such a good athlete, in fact, that the Green Bay Packers drafted him. But Woodfield didn't make the team and he never finished college, instead drifting from job to job, from city to city. He also went from woman to woman, pursuing all of them intensely. Still, he seemed like a nice enough guy and people who knew him were shocked to find out that he was the I-5 killer, committing a series of robberies, terrorizing and assaulting young women, killing some of them."The I-5 Killer" is one of Ann Rule's early true crime books and it shows. It's not a bad book, but it's not as good as her later efforts. Rule focuses more on Woodfield than his victims, consequently, although the crimes against the victims were horrific, I felt detached since I never came to know what any of them were really like. There are eight pages of photos, but only one picture of a victim, which also adds to the feeling of detachment. Woodfield's trial had a bit more detail to it and was quite interesting.This isn't a bad book, but someone trying Ann Rule for the first time should try reading one of her newer books.

Steffi McCann came from Cincinnati, Ohio to Moose-Lookit Island in Maine to do an internship on the newspaper "The Weekly Islander". Her elderly bosses at the newspaper, Vince Teague and Dave Bowie, have plenty to teach her, including the fact that, unlike newspaper stories, real life doesn't always have stories that come neatly wrapped in packages with a beginning, middle, and end. To illustrate that point, they tell her the story of a body found on the beach, the body of the man they call the "Colorado Kid".Early on in this short novel, Stephen King warns readers that the mystery of the Colorado Kid will not be solved. This may keep some from reading this book, but that would be their loss. "The Colorado Kid" is a wonderful example of what Stephen King does best - create characters that you care about and want to know more about, long after you've finished reading the book. Vince and Dave are the standout characters in this book, so well written that at times I felt that they were talking to me instead of Steffi. Steffi is not written as clearly (and the book cover, which I guess is supposed to be an illustration of her, is a distraction) but King does write enough so that we know her as a character. Readers will even come to know the mysterious Colorado Kid and wonder why and how did he travel from Colorado to Maine and did he really choke to death on a piece of steak or was he murdered?Perhaps the best part is that King does not answer those questions, but lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions. To further stir debate, King hints on his website that "The Colorado Kid" may have some connection to his Dark Tower series which opens even more possibilities and more questions in this reader's mind."The Colorado Kid" is a multi-layered and well-written book and not to be missed.

"16 Lighthouse Road" is the first book in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series and it focuses on the lives of several people living there. Cecelia and Ian Randall married when Cecelia became pregnant, but their baby died while Navy man Ian was at sea. Now they want to divorce because Cecelia can't forgive Ian for not being there when she needed him the most. Judge Olivia Lockhart catches newspaper editor Jack Griffin's attention when she is reluctant to grant the divorce until the Randall's try to work things out. Olivia is attracted to Jack, but is concerned about her daughter Justine who is dating a much older man. Olivia's friend Grace Sherman is having problems with her husband Dan - after thirty-five years of marriage he has walked out and disappeared without any explanation. Finally, there is Olivia's mother, Charlotte Jefferson, who befriended an elderly man shortly before he died and is trying to track down his family to return the few possessions he left behind.I really enjoyed "16 Lighthouse Road" and bought the rest of the books in the series as soon as I finished reading it. Debbie Macomber's writing can be awkward at times and the book often sounds like a soap opera. She can be melodramatic to a fault, saying one character will never be a grandfather because his son is sterile - has she never heard of adoption? But despite her writing flaws, Macomber is a great storyteller and she creates characters that readers will care about. The book doesn't focus on any one character but tells each character's story equally. Some of the stories, such as Ian and Cecelia's come to a close, but others, such as Grace and Dan's are left open. This can be frustrating and feel like a cheat to readers who want everything tied up neatly at the end, but Macomber had me caring enough about the characters to make me want to read the other books in the series to find out what happens to them. That's the mark of a truly gifted storyteller."16 Lighthouse Road" is a well-done soap opera in book form.

Arrietty Clock and her parents, Pod and Homily, are tiny people who live beneath the floor of an old house and `borrow' the things they need from the humans who live in the house above. At one point, many borrowers lived in the house, but the others emigrated for various reasons and only the Clocks live in the house. While her parents seem happy, Arrietty longs to see the world outside. Her mother finally persuades Pod to take her borrowing and her first time out, she meets the boy upstairs. The boy is as curious about Arrietty as she is about him, and they become friends, with the boy bringing the family all kinds of gifts, furniture, food, jewelry, etc. Unfortunately, the boy takes too much and the housekeeper notices things are missing. Soon the Clocks are forced to flee.This is a terrific book on many levels. It is a book about friendship, different cultures, greediness and fear. The book is so well written that you really do believe the Borrowers exist. After all, who hasn't lost a pencil, safety pins, needles, etc.?Now that I've finished this book, I want to read the rest of the books in the series!

In this sequel to the 2001 hit movie "The Princess Diaries", Mia (a charming Anne Hathaway) has graduated from Princeton and moves to Genovia to prepare to take over the role of Queen from her grandmother Clarisse (a regal Julie Andrews). Her preparations, however, hit a snag when it is discovered that she must marry in 30 days or forfeit the crown to Nicholas Deveraux (a handsome Chris Pine). Mia now struggles to complete her training to become Queen (she's still a bit of a klutz), as well as look for a husband, while Nicholas's uncle, Viscount Mabrey (an appropriately evil Jonathan Rhys-Davies) does everything he can to sabotage Mia so Nicholas will inherit the crown. Mia soon becomes engaged to Andrew Jacoby (a bland Callum Blue) but she finds herself attracted to Nicholas and has to decide whether she will sacrifice love to become Queen.Young girls (the target audience) who loved the first movie will also love this one. They'll laugh over Mia's clumsiness, drool over Nicholas, think the slumber party is lots of fun, laugh at the antics of the dog and cat, giggle at Mia's ladies maids, and sigh over the romance between Mia and Nicholas. As an adult who usually likes these kind of movies and who enjoyed the first movie, I thought the movie tried way too hard. A little of Mia's clumsiness goes a long way (how many times did we really need to see Mia learning to shoot a bow and arrow, destroying things along the way?). A scene in which Mia stopped a parade to let orphans join in fell flat. The slumber party scene went on far too long, although it was a joy to hear Julie Andrews sing again. But even that scene was partially ruined by having Raven (who appears to be thrown into the movie only because she has a show on the Disney Channel) join in the song. Anne Hathaway showed that she could sing in "Ella Enchanted" and it would have made more sense for her to sing the duet with Andrews. Anyone who has seen these types of movies could see the "twist" that takes place at the wedding coming a mile away. Finally, a scene in which Mia and Nicholas spend the night together (dismissed with a single line saying "nothing happened") seemed inappropriate, although children probably won't get the implications.This isn't a terrible movie, just not a great one. Put it in the DVD player and let your daughter watch it alone, dreaming of her own Prince Charming.

Compiled and edited in 1889 by Ednah Cheney, this book offers an interesting look into the life of Louisa May Alcott. Cheney intersperses the letters and journal entries with some biographical information. The Alcotts were very poor and lived off the money Louisa made from her writing; Alcott keeps track of how much money she gets for each story, even after the success of "Little Women". Unfortunately, the amount of time she spent writing (up to 14 hours a day), plus the illness she caught after nursing civil war soldiers took a toll on her and many of her letters, plus many of the journal entries mention her various illnesses and describe how she had to take morphine to help her sleep.Fans of "Little Women" will be most interested in the segments regarding that book and may be surprised to find out that Alcott thought the book was boring. It's hard to believe she really meant that because it's clear from her letters and journal entries how very biographical "Little Women" is. In fact, Alcott's journal description of Beth's death in real life is used almost word for word in the book. Other elements in "Little Women" are fiction (there was, alas, no real life Professor Bhaer and Alcott included him against her better judgement - she would have preferred Jo remain single, as Alcott herself did) and Teddy was based on a Polish acquaintance, not a next door neighbor. However, the four sisters are based on Louisa and her sisters and the journal entries and letters make you realize how perfectly she caught them on paper.This is an interesting book about not only a fascinating woman but also a fascinating family. The Alcotts' friends included the Emersons, the Thoreaus and the Hawthornes, all whose influences helped shape Louisa May Alcott's writings. Despite her success, her life was not an easy one and was often filled with sorrow. Yet, despite her sorrow and illnesses, Louise May Alcott's works enchanted children then and now.

"Summer of `49" focuses on the rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees as they fought for first place during the Summer of 1949. This was before the days of the wild card and first place meant a trip to the playoffs while second place meant a trip home. The two teams fought for first place all season long and (perhaps fittingly) it all came down to the last game of the season."Summer of `49" is an excellent book about baseball, the men that played it, the men who ran it, the men who called the games on the radio, and the fans who loved the game. Author David Halberstam focuses mostly on the players (rightfully so) and does an evenhanded job of portraying players on both teams. Halberstam provides a fascinating glimpse at players such as Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Ellis Kinder of the Red Sox and Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, and Vic Raschi of the Yankees. Equally interesting to read was the relationship between brothers Joe and Dom DiMaggio (Joe played for the Yankees while Dom played for the Red Sox). Also featured in the book are the managers of the Yankees and Red Sox - Casey Stengel and Joe McCarthy. Another person I found fascinating to read about and wish I had been able to hear announce games was Mel Allen.Halberstam also provides an interesting insight into what the game of baseball was like during the 1940's. It was an age when starting pitchers pitched entire games whenever possible and relief pitchers were not specialists; a time before the designated hitter; and a time before the wild card. I was not alive then, but as a once long-suffering Red Sox fan (2004 changed all that), I could picture how frustrating that year must have been for Boston fans. Halberstam does a good job of describing game action and I could feel the anguish of the Red Sox players and fans after that final game.Published in 1989, "Summer of '49" is a bit dated at the end (both Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams are still alive at the end of the book and Williams is developing a relationship with and yet to be manipulated by his son John Henry), but it is excellently done and I highly recommend it.

"The Education of a Coach" is not only about how Bill Belichick came to win three super bowls in four years, but the people that helped shape his career along the way, notably his father Steve. The book talks about Steve's years as a coach and how Bill was involved with football from an early age. The book also talks about Bill's involvement in football in school, his first job in football, his time with the Giants, his disastrous stint with Cleveland, and of course his current stint with the Patriots. The book also touches on his relationships, for better or worse, with football insiders including Bill Parcells, Ernie Adams, and Scott Pioli, among others.As the title suggests "The Education of a Coach" is more about Bill Belichick the coach than Bill Belichick the person. There are glimpses into what makes him tick - his quest for privacy, why he doesn't do well with the media, why he treats all his players as equals - that make him even more interesting. But much of his personal life - his marriage and later divorce, his children - are barely mentioned. But that fits the way Belichick is, a very private person. And what is at the heart of this book - Belichick's football life - is fascinating. Some readers may be disappointed that there's not more about his family, but once you've read the book you realize that football is Belichick's life.Because "The Education of a Coach" was written in 2005, there is, of course, no mention of "spygate". It's hard not to think about it while reading the book and it was interesting to read about Belichick's preoccupation with studying football film. It's something he started doing at a young age with his father and is, to me anyway, one of the most interesting aspects of his character.Love him or hate him, Bill Belichick is one of the most talented and complex coaches in football. "The Education of a Coach" is a good glimpse into what made him one of the best coaches in football today. Well done.

From the beginning, Ted Williams was a larger than life personality - a great player on the field, the last baseball player to hit over .400 - and a player off the field as well, married three times, but never to the true love of his life. His antics on and off the field were legendary, as were his breaks from baseball to serve in both World War II and Korea. And, of course, his relationship with his children, especially son John Henry, led to headlines long after his career and life were over."Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero" by Leigh Montville is a wonderfully written look at the colorful Williams. Montville covers all aspects of Williams's life, from his childhood and troubled relationship with his parents (especially his mother), his career in Boston, his tumultuous relationship with Boston sports writers, his life after baseball, his troubled relationship with his children, and of course his controversial freezing after his death. Williams was a complex man and Montville does his best to show what made Williams tick. It's not an easy task, Williams was prickly and had two sides to his personality - the public Ted and the private Ted. By the end of the book you will both love and hate Williams - you'll love the public Ted that associated so well with fans (at least off the field and especially the young ones - Williams was instrumental in helping the Jimmy Fund, which supports young cancer patients, get off the ground) and hate the private Ted, who made life difficult for those around him.For the most part, Montville is objective in his writing, treating both the private Ted and public Ted even-handedly and making no excuses for his behavior. But his objectivity slips near the end of the book when he discusses Williams's son John Henry. It's clear that Montville doesn't like John Henry. As much as your feelings for Ted may waver throughout the book, by the end you can't help but feel sorry for him and the way his family treated him the last few years of his life."Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero" is an interesting look at a complex man.

When two Supreme Court justices are assassinated on the same night, there is plenty of speculation as to who the assassin or assassins are and why the judges were murdered. Like many others, law student Darby Shaw thinks she knows the motive. She writes a brief, soon to be known as The Pelican Brief, and shows it to her law professor/lover, Thomas Callahan. Unfortunately, he shows it to a friend of his who works for the FBI, who passes it along, and it falls into the wrong hands. When Callahan is killed by a car bomb, Darby realizes someone wants her dead and she goes on the run. She hooks up with Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham and the two of them try to stay alive long enough to expose the truth.This was an exciting but implausible thriller. Darby is a well-written character and it's nice to read a book with a strong, intelligent heroine. Unfortunately, it's not clear until well into the book what Darby's feelings for Callahan really were, it should have been clear earlier that she loved him and was not a student having an affair with a professor in order to get an A. She conveniently has plenty of money, so she can use cash on the run, rather than leave a trail by using plastic. And it strains readers credibility that a law student can outwit trained assassins. Some of the other characters in the book blend into each other and I wasn't always clear as to who some of them were. Grisham does clear up some loose ends, but at the last minute, as if he suddenly remembered them.Despite these flaws, the story is exciting enough to keep the reader turning pages and worth reading as long as you don't think too much about it.

For Christmas, Billy Peltzer's father gives him a cute, furry creature known as a Mogwai that he bought in Chinatown. Billy is warned that he must follow three rules with the Mogwai, whom he names Gizmo: 1) keep him out of light, especially sunlight; 2) don't get him wet; and 3) never feed him after midnight. It doesn't take long before the rules are broken and disaster ensues: the Gremlins multiply and none of them are as cute and lovable as Gizmo. The Gremlins cause much destruction and mayhem in Billy's quiet little town and he and his girlfriend, Kate, rush to stop them before the town is totally destroyed.Gremlins is a great movie that has a bit of everything: humor, horror, parody and even romance. Billy's town is straight out of "It's A wonderful Life" and the rich and not so nice Mrs. Deagle is a modern day Miss Gulch from The Wizard of Oz. Outside of some scene's in the Peltzer's kitchen and what happens to Mrs. Deagle, the Gremlins are more mischievous than deadly. However, the kitchen scenes are a bit gruesome and not suitable for younger viewers. Most of the film is darkly comic, if a bit violent, especially the bar scene, the scene where the Gremlins call caroling at Mrs. Deagle's house, and the movie theater scene, as well as the final climax. The one scene that feels out of place to me is when Kate describes why she hates Christmas. I've seen the movie many times and still wonder why that scene was left in.The acting is quite good in this movie. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates have a nice chemistry together and make a sweet couple. Frances Lee McCain is excellent as Billy's terrorized mother and Hoyt Axton does a great job as Billy's lovable but inept inventor father (some of the funniest scenes in the movie revolve around his inventions). Dick Miller is good as Billy's paranoid neighbor, and Polly Holiday chews up the scenery as the cruel Mrs. Deagle. Judge Reinhold shows up briefly as a potential love rival for Kate and then disappears from the movie, as does Corey Feldman as Billy's young neighbor.This movie isn't for everyone's taste. I saw the movie with a friend who hated it saying she didn't see anything funny about people being killed at Christmas. Personally, I thought it was wickedly funny and recommend it to fans of darkly comic horror movies.

In this installment in the Mrs. Jeffries mystery series, Smythe's friend, Blimpey Groggins asks Inspector Gerald Witherspoon's household staff, to investigate a murder. His friend, Tommy Odell, has been found guilty of killing a woman and is scheduled to hang for the crime in a few weeks, but Blimpey is convinced that Tommy is innocent. The staff agrees to help, but they realize it's going to be difficult to find clues in a case that is considered already solved. To complicate things further, it wasn't Witherspoon's case; it belonged to Inspector Nivens, Witherspoon's nemesis. Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of the staff have their work cut out for them if they wish to save an innocent man from hanging.Emily Brightwell has done it once again. Even after writing over 20 Mrs. Jeffries books, she manages to keep the series from going stale. Having the staff investigate a murder that is considered already solved was a great plot device and worked well. It also ups the animosity between Witherspoon and Nivens and opens up lots of possibilities for plot developments in future books in the series. What makes this series so good is how the characters continue to develop in each book and especially Inspector Witherspoon in this book. Some fans of the series will be disappointed that there's no Luty and Hatchet in this entry, but there is plenty of Ruth Cannonberry in exchange. It was also nice to see more of Blimpey and Brightwell adds a neat twist at the end of the book to make his character even more likable. The mystery is nicely plotted and while I thought I knew who the murderer was, I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong.Highly recommended!

The Elgin Travel Alarm Clock has several features that I like. It is battery operated, which is convenient not only when traveling but in case the electricity goes out at home and you need a functional clock. It has a protective cover so the clock face won't get scratched during travel - said cover doubles as a stand for the clock. The clock not only shows the time (you have a choice of a twelve hour or twenty-four hour format), but the date (date and month, not including year or day of the week). The numbers are easy to read, even for someone as nearsighted as I am. There is also a backlight that activates for approximately five seconds and then automatically shuts off. There is also an alarm feature; a snooze button (this shuts off the alarm for five minutes and then it automatically sounds again); and a nap timer which you can set in fifteen minute increments for up to four hours of nap time. All of the alarm features are loud, but not annoyingly so. Unlike other reviewers, my clock has kept perfect time and hasn't gained any minutes after over a month of usage.While I really like the Elgin Travel Alarm Clock and use it all the time (even when not travelling), there are a couple of things that I don't like about it. The buttons to unlock the mechanism to set the alarm, time, and calendar are all on one side and it's a bit tricky to use them. The snooze alarm and backlight are activated by the same button - you press the left side to activate the snooze alarm and the right side to activate the light - and on several occasions I've woken up in the middle of the night and went to activate the light to see what time it was only to inadvertently activate the snooze alarm instead. On those occasions I've had to turn on a light to figure out how to deactivate the snooze alarm (which isn't all that easy to do.) Also, you have to be very careful to make sure the door to the battery compartment is on tight. I accidentally knocked the clock to the floor one night, dislodging the door, and the clock started making a grating beeping noise until I figured out how to latch the door properly - not a fun thing at 3:00 in the morning!All in all, I really like and get a lot of use out of the Elgin Travel Alarm Clock.

Omri receives several gifts for his birthday, including a cupboard and a plastic action figure of an Indian. That night he discovers that he can make the Indian, Little Bear, come to life by putting him in the cupboard. Bear builds a house but yearns to return to his "other" life. In the meantime, Omri's friend, Patrick, is envious of Little Bear and puts a plastic cowboy in the cupboard and brings him to life. Soon the Cowboy, Boone and Little Bear are fighting and Omri must seek help when Boone is wounded. Eventually Omri learns some important lessons about real and play lives.This is a good movie for both adults and children. The special effects are good. There's a nice fantasy element and lessons are learned without preaching. Frank Oz, the Director, tends to be a little too fancy at times with his camera shots, which, for an adult at least, interferes with the story, but kids probably won't mind.The DVD comes with very few extra features. Viewers have a choice between Full Screen and Wide Screen versions, which is a great option. There's also a Director's Commentary and a few still pictures from the movie, including some with the oversized props used in the film. I wish they had done a feature on how the special effects were done instead of those few pictures.I've never read the book, so I can't compare the movie to it. However, the watching the movie makes me want to buy the book!

Recently divorced Abby Shaw returns to Paradise, Colorado to run the Divinity Candy Shop, which she inherited from her Aunt Grace. Though some of the people living in Paradise are a bit cool towards Abby until she proves herself; men's clothing storeowner Brandon Mills seems attracted to her. Since he has quite the reputation as a ladies man, Abby's not sure about his true feelings but never has a chance to find out when he is murdered. Brandon's death is a shock for Abby in many ways - she discovers that Brandon was not who she thought he was and was in fact disliked by many people in town. While that means there are many suspects in his murder, the police are focusing on Abby's brother, Wyatt. Wyatt certainly has a motive - he suspects his wife had an affair with Brandon - but he insists he didn't do it and Abby believes him. Now she has to convince hunky Police Officer Tawarski of Wyatt's innocence while trying to find the killer herself to clear his name."Candy Apple Dead" is a nice cozy mystery. Abby is a well-written, well-rounded character. Her struggles to prove herself capable of running the candy store and convince the town people of the same are very believable. Her struggle to reconcile the Brandon she knew with the person others said he was is heartbreaking. Her relationship with her brother is also very believable - anxious to clear his name, Abby realizes he is hiding something from her and her fear and frustration is well written. The candy store setting is a nice one and I loved the small details about candy making and how Abby decorated the store for the holidays. In fact, I wish there was more of that in the book. I liked the fact that Abby had a legitimate reason for investigating the murder - clearing her brother's name - instead of a manufactured one that happens so often in cozy mysteries. The mystery itself is well plotted, although only the most astute readers will note an important clue to the murderer."Candy Apple Dead" is a sweet read.

The first part of "Tara Road", which is a bit slow, tells the story of Ria Lynch, her marriage to Danny Lynch, and her life with him and their two children as they buy a house and renovate it on Tara Road. It also tells the stories of Ria's friends, especially Rosemary Ryan, not quite the friend she appears to be; Gertie, a battered wife who is so used to living a lie that she actually believes it; and Colm, who is struggling to run a restaurant while dealing with his sister's problems."Tara Road" picks up pace in the second part, when Ria's life takes an unexpected turn, and she switches houses with Marilyn Vine, an American, who is dealing (not very well) with a tragedy in her life. While the reader knows all about Ria's life (more, in fact than she does), the reader discovers Marilyn's story at the same time as Ria does. In the end, Ria's stay in Connecticut and Marilyn's stay on Tara Road, change them both in ways they never imagined.Although a bit too long (the first part drags at times), this was an enjoyable read and towards the end, I couldn't put it down. As always, Binchey fills the book with memorable characters, some of whom you'll like, others would will dislike quite a bit. I highly recommend "Tara Road".

The title, "A Cinderella Story", pretty much sums up the plot of this movie. Sam is a high school student living with her stepmother and stepsisters after her father dies. When she's not in school, Sam either works at the family diner or does chores around the house while her stepmother suns herself and her stepsisters practice their synchronized swimming routine. Her dream is to go to Princeton, and while in a Princeton chatroom, she strikes up an on-line relationship with someone at her school who also wants to go the Princeton. She arranges to meet her anonymous on-line friend at a school dance, but chickens out when she realizes he's the captain of the football team. Her stepsisters find out about the on-line relationship and arrange to have her humiliated in front of the whole school. Sam must learn how to stand up for herself and against those who hurt her before she can find love.The acting is as expected in a movie like this. Hilary Duff is good as Sam and Chad Michael Murray as Austin has the rugged good looks of a teen idol and no doubt a poster of him is hanging in many a teenager girl's bedroom. Regina King is a standout as Sam's friend at the diner, but it's Jennifer Coolidge as Sam's botoxed, self-indulgent stepmother who steals the movie.This is a fluffy yet fun movie for women of all ages (and the type of movie most men hate). There's nothing really new in the plot, although it's nice that Sam's best friend is a boy, and that Austin is shown as having problems and is more than just a pretty face. "A Cinderella Story" is a good movie to watch when you want to be entertained without thinking too hard.

Cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman's shop "A Good Yarn" has thrived since she opened it a year ago. She decides to teach a class on how to knit socks and three people sign up for it.Elise Beaumont is a retired librarian who has recently suffered a financial setback and was forced to move in with her daughter's family. Elise has been divorced for many years but never stopped loving her ex-husband, "Maverick", whose gambling ruined their marriage. Elise is not pleased when she finds out that Maverick is coming to stay at their daughter's house - she's afraid of getting hurt again.Bethanne Hamlin is also divorced, although much more recently. The divorce came out of the blue; she had no idea that her marriage was in trouble until her husband told her on Valentine's Day that he was leaving her for a younger woman. The divorce left Bethanne demoralized; she needs to find a job but is convinced she's a failure. Her teenage children, Annie and Andrew, are also affected by the divorce, especially Annie who keeps acting out in her pain.Courtney Pulanski is also a troubled teenager. Her mother died in a car accident four years ago and Courtney is still mourning her death. With two kids in college and Courtney a senior in high school, her father needs money and takes a well-paying job building bridges in Brazil and Courtney is forced to move in with her grandmother and spend her senior year in a strange high school. Courtney is overweight and self-conscious about her looks and is convinced that her senior year will be miserable.Lydia has problems of her own; her sister Margaret has financial worries and may lose her house and is miserable to be around. Lydia is in love with UPS driver Brad, but he will soon deliver devastating news that threatens their relationship. Her mother's health is deteriorating and Lydia worries about her well being. All four women will find more comfort than they could possibly believe while learning how to knit socks."A Good Yarn" is a great book for someone looking for a sweet, unchallenging read. The characters are all likable and believable, except perhaps for Maverick who is a bit of a clich&eacute;. Debbie Macomber is a good writer who makes you care for her characters in such a way that you will want to keep reading the book to find out what happens to each woman, yet you'll be sorry when the book is finally over. I do wish she had shown Courtney at her senior prom, but that's a minor quibble. Macomber ties everything up neatly at the end (and is to be commended for not having each woman find happiness only through a romantic relationship) and I loved the fairy godfather touch at the end.This is a perfect book for reading at the beach or on a rainy day.

Young Coraline's family has recently moved into a new house and she is just starting to explore the house and getting to know her neighbors, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and the old man who lives upstairs with his pet mice. She hasn't met any other children in the area yet so she has plenty of time to explore the house. But she gets more than she expected when she steps through a mysterious door in the house and finds another house almost exactly like hers and another mother and another father who look just like her parents. But they really aren't like her parents at all and soon Coraline is in a fight to return to her ordinary life and her ordinary parents."Coraline" is Neil Gaiman's delightfully quirky book that is aimed at readers ages eight and up but can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. While Gaiman creates a bizarre alternate world once Coraline goes through the door, the real world she lives in is a bit odd as well. Her parents basically ignore her, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible are obsessed with their dogs and the man upstairs is obsessed with his mice. Once she is through the door, Gaiman creates a world that seems familiar to Coraline but gets creepier the longer she stays there. Gaiman does a great job of creating the parallel world (I love what he does with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and the talking cat). Coraline (not Caroline - nice touch) is a strong heroine who grows stronger throughout the course of the book as she has to save several people, including herself from a horrible fate. The world Gaiman creates is deliciously creepy but may be a bit too scary for younger readers."Coraline" is a wonderfully dark book for readers of all ages.

"Rumspringa" is mainly about the Amish coming of age ritual in which the Amish youth are allowed to run around with the "English", but it is also a fascinating look at Amish life in general. The Amish life is a rigid one, especially for the women, and it is not surprising that some of the youth don't return after their Rumspringa. The price they pay if they don't return is a steep one - not only other Amish, but also their own family shun them, but it is a price some have to pay to be true to themselves."Rumspringa" is a well-written and well-researched look at Amish life. Author Tom Shachtman interviewed a lot of Amish in the course of writing the book and their conversations are enlightening. While the book is mostly about Rumspringa, all aspects of Amish life are covered and some are eye opening. Much is made of how the Amish youth act during Rumspringa (excess drugs, alcohol, and sex) and while some behavior is self-destructive, many young Amish choose to not return to Amish life because their choices are limited. Ironically, while the Amish school system provides a better education than public schools, that education is limited (for example, science is not taught and most are not educated past eighth grade). Because of that, their life choices are limited - girls are expected to stay at home, get married and raise a family, while the boys are expected to work the farm. It is no wonder some choose to leave, although the price they pay is a high one.For the most part, Shachtman does a good job of not being too judgmental. He strays a bit, especially when trying to make the teens actions during Rumspringa shocking. But for the most part his writing is straightforward and lets the story tell itself without making it too sensational. His look into the Amish life is very revealing, at times interesting and heartwarming and other times a bit shocking (there are allegations of child abuse). All of this is very informative.In the end, I learned a lot about the Amish way of life by reading "Rumspringa".

Michael J. Fox begins his autobiography telling of his discovery one morning that his pinkie was twitching, a discovery that would ultimately change the course of his life when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. He then flashes back to his childhood in Canada and his relationship with his parents, siblings and his beloved Nana. Fox talks about his struggles in school (he eventually dropped out of high school) and his success as an actor in Canada which inspired him to move to California where he struggled for three years before landing the role of Alex on "Family Ties". For a while he enjoyed the perks of fame, getting free stuff whenever he wanted, lots of drinking and partying, but his marriage to Tracy Pollan, having children, and Parkinson's helped settle him down.This is a fascinating look at the life of Michael J. Fox. Readers expecting anecdotes about the filming of "Family Ties", "Back to the Future" or any of his works will be disappointed, as there is little writing of what goes on behind the scenes, in fact, he says he barely remembers filming "Back to the Future". Outside of an unpleasant encounter with Cher, little is mentioned about other actors, even his costars. Instead, he writes about his private life - his childhood, his family, his living the good life as an actor, his heavy drinking, and his love for his wife and children and the effect Parkinson's has had on his life. I liked this approach; the glimpses into Fox's private life made him seem more real. He's not afraid to poke fun at himself, especially recounting how his family reacted to his winning an Emmy. He is also brutally frank about his heavy drinking and the effect it had on his marriage. And he doesn't pull any punches in describing how Parkinson's has effected his life.This is a good read.

I saw the play "Annie" several times and loved it each time. This movie is a wonderful version of the play. It's much more faithful to the play than the original movie with Carol Burnette. The cast, Alicia Morton, Victor Garber,Kathy Bates, Audra McDonald, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth, were all wonderful and perfect for the roles they played. Andrea McArdle(the original Annie) sparkled in a cameo. Fans of the original play might be disappointed that almost all political references have been eliminated (F.D.R. was basically a cameo role), but it really didn't affect the movie all that much. I'm especially happy that they left the movie set at Christmas time, the original movie for some reason was set in the summer. The fact that it is Christmas adds to the magic of the movie.After watching this, I went around singing the songs for about a week after! This is a good, fun, film for the whole family to watch.

Lindsey Meeks is climbing the corporate ladder and not looking for a relationship when she meets math teacher Ben Wrightman. She initially turns him down when he asks her out, but he persists and she agrees to go out with him, only to be stricken with food poisoning the day of their first date. She is smitten when Ben takes care of her and soon they are in a serious relationship. He seems to be perfect and Lindsey's friends urge her to be cautious since it seems strange that such a great guy is still single. Ben tells Lindsey that he's a huge Red Sox fan, and his apartment is full of Red Sox memorabilia, but it is not until baseball season starts that Lindsey realizes how fanatical Ben really is. He starts blowing Lindsey off, including a trip to Paris, for his beloved Red Sox and Lindsey, after a pregnancy scare, begins to question if she can stay in a relationship with him. Soon Ben is torn between his love for the Red Sox and his love for Lindsey. Which will he choose?This is a cute romantic comedy, although I'm not sure if non-Red Sox fans will enjoy it as much as I did. It's not always laugh out loud funny, but there are some very funny moments. One particular scene, when Ben replays over and over again the scene of the ball going through Bill Buckner's leg, will make Red Sox fans laugh, while nodding sympathetically. Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are a cute couple, although he is more believable as a fun loving math teacher than she is as a driven career woman, mostly because it's never quite clear what she does or why she enjoys it so much. The Farrelly brothers had to change the ending of "Fever Pitch" when the Red Sox won the World Series and the ending feels rushed. It probably would have been a funnier ending if the Red Sox had lost.Viewers might be surprised that this is a straight romantic comedy by the Farrelly Brothers who are known more for their gross out jokes that make you laugh despite yourself. It's not nearly as funny as "There's Something About Mary" but it's still fun.

Sylvester, the Duke of Salford, has decided it's time to take a wife, and has made a list of suitable candidates. When he runs the list by his Godmother, she asks him to add her granddaughter, Phoebe Marlow, to the list. When he meets Phoebe, he realizes she doesn't meet his requirements that she be well-born, intelligent, elegant and attractive. Phoebe isn't thrilled at the idea of marrying Sylvester either, she had met him before and disliked him enough to portray him as a villain in a novel she has written. She runs away to her godmother, rather than have to marry him. But circumstances bring her and Sylvester together more than once, and they slowly find themselves falling in love.This was an enjoyable and funny read. Some compare it to Pride and Prejudice, I noticed the likeness especially in Sylvester's proposal to Phoebe. I enjoyed the characters of Tom Orde and Edmund. I would have liked to see more of Phoebe's sisters, however. Sir Nugent made me laugh out loud at times with his foolishness.Sylvester is the perfect book for fans of Regency romances.

If I had to pick just one women's magazine to subscribe to, "Good Housekeeping" would be the one. It has many of the same articles that all women's magazines have: articles on health, fitness, finance, relationships, diet, beauty, and fashion. But "Good Housekeeping" goes beyond the surface in these articles, for example, their fashion articles don't focus just on high-priced clothing, instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost. There are also advice columnists on things like household hints, etiquette, and relationships. Each issue also has a short story. There's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue.What I like about "Good Housekeeping" are the in-depth articles. Most magazines today publish articles that are only a page or so long, but many articles in "Good Housekeeping" are several pages long. The articles are often about ordinary people making a difference in the world. There are usually cautionary articles for parents with young children and/or teenagers that can be frightening (a recent article was about a sexually abusive male babysitter) but very useful. As with many magazines, Good Housekeeping also has an on-line counterpart, where readers can post messages about current issues as well as enter contests.Well worth subscribing to.

After accusing each other of infidelity, Jerry and Lucy impulsively decide to divorce. They have to wait until the divorce is final, but in the meantime each begins to date other people. Lucy dates an oilman from Oklahoma and Jerry has great fun doing everything he can to ruin the romance including telling her how much she'll like Oklahoma's night life compared to New York's. Lucy gets her revenge by pretending to be his sister when Jerry dates a rich socialite. When they're not trying to sabotage each other's relationships, Jerry and Lucy are fighting over the custody of their dog, Mr. Smith."The Awful Truth" is one of the funniest screwball comedies that I've ever seen. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are a delight as the feuding couple who truly deserve each other. There are many laugh out loud scenes in this movie - including when Jerry thinks Lucy is having an affair with her voice teacher and bursts in on what he thinks is the two of them; an off-screen fight between Jerry and said voice teacher; Jerry's date with a nightclub singer, and many many more. There are plenty of double entendres and sight gags to keep you laughing. From the very beginning you know how the movie is going to end, but it's a lot of fun getting to that ending."The Awful Truth" is awfully funny.

Shane Abbott has inherited her great-grandmother's house and decides to turn part of it into a combination antique store/museum. The house needs a lot of work and she decides to hire her next door neighbor, Vance Banning, to do the work because she thinks he is a carpenter. Initially Vance tries to avoid Shane, but there's an attraction between the two of them he can't resist and he reluctantly agrees to help. Vance is increasingly attracted to Shane and she makes it clear that she is attracted to him, but Vance has been keeping some secrets from Shane and wonders how he can tell her the truth about himself and his past. As Shane wonders what is going on with Vance, her less than loving mother reappears in her life and further threatens the relationship between Vance and Shane. Vance can only hope that the love between the two of them will hold up through all their troubles."First Impressions" was the first book by Nora Roberts that I've read and, while it had it's moments, I didn't really like it. Shane is a spunky enough heroine, determined to make a success of her new business. She's a well-developed and well-written character, a bit flawed but lovable, especially with her tendency to giggle at the wrong time. But Vance is not well developed at all. Roberts tries, but Vance's struggles with his business success aren't very compelling. Shane's mother, Anne, has no redeeming qualities at all. She's a cardboard character and comes across like a villain in a Disney cartoon. The romance between Vance and Shane moves quickly, too quickly; within a week of meeting him Shane says she's in love with Vance and going to marry him. There's a nice scene in the book when Shane's car gets stuck in the mud and Vance helps her to get it out. It was funny and romantic and the book could have used more scenes like that. The final conflict between Vance and Shane is too contrived as Vance had plenty of time and opportunities to tell Shane about himself."First Impressions" was not very impressive.

Twelve year old Katy Carr and her five brothers and sisters have all kinds of fun adventures. A thicket becomes "Paradise", a hayloft a place for a "feast", and the entire house a playground for games invented by Katy. Katy means well, but is impulsive and irresponsible and is constantly getting into scrapes and trouble. After the Carr's Cousin Helen visits, Katy vows to be more like Cousin Helen, who is saint-like despite the fact that she had a bad accident and hasn't been able to walk for years. Unfortunately, Katy gets into the worst scrape of her life the very next day - disobeying her Aunt Izzie, she herself has a terrible accident. It will take Katy a long time to recover and in the course of her recovery she grows into a beautiful, responsible young woman.I loved reading "What Katy Did" as a child and it's still fun to read as an adult. Written in the 1870's, it is definitely old-fashioned, but it makes me yearn for the days when life was so much simpler. Susan Coolidge writes as if she is sitting opposite the reader, verbally telling the story and uses words that children might use such as "honestest" which makes the book a pleasant read. Coolidge also includes humor that children won't get, but adults will, such as when Katy gives Aunt Izzie $7.25 and a long list of Christmas presents to buy with that small amount of money. Katy is a very realistic heroine; yes, she gets into mischief, but what child doesn't, and she means well. The rest of the children are equally engaging, for me Elsie stands out. Cousin Helen is indeed saintly, almost unbelievable in her goodness, but Coolidge makes her believable also."What Katy Did" is a nice, old-fashioned read.

Jane Jeffry, Shelley Nowack, and the rest of their neighbors are thrilled that a Hollywood movie is being filmed in the field behind their houses. Initially they enjoy meeting actors such as Lynette Harwell and George Abington as well as director Roberto Cavagnari. They also enjoy the glimpses into what goes on behind the scenes of a major movie. But Jane and Shelley soon find out the truth behind the glamour - Lynette is totally spoiled, thinking only of herself and not noticing or caring who she hurts as long as she gets her own way. So when property master Jake Elder is murdered, Lynette barely seems to notice. But Jane does - her boyfriend Detective Mel VanDyne is in charge of the murder investigation and unless he solves the case quickly, he won't be able to go away for the weekend with Jane. So Jane, with Shelley's help, begins to question the actors and others on the set, not only to solve the murder but also to find out who trashed her kitchen. And when there is a second murder, and Jane is now a suspect, she has even more incentive to find the killer."A Knife to Remember" by Jill Churchill is a nicely done cozy mystery. The movie setting is a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the other Jane Jeffry mysteries. The behind the scenes look into the movies was very interesting. The various actors and their personalities add a lot to the book, especially the spoiled Lynnette and the people working behind the scenes in the movie, notably nurse Maisie Valkenberg, Lynette's devoted helper Olive Longabach, and Jake's assistant Butch Kowalski. Jane is a fully developed character at this point in the series, ready to move into a deeper relationship with Mel yet still capable of being hurt when she finds out about yet another of her late husband's indiscretions. Her worries over how to tell her children she is going away for the weekend with Mel is well written and very believable. One of the things I like best about this series is how well Churchill captures the aspects of family life especially Jane's struggles as a single parent and in dealing with her children, especially Katie, who is struggling with her hormones. There's a delightful scene in the book where Katie and Jane put their differences aside and work together to make clothespin dolls. Scenes like that are what makes this series so enjoyable. The mystery itself is well plotted, with plenty of suspects and I love the way Churchill gives Jane a legitimate reason for investigating the murder. As often happens in this series, the scene where the killer is revealed reads like something out of an Agatha Christie mystery. Finally, the very end of the book is sure to make readers smile."A Knife to Remember" is a great cozy mystery.

Leslie Sansone's "Walk Off Even More Weight" has two two-mile walks that you do using a weight belt, which comes with the DVD. The first walk is a Classic Walk - you move at a 15 minute per mile pace (4 mph). The second walk is a Fast Walk - you move at a 12 minute per mile pace (5 mph). Each workout gives you the option of doing just the first mile, just the second mile, or the full 2 miles. Also included on the DVD is a five-minute energy boost walk.Hosted by just Leslie with no other walkers, the Classic Walk features all the Leslie Sansone standards (warm-up, cool down and the four basic steps: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks and knee lifts). Since it is a two-mile walk she also adds a few more intense movements (especially in the second mile), including tap outs that turn to lunches and single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts. About seven minutes into the walk you put on the weight belt which you wear for the rest of the program, including the cool down. While the belt doesn't feel all that heavy while wearing it you can definitely feel it working especially after the workout is over and you take it off.The Fast Walk (again hosted just by Leslie) is an intense workout - you wear the weight belt from the very start until cool down. The moves are faster and more intense - for example, instead of walking back and forth you almost jog instead of walk. In addition to the four basic steps, you do things like walk, walk, walk, tap; power kicks (almost like hopping and kicking); tap outs that turn to lunches; single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts; heel down; and mini-squats. Leslie also adds a few things not usually done in her two-mile workouts -- notably a movement where you open up your feet and shift your weight from side to side (a lot of fun) and grapevines in place of double sidesteps - all of this helps add to the intensity of the workout.The Bonus Energy Boost Walk is a quick five minute fast walk. There is no warm up or cool down and you don't use the weight belt but it uses these typical Leslie moves: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks, knee lifts, walk forward and back, double knee lifts. Leslie also gives quick energy tips such as get plenty of sleep, make sure you eat breakfast, take a multivitamin etc."Walk Off Even More Weight" is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone exercise DVDs. While I found both routines to be beneficial I tend to use the Fast Walk the most because it is more intense and I feel like I've gotten a really good workout after using it. The weight belt adds just the right extra boost to make the workout feel even more intense. The workout may not be the best for beginners, but is more for those who are used to Leslie's workout (especially since she's not always good at telling you what move to do next, instead she simply moves into the next step). While I like the belt it takes a little getting used to when taking it on and off - especially taking it off during the Fast Walk when your hands may be sweaty. Also, the set Leslie uses can be a bit distracting - it is mostly mirrors and windows and you can see the cameraman in the mirrors."Walk Off Even More Weight" has two good two-mile walks that make for an excellent workout.

"The Five Little Peppers" are Ben, Polly, Joel, Davie, and Phronsie. Their father died when Phronsie was a baby and Mrs. Pepper struggles to earn enough money to support the family. Despite their poverty, they are a loving family, full of spirit and adventure. Ben and Polly do what they can to support the family, but a bout with measles threatens the well being of the entire Pepper clan, especially Joel and Polly. The family has other adventures and befriend Jasper King during one of them. This friendship will enrich their lives in ways they never thought would be possible.It's always interesting as an adult to reread a book that I loved as a child. When I was young I thought how much fun the Peppers had and longed to belong to a large family. As an adult, I realize how poor the family really was and how quickly the children had to grow up. As a child I thought how terrible it was that Polly couldn't read for days on end because of the measles; as an adult I realize the Peppers couldn't even afford to buy books.First published in 1881, "The Five Little Peppers and How They Grew" is old-fashioned (the doctor even makes house calls!), but still enjoyable. The Peppers are all delightful children, with Joel being the most honest of the bunch as he complains about having to eat the same food every day. Margaret Sidney was a talented author, who could make even inanimate objects, such as the stove, seem alive. The children's adventures may seem simple to today's young readers, who are used to Harry Potter and the like, but it's a refreshing change.

Designed for people who use walking as their main form of exercise, "The Essential Walker's Journal" has several parts. The first part explains how to use the journal. The second part asks users to write down their dreams. Next is a space to write down statistics such as weight, dress size, and cholesterol so that users can compare their stats before and after they start their exercise program. Next is a brief section on exercise, fitness, and nutrition. The next section is the journal itself, which is the largest section in the book. The journal is based on a four-month exercise program and there is a page for each day of the week, except for Sunday. Each page is full of useful information to be filled out, such as what you eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, how far you walked, how much water you drank, and how many hours you slept. There is also a section titled "A Beautiful Thing" where users can write something good that happened during the day and a space at the end titled "Notes" where users can write down anything they want. At the end of each month there is a progress report section. At the end of the book is a section titled "Four Month Wrap-Up" with a series of questions designed to help users realize how far they've come in their exercise program and help them plan future exercise programs. Interspersed throughout the book are several testimonials from people that have lost weight and improved their health through Leslie Sansone's walking programs.For the most part "The Essential Walker's Journal" was pretty useful. I like being able to track what I eat and drink each day, although there's not enough space to write it all down. It would be nice if I could keep track of how many calories I consume each day. Although the journal entries are dated Monday through Saturday, I ignore that and just put the date down. Since the journal is geared towards walkers, there's a section titled "Today's Walk" where you are supposed to right down how long you walked, but if I do some other type of exercise I make note of that in the space instead. Each day there is some tidbit at the top of the page: quotations, thoughts, diet information, that was fun to read. I also enjoyed the various profiles of people who lost weight through walking.Leslie Sansone fans (and fans of walking in general) should find this journal to be helpful although they may need to make some modifications.

Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners is meant to be an introduction to this form of yoga. The DVD has several menu options including an Introduction which explains Flow Yoga and the essence of the program; play the entire workout; a chapter index; a biography of Shiva Rea; and music options (you can choose to just have music or have music and instructions). The chapter index also has several options: Foundation Flow; Beginner's Backward Flow; Beginner's Flexibility Flow; Shavagena; and the closing credits.While it is labeled "beginners" and the box to the DVD says no yoga experience is necessary, this is a tough workout and I wouldn't recommend it for newcomers to yoga. It starts off slowly enough with a seated meditation that is meant to teach you how to link breath with movement, although it never really helped me get into the zone. After a few easy minutes, the yoga quickly became more difficult, although there are plenty of rest breaks built into the routine. Shiva Rea doesn't always explain what to do next, instead she just goes into the next move, which is frustrating for a beginner like me. It also broke the flow of yoga for me, as I constantly had to focus on the TV to see what she was doing instead of concentrating on the yoga. The DVD was filmed in Hawaii, a beautiful setting, but the camera sometimes focused too much on the scenery instead of the yoga. I also had a hard time positioning the yoga mat in order to see the TV, which made doing the yoga awkward.While the yoga seemed to be good, it was not for beginners as advertised and you need to be quite flexible to do it. I'm not very flexible and I was very sore afterwards.

In this second installment in Maddy Hunter's enjoyable Passport to Peril mystery series, Emily Andrews escorts a group of senior citizens from Iowa on a trip to Ireland. The trip starts out in typical madcap fashion as Emily lands in the water when her horse and buggy driver falls asleep after drinking too much. Emily's trip starts to get better when Etienne Micelli, whom she met in Switzerland, arrives to spend some quality time with her. If only she can keep him away from her ex-husband Jack, who is now a gorgeous woman named Jackie! Throw in a couple of dead bodies, a haunted hotel, food fights, and a bad case of hives and Emily is off on another hilarious adventure!I enjoyed this extremely funny mystery even more than I did the first one, Alpine for You. I especially like Emily's "Nana" who loves to take pictures of everything, no matter the situation. Hunter writes her speech in such a way that I can almost hear her accent as I read it. There are many funny scenes in the book to keep the reader laughing, including Emily's many attempts to be alone with Etienne and her "pajama party" with Jackie. The book is worth reading just for the dinner scene where everyone finds out who Jackie really is.Hunter doesn't let the humor get in the way of the mystery, however, and there are a few unexpected twists along the way to the solution.Highly recommended!

Written in diary style, Faithful is Stewart O'Nan and Stephen King's view of the 2004 Boston Red Sox season. O'Nan contributes the most to the book, especially at the beginning of the season, while Stephen King writes more about the middle and second half of the season. Their styles are quite different - O'Nan, who became a Red Sox fan as an adult, is more analytical about the game, yet at time is almost childlike in his attempts to catch balls at batting practice or get players autographs. King, a lifelong Red Sox fan, has experienced all the joy and heartbreak of being a member of Red Sox nation and it comes through in his writing. Some of his writing is memorable, especially the part where he throws out the first pitch, which had me laughing, and when he takes his mother-in-law to a playoff game, which brought tears to my eyes.As both a Red Sox and Stephen King fan, I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fun reliving certain games (including a few I'd like to forget about!). O'Nan and King not only talk about the games, but their own lives, in such a way that I felt like I was sitting next to them at Fenway Park, rather than reading a book!Red Sox fans will enjoy this book. After all, it has the perfect ending!

October 31st should have been the happiest day of Mortimer Brewster's life. Although he is famous for his books praising bachelorhood, he has just married Elaine Harper. But when he goes to tell his two elderly aunts the news, he discovers that his "sweet" aunts have been murdering elderly men by serving them elderberry wine laced with poison. His cousin Teddy, who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, has been burying the bodies, which he thinks belong to victims of yellow fever, in the basement, where he thinks he is digging locks for the Panama Canal. And as if that wasn't enough, Mortimer's brother Jonathan shows up at the house looking for a place to bury his latest murder victim.Arsenic and Old Lace is a wickedly funny screwball comedy. The script is witty and there are lots of sight gags. Funny scenes include Mortimer's discovery of one of his aunt's victims; the cab driver waiting patiently for Mortimer while stopping another cab to give someone a ride; many people almost drinking the poisoned wine; and policemen coming in and out of the house without a clue of the murderous happenings going on around them.The actors nail their parts. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair are great as the seemingly sweet, slightly befuddled aunts. John Alexander is perfect as Teddy. Peter Lorre is funny as Dr. Einstein, Jonathan's assistant and Raymond Massey is appropriately chilling as Jonathan. As Elaine Harper, Priscilla Lane doesn't have much to do, but she looks very pretty doing it. I've read that Cary Grant thought he overacted as Mortimer, but he's perfect in the role. One of his best scenes is when he is tied up and gagged and must act through body language. Perfection.I've seen Arsenic and Old Lace many times and laugh and enjoy it each time. I love this movie and recommend it to fans of screwball comedy.

Romance novelist Melanie Joan Hall hires Sunny Randall to protect her from her stalker ex-husband. Melanie met John Melvin, a psychiatrist, when she started going to him for counseling and he seduced her. As she investigates Melvin, Sunny realizes that Melanie is not the only patient he has seduced. When two of his patients die, Sunny realizes that Melvin needs to be stopped before someone else gets hurt. To catch him, Sunny becomes his patient, but in trying to stop Melvin, Sunny places herself in great danger, danger she may not escape from."Shrink Rap" is a quick, but at times tense read. Sunny Randall is a more complex character than Robert Parker's Spenser is, struggling with her feelings for her ex-husband. Melanie Joan is also a complex character - a successful writer, beloved by her fans, but haunted by her ex-husband. John Melvin is pure evil, without any redeeming characteristics. As always, the dialogue and the use of Boston itself as a character in the novel drive the story. While much of the novel is intense, especially in the scenes where Melvin stalks Melanie Joan, the ending is especially intense as Sunny takes an incredible risk in trying to catch Melvin.Nicely done.

This made-for-tv movie is based on a real life incident in 2002, when nine Pennsylvania coal miners were trapped for three days when water flooded their mine. Partially shot at the Quecreek mine, where the accident happened, this movie is a realistic look at what the miners had to do to survive, as well as what their families went through while waiting for the miners to be rescued.At just 90 minutes long, this is a fast paced and thrilling movie. The miners and their families are introduced in quick segments at the beginning of the movie and then the film moves right into the mine flooding and the miners struggle to say alive. The film alternates scenes in the mine with scenes of the miners families waiting at the fire hall for news of their loved ones.The filmmakers do a good job filming the scenes with the trapped miners to the point where I felt claustrophobic watching some of the mine scenes. Even though I knew the miners all got out safely, I was on the edge of my seat watching them struggle in the water. The scenes with the families are, with one or two exceptions, emotional without being cloying.I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to fans of movies based on real-life events.

When caterer Goldy Schulz is attacked and her food deliberately spoiled while catering a funeral lunch, she suspects her attacker was her ex-husband, Dr. John Richard Korman, who was recently released from jail. While Goldy is concerned that someone is trying to sabotage her business, she is also worried about her husband, Tom, who has been depressed ever since he lost a case and a guilty defendant was let free. And then there is health inspector Roger Mannis who is making Goldy's life very difficult by doing his best to find health violations while she is catering. Goldy soon has bigger worries when she discovers the body of someone who was murdered and she becomes the chief suspect when the police think her gun was used in the murder. Goldy realizes she is being framed and tries to figure out who the real murderer is from a long list of suspects. While she is trying to save her business and investigate the murder, Goldy is dealing with problems with her son, Arch. Not only does he blame her for the murder, but it's clear he's keeping secrets from her. Goldy certainly has a lot on her plate."Double Shot" is a well done mystery. The murder in the book takes the series in a direction that could have hurt the series but instead makes it stronger. The book has some memorable characters, including Sandee, John Korman's latest girlfriend, and Brewster Motley, the attorney defending Goldy, who looks more like a surfer than an attorney. Author Diane Mott Davidson works the catering aspects seamlessly into the story and I liked the fact that Goldy's cooking isn't always perfect. The fact that she burns some fruit pies makes her more of a real character. The mystery itself is well plotted, with plenty of suspects. The motive for the murder is a sad one and readers may sympathize more with the murderer than the victim. Most of the plot lines are neatly wrapped up at the end and things that I didn't think were related to the plot, like out of control forest fires, actually turn out to be very important rather than mere filler. One of the plot lines is deliberately left vague, which may frustrate some readers, but I liked it. However, there were a couple of things I didn't like about the book. I found it hard to believe that Goldy didn't lose any of her customers while a murder suspect. And at the end of the book, Goldy has a new enemy who no doubt will be featured in future books. It would be nice if Goldy had some personal peace in at least one book, but that's probably not going to happen."Double Shot" is a good mystery.

In this mystery set in Victorian England, Inspector Gerald Witherspoon is in charge of the investigation of the murder of Sir Edmund Leggett, who was killed on his way home from his engagement party. Witherspoon has plenty of suspects, beginning with a young woman who has been stalking him. But there's plenty of other people that wanted him dead, including his fianc&eacute;e who hates him (he was marrying her for her money, her parents agreed because they wanted his title), his mistress who is furious at the upcoming wedding, his cousin who inherits everything, and the numerous people he owes money to. But Witherspoon will have no problem solving this case, not while his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of his household staff are working behind the scenes to help him!I really enjoy this series. The mysteries are always well written and well plotted. Brightwell switches back and forth between Witherspoon's investigation and the servants which I like, because it gives insight into all the characters. What I like the most is that, even after nineteen books in the series, the characters continue to grow and in each book we learn more and more about them. In this particular book, it was a little tidbit about Hatchet that made him come even more alive to me as a character. And Witherspoon's detecting abilities develop more and more each book, which is a nice touch as it would have been easy for him to become a caricature.I highly recommend these books for fans of cozy mysteries. My only complaint is I read the book in one night and now have to wait for the next one!

This touching film is the story of the relationship between Helen Keller and her beloved "Teacher", Anne Sullivan. When Anne arrived at Helen's house, Helen, who was blind and deaf from an illness she had as a baby, is a wild child, spoiled rotten by her parents. Anne, newly graduated from The Perkins School for the Blind, is struggling with her own demons - surgery restored her eyesight, but her eyes are very sensitive, and she is haunted by the death of her brother, Jimmy. The first thing she does is finger spell words to Helen, showing her a doll and spelling the word "doll" out in sign language, even though she knows that Helen will not understand what she is trying to do. In one grueling scene, Anne also tries to teach Helen table manners, finally getting her to fold her own napkin. She finally convinces Helen's family to let her go away with Helen for two weeks to teach her discipline. The experiment is a huge success. The experiment is a huge success, but Anne is discouraged that Helen still hasn't grasped the concept of the meaning of words. She thinks it will take a miracle to reach Helen."The Miracle Worker" was a play before it was a movie and at times this movie comes across as a filmed play. This is a bit confining, but it works well in some scenes like when Anne and Helen stay in the cabin by themselves and especially the intense scene where Anne tries to teach Helen to eat from her own plate and not take food from other people's plates. The acting is terrific, both Anne Bancroft as Anne and Patty Duke as Helen deservedly won Oscars for their work. Although a bit old for the part, Duke is especially brilliant, viewers will really believe she is blind and deaf.There are no extras on this DVD. I found it astonishing that, although there were subtitles in French and Spanish, there were no English subtitles. It's unbelievable that a large number of hearing impaired viewers will not be able to watch this inspiring film.

Angel Stark makes an appearance at Penelope Thornton McClure's bookstore to promote her true crime novel "All My Pretty Friends". Not everyone is happy about Angel's book, which is about the murder of a debutante, Bethany Banks, including the victim's sister who interrupts Angels' speech. Someone then tries to run Angel over and shortly after that she disappears. Pen, along with the ghost of Jack Shepard, a private eye who was murdered over fifty years ago, are investigating angel's disappearance when Pen stumbles over a body that turns out to be that of Bethany's sister. Is there a serial killer on the loose?I love this mystery series. The relationship between Jack Shepard, the ghost of a hard-boiled detective and Penelope, a modern day widow, are what makes the book work. Alice Kimberly deftly weaves one of Jack's old cases with the modern one, writing Jack's case using the jargon of hard-boiled detective literature and Pen's case in modern day language. It's particularly amusing as Jack explains the jargon used in his time and Pen tells him about modern day conveniences such as cell phones and who people such as John F. Kennedy, Jr. were. Readers will chuckle, perhaps uneasily, as Jack wonders why anyone would buy bottled water. Not too many authors could write believably about the attraction between a live person and a ghost, but Kimberly does it beautifully.The mystery itself is reminiscent of the Kennedy-Skakel case with plenty of suspects and twists and turns. The identity of the murderer will come as a surprise to many readers but is believable. Kimberly throws in a nice way of Jack being able to leave the bookstore to help solve the mystery, which is great, because it allows the characters to interact and sole mysteries in several locations rather than be confined to the bookstore.I highly recommend this book and the entire series.

In this mystery, set in the small town of Sitting Marsh in England during World War II, residents are not happy when a munitions factory is built near the town. So unhappy, in fact, that Douglas McNally, manager of the plant, shows Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton some threatening letters he has received. When McNally and a cleaning woman are found dead after a fire at the factory, the Fire Marshall rules the fire an accident, which satisfies the police, but Elizabeth isn't convinced, especially when she hears the victims bodies were found inside a locked office. She decides to investigate the deaths herself, but unless she's careful, things might get too hot for her!This is another delightful cozy mystery in Kate Kingsbury's Manor House series. The mystery itself is slight, there aren't that many suspects and it's pretty obvious who the murderer is. But I read the mysteries more for the characters and what is going on in their lives. Elizabeth is a good strong heroine, although a little too full of her "position" in the village at times. Fans of the series will be glad to hear that Earl is back, but you'll have to read the book to find out how and why! Violet and Martin, are a bit of a clich&eacute; as the faithful household retainers, but Kingsbury writes them in such a way that you care for them and actually hold your breath when Martin walks down the stairs, hoping he'll make it. And Martin is involved in some of the most humorous moments in the book, making a reader wonder if he is as dotty as he sometimes seems to be. Housemaids Sadie and Polly show what life was like for young girls in war torn England.This is a good book for fans of cozy, humorous mysteries.

Mortally wounded in a car accident, Hatch Harrison is brought back to life by Dr. Jonas Nyebern. Despite being dead for 80 minutes, initially Hatch seems to have no ill effects from the accident and he and his wife Lindsay decide to take advantage of the extra chance at life and adopt a 10 year old handicapped girl named Regina. But Hatch is beginning to realize that everything isn't okay as he starts having strange visions of another man and unexplained moments of rage. Hatch soon realizes that he is somehow psychically linked with a serial killer that is killing people that Hatch knows. Now the killer is after Hatch's family and he's in the fight of his life as he battles to save his family."Hideaway" is an eerily effective novel about good vs. evil. Vassago, the serial killer, is one of the creepiest villains I've ever read about. His method of killings his victims and what he does with the bodies afterwards are chilling and gory, although Dean Koontz wisely doesn't go into graphic detail, letter readers use their own imagination. Lindsay and Hatch are likable protagonists, but it is plucky Regina who steals the novel and gives much needed humor and lightness to an otherwise dark story. She's a wonderful, likeable character and readers will route for her throughout the novel.Koontz has a nice way with language, such as when he describes Regina going into her own "hideaway", yet at other times he overdoes it. He fills the book with imagery of spiders and the reader soon realizes that the Harrison's are caught in a web of terror. That's clever, but Koontz, either underestimating the intelligence of his readers or feeling a need to show how clever he is, explains to the readers what they've already figured out. He's a good writer and he should let the writing speak for itself. And the ending of the novel is thrilling except for the unfortunate description of how Hatch descends to the bottom of an elevator shaft. It was unintentionally hilarious and pulled me away from the tenseness of the moment.Despite these flaws, I still recommend this chilling novel.

Cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman opens a yarn shop on Blossom Street. In order to attract customers, she decides to hold knitting classes, with a baby blanket being the first project. Three people sign up, all with different reasons for being there. Unhappily married Jacqueline Donovan dislikes her new pregnant daughter-in-law, Tammie Lee, but decides to knit the baby blanket to show her son she is making an effort to accept his new wife. Carol Girard desperately wants a baby, but has been unable to conceive and is about to undergo her third and final IVF procedure. When she sees the sign for knitting a baby blanket, she takes it as a good omen and joins the class. Alix Townsend had a rough upbringing, has had a bit of trouble with the law, and is living from paycheck to paycheck. Although she can barely afford it, she decides to sign up for the knitting classes because she can donate the blanket to charity and use it against her court ordered community service hours. Lydia is a bit concerned that these totally different women won't get along, but they all become close in ways none of them imagined."The Shop on Blossom Street" was a funny, but light read, what I call cotton candy for the brain. Of the four characters I liked Lydia and Alix the best. Lydia's troubled relationship with her sister and the affect the cancer has had on her life, especially in her relationships, were interesting. The story of Alix's troubled childhood makes her a sympathetic character and readers will want her to succeed in her relationship with youth minister Jordan Turner. Carol's struggle to have a child is heartbreaking, although I found her character to be a bit bland. I found Jacqueline to be a stereotypical rich, shallow person at first, concerned only with her standing in society, but her character grew on me by the end of the book.Debbie Macomber's story telling ability is her strong point. She creates characters that you care about and readers will eagerly turn the pages to find out what happens to them. Unfortunately at times she resorts to cliched characters like Jacqueline, which is a shame when the other three characters are so believable and likable. Some of the plots in this book are also cliched and one particular plot, involving Alix and her roommate, was too convenient and totally unbelievable."The Shop on Blossom Street" is a nice but fluffy read.

As I approach Perimenopause, I've been reading as many books as I can on the subject so I know what's going to happen and what I can do to relieve the symptoms. This book has been a great help. It explains what will happen and why it is happening. There's a handy list of symptoms of Perimenopause and solutions to these symptoms. There's a list of what routine checkups a woman should have at certain ages. Hormone Replacement Therapy is discussed as well as natural remedies for those who don't want to go the HRT route. The book also has chapters on the four major diseases women face as they age and how they can help prevent the diseases through weight control, diet, and exercise. Fertility and Infertility is discussed at length as is sexuality and Menopause. There's a chapter on how to find the right doctor and a very helpful chapter with examples of what some women went through during Menopause.This was a very informative book. I can't say I'm looking forward to Perimenopause, but at least now I know what's going to happen. There were many charts that I found helpful, especially the ones showing the risk factors for Breast Cancer, Alzheimer's, Heart Disease and Osteoporosis. Scary stuff but good to know. The list of symptoms of Perimenopause was also helpful.The one qualm I have about this book is that it was written in 1999 and discusses HRT as being more risk free than recent studies have shown. The authors have already revised the book once and I'm hoping they put out a third edition discussing the study results.

When Air Force One, carrying President James Marshall and his family, is taken over by terrorists, the President makes it to the escape pod on the plane, but he refuses to leave while his family is still on board. With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?Okay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.This is a good action adventure film.

This movie is Hollywood's take on Lemony Snicket's series of darkly comic novels about the adventures of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents died in a fire. Based on the first three books in the series, the movie does a lot of things right, starting with Jude Law as Lemony Snicket, in silhouette only, narrating the movie much like Snicket narrates the books. Because it's based on three books, the storylines are condensed, but it works and the film moves right along. Fans of the books will love the inclusion of The Happy Little Elf. Things the movie doesn't do right is not having Klaus wear glasses (maybe the producers thought he would look too much like Harry Potter?) and Mr. Poe does not continually cough. The film uses subtitles to translate Sunny's speech, which is mildly amusing, but doesn't quite capture her speech the way the books do.Parts of this movie can be upsetting for younger children, starting of course, with the death of the Baudelaire parents (not seen on camera). An especially scary scene is when Count Olaf parks his car on a railroad track and locks the car so that the children are trapped in the car as a train is coming. I didn't like the scene when Count Olaf tried to force Violet to marry him in the books and I wish it hadn't been included in the movie. Young viewers might not get the implications, but the whole idea made me uncomfortable.The acting in this movie is quite good. The child actors, Emily Browning as Violet; Liam Aiken as Klaus; and twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman all do well in their roles. Billy Connolly is fine as Uncle Monty and Meryl Streep is great as Aunt Josephine who is afraid of everything (with good reason as it turns out). As for Jim Carrey, yes his acting is way over the top as Count Olaf; but then again Count Olaf's character is way over the top in the books.Fans of the quirky Snicket books should enjoy this darkly humorous movie. The books are better, but the movie does it's best to capture the black humor of the novels and mostly succeeds. A good movie to rent.

Jane Jeffry's mother Cecily is in town on a visit and she and Jane sign up for a writing class at the local community center. Cecily has traveled all over the world and thinks the class on writing autobiographies is a good way of preserving her memories. Jane and her friend Shelley Nowack are taking the class to keep Cecily company, but Jane soon discovers she may have a talent for writing. Jane's enjoying the class, although she wishes the obnoxious Agnes Pryce hadn't signed up as well. Jane's not the only one who doesn't like Mrs. Pryce and when she demands that the entire class attend a pot luck dinner at her house, someone takes the opportunity to poison Mrs. Pryce's quiche during that dinner. Even though the police, including Jane's friend Detective Mel Van Dyne, are investigating the murder, Jane does a little snooping of her own, since someone used the quiche that Jane made to poison Mrs. Pryce. When someone starts leaving Jane a series of clues, she realizes who the murderer is and that the truth isn't always easy to handle."A Quiche Before Dying" is another delightful entry in Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry cozy mystery series. In this, the third book in the series, Jane is really developing as a character, as she is leaving the memory of her late husband behind and coming into her own as a person. The little tidbits about the writing class and Jane's discovery that she may have the talent to be a writer are a fascinating glimpse into the world of writing. Two of Jane's children, Mike and Todd, are away for most of the book, but Jane's interactions with her daughter Katie add to the realism in the book. And it was nice to meet Jane's mother Cecily, who added yet another dimension to Jane's character. I also loved the way the romance between Jane and Mel is developing. Jane's writing classmates and teacher are all well written and great suspects: teacher Missy who writes romance novels; the affable Grady Wells; sisters Ruth Rogers and Naomi Smith; the offbeat Desiree Loftus; and ex-military man Bob Neufield. The mystery elements are well written and well plotted and with so many suspects readers will have fun trying to figure out who the killer is. Churchill has a tendency for Agatha Christie like scenes in her books when the murderer is revealed, which can be a bit unbelievable, but in this case it does add some poignancy to the end of this book."A Quiche Before Dying" is a nicely done cozy mystery.

The premise of "Mystery Case Files: Huntsville" is a simple one - there is a crime spree in Huntsville that is baffling police and players need to find hidden objects to solve the crimes. Once enough objects are found in a round, the players have to solve a puzzle that identifies the criminal and they move on to the next round. There are 16 crimes to solve (including the final one in Big Boss's secret hideout); dozens of locations (including Alice's Diner, a Bookstore, Ivan's Caf&eacute;, Pete's Pawnshop, and the Art Museum); and dozens of objects to find like paper clips, marbles, bats, clocks, playing cards, coins and dice. Each level is timed so you have to find the objects before time runs out."Mystery Case Files: Huntsville" is the first hidden object game in the Mystery Case Files series, in my opinion the best hidden object series. The games starts off easily enough with two locations, 16 clues to find (8 in each location), and 20 minutes to find them all, and gets progressively harder as the game goes along until the final round which gives you only four minutes to find the objects and solve the puzzle. If you are new to the series, you may find you run of time in the beginning before finding al the objects, but that's okay because you can start over again with different objects to find. Don't click too fast when looking for objects or you'll lose time. Some of the objects are out in the open and easy to find while others are well hidden. If you find yourself stuck, leave the location and go to another one, you'll find objects are easier to find the next time you return to that location. Some of the clues are a bit tricky, for example if you need to find a bat, you could be looking for either a baseball bat or the mammal. Each level has three hints that can be used to either find an object or move a puzzle piece. Make sure you use the hints wisely - sometime you need to find more than one object (like three stamps) and the hint will only show one of these items, not all three.Since this is the first Mystery Case Files game, it's not as complex as some of the later games in the series (like Madame Fate) and is perfect for people new to the Hidden Objects games. Since some of the locations are repeated throughout the game, you'll be able to locate clues quicker in those locations as the game progresses. It doesn't take a long time to play, maybe five or six hours total, but it can be played over and over again since you need to find different items every time you play. Although this is a single player game, others can sign on in another name and play separately without losing the place you are in. The final level, Big Boss's Hideout, is the most frustrating level since there is only four minutes to solve the whole thing."Mystery Case Files: Huntsville" is hours of puzzling fun.

It's almost Christmas and Stephanie Plum isn't ready for the holiday. She doesn't have a tree and she hasn't bought any presents. She also has work to do as a bounty hunter; she has to find toy maker Sandy Claws who has skipped bail. The last thing she needs is complications but that's just what happens when sexy stranger Diesel literally appears out of nowhere in her kitchen. Diesel is vague as to where he came from and how he managed to pop into Stephanie's apartment, but he's a man on a mission and sticks by Stephanie's side until he figures out what that mission is. When Stephanie isn't preoccupied with Diesel and trying to catch Sandy Claws, she's dealing with family issues. Her niece Mary Alice doesn't believe in Santa, her sister Valerie has startling news, and her Grandma Mazur has a new stud muffin. At this point, Stephanie wonders if she'll ever get a Christmas tree and her Christmas shopping done!"Visions of Sugar Plums" is a fun, if light read. Most of the old familiar characters are included: Joe Morelli, Stephanie's parents, Grandma Mazur, Valerie and her daughters, and Albert Kloughn. However, fans may be disappointed that there's no Ranger in the book. Lula doesn't appear until near the end of the book, but has some very funny scenes, especially when she "finds" a parking spot at the mall. Diesel adds a bit of fantasy that's a nice touch in a book that takes place in a season that's often filled with fantasy. Everyone, including Stephanie, accepts Diesel's sudden appearance. To me that was the only of-note, especially the way Morelli quickly decides that Diesel isn't a threat to his relationship with Stephanie. I groaned a bit when Stephanie was looking for someone named Sandy Claws at Christmas time since I thought that was overly clever but I changed my mind as the story started rolling along. Sandy Claws and his "elf" helpers added much humor to the book. In fact, the book is full of humorous incidents ranging from a food fight to Stephanie buying a Christmas tree (over and over again), the elves, and, of course, Stephanie's car being blown up. The book is worth reading just for the extremely funny take on the poem "`Twas the Night Before Christmas". While the book is long on humor and a bit short on plot, the resolution of the plot line with Grandma Mazur's stud muffin is quite a surprise and well done."Visions of Sugar Plums" is a light but very funny book to read.

The heroine of these books is Stephanie Plum, an inept bounty hunter from Jersey employed by her cousin Vinnie. In this book Vinnie branches out to include visa bonds in his bail bonds business. As soon as he issues one, the person in question skips out on the bond, and it's up to Stephanie and Ranger to track him down.Some of the funniest scenes in the book take place when the search takes Stephanie, Lula, and Connie to Las Vegas. Lula is on a diet in order to become a super model and her scenes made me laugh out loud.Not much of Stephanie's family in this one and I would have liked more of Grandma Mazur, but there was more of Morelli's family and his Grandma Bella's visions about Stephanie added a lot to the book.A nice touch in this book is that Stephanie's car makes it through the book unscathed, but the same can't be said of the bodyguards Ranger assigns to her.The book isn't all fun and games though. What starts off as a simple hunt for a skipped visa bond evolves into a cat and mouse game between Stephanie and an unknown assailant determined to harm her.If you like mysteries with a lot of action and a lot of laughs, this is the series for you!

In this witty comedy, two struggling musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and need to get out of town fast. They dress up as women and join an all-women band headed for Florida. Along the way, Joe courts Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), and a millionaire courts Jerry.This film has a little bit of everything in it, murder, romance, and humor, lots of lots of humor. The dialogue is sharp and the acting is excellent. Marilyn Monroe is perfect as Sugar Kane, Tony Curtis' Cary Grant impression is one of the funniest bits in the movie and Jack Lemmon is also perfect. Joe E. Brown, as Lemmon's would be suitor almost steals the movie and gets to deliver the last line, one of the funniest lines in the movie.I recommend this movie to those who like a good laugh.

13 year old Jenna longs to be part of the popular crowd in high school. She invites them to her birthday party, but things don't go as she plans and she wishes she was 30. With the help of some "magic dust", she wakes up to find her wish is granted. But Jenna soon discovers that being 30 isn't any easier than being 13 as she struggles with work problems, relationship problems, and the realization that, as an adult, she isn't a very likeable person.This is a really enjoyable romantic comedy. Jennifer Garner is perfect as the "adult" Jenna and proves herself to be a gifted comedienne, especially in the early scenes of Jenna realizing she is an adult. She seems to be having a lot of fun with the role and is very convincing as a 13 year old "adult". Mark Ruffalo is equally as good as her best friend, Mattie, and Judy Greer and Andy Serkis are good in supporting roles.This is one of the funniest movies of this type that I've seen. It's not the type of movie you want to think too much about, but a perfect movie to watch on a lazy afternoon.

On November 28, 1942, Boston's Cocoanut Grove nightclub caught on fire. Trapped by flames and deadly fumes, 492 people died in what was ultimately the worst nightclub fire in United States history. "Fire In The Grove" details the events of not only the fire, but the events leading up to it: shoddy construction; the use of flammable materials; overcrowding; blocked exits; the employment of minors; and the willingness of public officials to overlook the violations. The book also covers the stories of the victims and survivors; some survivors were forced to leave loved ones behind as they fled the fire. Treatment of burn victims is also described; doctors tried new treatments on the burns, which eventually revolutionized how burn victims are treated. The book also covers the trial of the owner of the Cocoanut Grove; readers will no doubt be outraged at how all involved basically got away with little penalty. Finally, the book covers the 2003 fire at The Station nightclub in Rhode Island where 100 people died in eerily similar circumstances."Fire In The Grove" is an extremely well written and touching book. Having grown up in the Boston area, I had heard about the fire which happened before I was born, but not until I read the book did I realize the full extent of the tragedy. The survivor's stories, especially those that had to leave behind loved ones are especially moving. The book also gives a clear picture of what politics in Boston were like at that time and what the nightclub life was like. There are plenty of pictures, including a diagram of the Cocoanut Grove, showing what a firetrap it really was. The picture of the truckload of caskets shows the enormity of the death toll and is hard to take."Fire In The Grove' is well worth reading.

Betsy-Tacy is the first book in the delightful series by Maud Hart Lovelace. Five-year-old Betsy longs for a best friend and finds one when Tacy moves in across the street. Together they have many adventures, including going on picnics, selling sand, playing with paper dolls, going "calling" on neighbors, climbing The Big Hill, and going to school for the first time.The Betsy-Tacy books were partially autobiographical and Lovelace perfectly captures the innocence and magic of childhood. Betsy's imaginative stories, such as riding a feather, are delightful. Even though they are children, Betsy and Tacy's lives are, as in real life, not always happy. The death of Tacy's baby sister, left tears in my eyes yet joy at the innocence of youth as Betsy and Tacy leave an Easter Egg in a tree with the belief that a bird will carry it up to Heaven and give it to Tacy's sister.I loved these books as a child and I'm happy to say I still love them as an adult. This is a great book for young and old.

Based on her autobiography, Child Star tells the story of the fame of Shirley Temple, perhaps the most loved child star of all time. The movie does a good job of setting the time period, the depression by using newsreel footage and radio broadcasts. Many of her most famous routines are faithfully recreated, sometimes as clips from the movies, other times as if they were filming the movie.The acting is good. Ashley Rose Orr "sparkles" as Shirley (Shirley's mother always told her to "sparkle"). It's tough recreating a living legend, but she can sing and dance and act quite well, although she did say "Oh, my goodness" a bit too many times. Connie Britton is good as Shirley's mother, although Colin Friel is bland as her father. A standout is Hinton Battle as Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.Shirley Temple fans will enjoy this movie. She's one of those rare child stars who seems well-adjusted, so there's nothing really controversial in the film. Anything that is controversial, such as Shirley's father spending almost all her money, is sugar-coated, perhaps because Shirley was a consultant on the movie. Unfortunately, the movie veers off course in the end by showing Shirley as a teenager. A much better ending would have been her leaving the 20th Century Fox studios when they terminated her contract.DVD extras include an audio commentary by Melissa Joan Hart, who produced the movie along with her mother, and an interesting feature on the making of the movie.

In this disappointing entry in a usually reliable series, Jane Jeffrey has finished writing a novel and is hoping to get it published, so she and her friend Shelley Nowack attend a mystery writer's convention, and, before they know it they are investigating the poisoning of an agent, an attack on a reviewer, and a case of plagiarism.Among other things, this book lacks continuity. In past books in this series, Jane is portrayed as being quite frugal, not willing to part with her ancient station wagon, even though it is falling apart. All of a sudden, Jane has a completely different attitude, not only willing to buy a new jeep, but have the pothole in her driveway repaired, and buys cell phones for herself and two of her children. Her decision to buy the jeep would have worked much better if it was developed throughout the course of the book and she bought the jeep at the end of the book.Newcomers to the series will wonder how Jane, a single mother, with no apparent job, has so much money. Churchill has always explained this, and what happened to Jane's husband, in a few simple sentences in past books, and should have done it her. Jane's decision to leave her two youngest children home alone, although they are old enough to be left alone, was a decision she would have agonized about in past books and it came too easily in this one.I did enjoy the parts about the convention, reading it, I felt like I was there. But the book felt thrown together, as if Churchill was meeting a deadline. More time should have been spent developing the characters, several of which, particularly Vernetta are written so broadly that they are unbelievable. The mystery itself is practically non-existent; the book is more about the convention than the two attacks, neither of which is fatal.The Jane Jeffrey mysteries are usually quite good. Newcomers to the series should not let one weak entry keep them from reading the rest of the series.

Heartbroken after her husband falls in love with her sister, who is now pregnant with his child, Joy Candellaro impulsively decides to leave town right before Christmas and hops on a plane to Canada to get away. But her plane crashes and Joy wanders away only to end up at a fishing lodge owned by Daniel O'Shea, who has a young son, Bobby. Joy immediately bonds with Bobby who is still dealing with his mother's tragic death. She doesn't bond as easily with Daniel who has problems of his own - he was divorced from Bobby's mother and is struggling to establish a relationship with his young son. But just when Joy thinks she might be falling in love with Daniel, she is pulled away from them and has to fight her way back. While trying to do so, she begins to realize that things aren't what they seem and she begins to question what is and what isn't real. But in her heart, she knows she needs to find Daniel and Bobby before she'll be whole again."Comfort and Joy" is a unique type or romance and while it doesn't quite work in the end, Kristen Hannah deserves a lot of credit for attempting it. Joy is a believable heroine, devastated and needing to get away after the betrayal of her husband and sister. Bobby is very cute and very real, prone to having imaginary friends and seeing his dead mother, he very much needs loving parents. Unfortunately, not only because the book is from Joy's viewpoint but because of the whole premise of the book, Daniel is never a fully developed character and the romance between him and Joy never really worked for me. The book is divided into two parts and the second section goes in a totally different, Sixth Sense type of direction that may take readers off guard. It wasn't until I reread certain parts of the book that I realized how cleverly Hannah devised certain plot lines (like the way Joy was able to play games with Bobby and Daniel and a phone call she made) and how she placed little hints as to what was going on. Again, it ultimately didn't work, but it was a good attempt and well done.

"Total Body Turn Around" with Kathy Smith features three different 20 minute workouts that target a physical change people face as they grow olderTotal Circuit:You need a mat, chair, and hand weights for this exercise which features interval training. Smith incorporates a lot of aerobic work in this one - march in place; heel digs; side steps (eventually adding jumps); knee lifts; squats; and push ups. The exercises using hand weights include putting one hand on a chair while lifting weights with the other hand; bicep curls; shoulder press; one leg dead lift; triceps extensions; and more. This was a very difficult workout for me to do - I'd say it was for advanced exercisers. Also, I didn't quite have enough room for all the equipment I needed. It's an intense workout - a bit too intense for me.Total Balance:This exercise segment starts energetically right away with sidesteps and lots of arm movements. Smith is in bare feet and I prefer doing this segment the same way. The balancing part starts very quickly - Smith does a good job of smoothly incorporating the balancing with the aerobics. Among the many moves she does are squats; grapevine; lifting the leg after sidesteps; plie squats; knee lifts; double squats; and some yoga positions. While I did occasionally have some problems balancing (I exercise in my bedroom so I grabbed onto my bed for balance) I found this to be a very effective routine. Of the three segments on this DVD Total Balance is the one I'll do the most. My one complaint is that Smith is a little too enthusiastic and needs to tone down her "whooping".Total Energy:This exercise routine is done barefoot using a mat. It is the slowest paced of the three. There is a lot of emphasis on breathing and stretching. Smith uses a lot of yoga poses in this one: chair pose; rag doll pose; child's pose etc. There are also some toning poses like rib circles; leg circles; rollup and down like a ball. It is a nice leisurely workout that focuses on every part of your body by the time it is over. It wasn't my favorite routine in this DVD - it is a bit too slow and I didn't feel like I had even exercised by the time it was done. Still, I do like the concept of shooting energy through my hands - I've taken to doing that move during a long tiring workday.Bottom-line:"Total Body Turn Around" offers a bit of something for everyone. Kathy Smith has a lot of energy for her age (she really does need to tone down the whooping). She offers lots of modifications for each move which is good for those of us who aren't as flexible or as athletic as she is. In the end I prefer Leslie Sansone's DVDs and I'll probably only pop this one in whenever I need to work on my balance.

When a bullet-ridden body is found hanging from a tree in a public park in Paradise, Massachusetts, Police Chief Jesse Stone is called in to investigate the death. When he finds out the body is that of controversial talk show host Walter Weeks and that there was a second murder of someone close to Weeks, Jesse wants to solve the case quickly before the national media gets too much involved. He is also trying to help his ex-wife, Jenn, who claims she was raped. Jesse has plenty of suspects in the Weeks case and as he struggles to untangle the messy case he is also trying to untangle the messy relationship he has with Jenn and wonders just what his relationship with Sunny Randall is.Although I usually enjoy reading Robert Parker's books, "High Profile" just didn't do it for me. All of his usual elements are in the book - his pitch perfect depiction of Boston and a story driven mostly by witty dialogue (if only I could think up comebacks as quickly as each character in the book does). The mystery aspects are okay - the plot of who killed the victims and why is interesting but not developed enough. Instead, most of the book is about Jesse and his complicated relationship not only with his ex-wife Jenn but Sunny Randall. Jesse spends way too much time dwelling over his relationship with Jenn and far too little time investigating the case. This might have been forgivable except for the fact that Jenn is one of the most unlikable characters I've come across in a book and it is hard to understand why Jesse is continually drawn to her. Sunny's character isn't much better as she is involved in a similarly conflicted relationship with her ex-husband Richie. Finally, when Parker does get back to the mystery of Weeks murder, while there are some nice plot twists, the scene where Jesse confronts the murderer ends in a totally unbelievable way."High Profile" is not one of Robert Parker's better books.

Sister Mary Helen is surprised to find out that she is one of ten winners of a trip to the shrine of St. James in Santiago Spain - she didn't know her good friend Sister Eileen had entered her name in the contest. At the urging of restaurant owner Senior Carlos Fraga de la Cueva, who would like her to keep an eye on his wayward nephew Pepe, Sister Mary Helen agrees to go to Spain with Sister Eileen. This is supposed to be a nice little getaway, but murder has a way of finding Sister Mary Helen and it's not long before she stumbles across the dead body of someone in their tour group. Her police friends in the United States, Dennis Gallagher and Kate Murphy, urge Sister Mary Helen to let the local police, headed by Comisario Serrano, do all the investigating and Sister Mary Helen be content with sightseeing. But Sister Mary Helen can't help being involved and soon there are several attempts on her life. Comisario Serrano, with the aid of several phone calls to Kate Murphy, scrambles frantically to solve the murder before Sister Mary Helen is fatally hurt.I always enjoy reading Sister Carol Anne O'Marie's cozy mystery series featuring Sister Mary Helen and "Murder Takes a Pilgrimage" is no exception. Gray haired Sister Mary Helen is a delightful character who loves to read murder mysteries that she hides behind plastic prayer book covers so she doesn't shock others with her choice of reading material and she has an unfortunate habit of getting involved in real life mysteries. Sister Eileen is also a delight; especially with her habit of quoting what she claims are sayings back home in Ireland, although Sister Mary Helen suspects she makes them up as she goes along. Since much of the action in the book takes place in Spain, we don't see as much of Kate Murphy and especially Dennis Gallagher, which is a shame. But the few glimpses we get of Kate and her agonizing about whether or not to go back to work after the birth of her son are well done and add a lot of the book. While I did miss the absence of the other nuns, especially Sister Anne, throughout much of the book, characters like Maria Jose add some nice bits to the book. The mystery itself is well plotted and it was fun to try to figure out who the murderer was. The book isn't without flaws - it's obvious who will be murdered; readers will figure out why someone is trying to steal Sister Mary Helen's purse long before she and the police do; and the final scene where the murderer is revealed seems intended to be sad but was unbelievable to me. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise very enjoyable mystery."Murder Takes a Pilgrimage" is a delightful cozy mystery.

When seventeen-year-old Chris Parker's boyfriend cancels their big date, she reluctantly agrees to baby-sit for Sara and Brad Anderson. Chris thinks she is too old to baby-sit but Brad doesn't mind - he has a huge crush on Chris. When Chris gets to the Anderson's, she has just settled in for what she thinks will be a very boring evening when she gets a phone call from her friend Brenda who is stuck at a bus station in "The City". Chris agrees to pick up Brenda and has to take Sara, Brad, and Brad's friend Daryl, with her for what she hopes will be a quick trip. Instead, a flat tire leads to all kinds of adventures including a crazed tow truck driver; a stolen car ring; a gang fight; a visit to a Blues Bar; a frat party; a meeting with "Thor" (Sara's hero); and a heart stopping chase down the side of an office building. Suddenly, what looked to be one of the most boring nights of Chris's life turns out to be one of the most exciting."Adventures in Baby Sitting" is a good fun movie, the kind you can watch without thinking too much about it - the kind of movie that keeps you smiling the whole time you are watching it. Nothing in it is to be taken seriously (for one thing Brad is way too old to need a babysitter) and while there are bad guys, they are never too scary and the kids easily outsmart them. The film is non-stop action and there are a lot of fun scenes in the movie. The scene in the Blues Bar is an instant classic. This is a good family movie, but parents should be aware that there is some colorful swearing (but in a very funny scene). The acting is good. Elisabeth Shue shines as Chris; Keith Coogan is good as the love struck Brad; Maia Brewton is wonderful as Sara; and Anthony Rapp is sufficiently annoying as Darryl. Of the supporting cast, Calvin Levels is a standout as Joe Gipp, the not so bad car thief."Adventures in Babysitting" is a great comedy/action film.

Renie Jones has been obsessed for years with a house near her childhood home and gets her cousin, Bed and Breakfast owner Judith McMonigle Flynn, to visit the house with her. Judith has solved a few mysteries in her past and senses one now: why are the owners, Dick and Jane Bland, never seen? Why isn't Sally, Jane's sister who also lives there, ever seen? Why is there a mysterious package delivered to the house the same time every year? Judith's curiosity causes her to become a murder suspect when a body turns up in her car trunk - a body directly related to the Bland house."This Old Souse" is a very humorous but loosely plotted mystery. It's as if Mary Daheim had the basic idea of a story involving mysterious occupants of a house, wasn't sure how to get Judith and Renie to the house plausibly, but liked the idea so much that she decided to go ahead and have fun with it. And fun she does have, starting with the improbable names of Dick, Jane, and Sally. She delights in creating over the top characters, some of which can be fun, but some are totally unbelievable like the incompetent mailman and insensitive receptionist at the vet's office. If you've never read a book in this series, Judith and Renie can be hard to take at first. Judith claims to be interested in people, but she often comes across as just being nosy and expects people to confide in her even if they've just met for the first time. Renie can be annoying too, pushing her way around. Gertrude, Judith's ancient mother, has been abrasive in past books, but Daheim tones her down quite a bit in this book.Despite the awkward setup, the mystery itself has some nice moments, although about two thirds of the way into the book I figured out what was in the mysterious package left on the porch. Daheim does rely a bit too much on coincidence (Judith just happens to talk with the murder victim shortly before he is killed and his body is left in her car, which conveniently has a tricky trunk latch). But there are some really nice twists in the story that will keep the reader guessing who the murderer is."This Old Souse" is a good book for readers who like a nice, humorous, if light mystery.

In this entry in Maddy Hunter's humorous "Passport to Peril" mystery series, travel escort Emily Andrews brings her group of senior citizens from Iowa on a Hawaiian cruise. Also on the cruise is Professor Dorian Smoker, an expert on Captain Cook. Soon after one of the Iowans gives Smoker a journal with a treasure map that may lead to buried treasure, Smoker is thrown overboard by a mysterious assailant and presumed dead. There are plenty of suspects, including several people who disagreed with his theories on Captain Cook and several students who had an affair with Smoker. Emily finds herself not only investigating the murder, but also helping the Iowans try to find the buried treasure. When one of the treasure hunters is murdered and Emily herself is attacked, she realizes she needs to solve the mystery fast before anyone else gets hurt."Hula Done It" is a very funny mystery with lots of quirky characters. Emily is a lot of fun and her Nana is a hoot. Especially memorable characters are Jonathan, who is a waking disaster and Margi, who is obsessed with germs and carries an amazing array of items to prevent catching them. Duncan and Etienne, rivals for Emily's affection, are also on board. There are plenty of humorous moments in the book, although the humor in the scene where Emily takes a disastrous helicopter tour seems a bit forced. On the other hand, the Halloween costume party, where everyone starts acting like the character they are dressed as is laugh out loud funny. The mystery itself is nicely plotted, with Hunter throwing in a nifty twist at the end.Well worth reading.

Psychic Abby Cooper invests in a fixer-upper with her sister, Cat, and handyman Dave. Abby takes a month off from doing psychic readings to fix up her own house and the fixer-upper. Those plans are changed when her boyfriend, FBI agent Dutch Rivers, is shot and she has to nurse him back to health. Abby does work on the fixer-upper whenever she can but work stops when she and Dutch spot the ghost of a beautiful blonde which disappears before their eyes. Abby has already had visions about the house and now her psychic ability is telling her that the blonde woman had been murdered. When Abby and Dave's houses are both broken into and Abby is attacked, she realizes someone or something is trying to keep her away from the house. But when Abby finds a box hidden in the house and has another psychic vision about the woman, she knows she has to find the killer, even though Dutch is vehemently opposed to her getting involved. When Abby's office is broken into by someone searching for the box and another person is murdered, she is more determined than ever to find the killer."A Vision of Murder" is a well written, well done mystery. The psychic elements are very believable. Author Victoria Laurie does a great job describing how the psychic mind works, saying Abby's visions are a sensation like a telephone ringing in another room, only they are in Abby's head. Even though Abby is on vacation, she still has a chance to help people with her psychic ability which makes for some of the most interesting parts of the book. Abby's ability to tell if someone is dead merely by looking at their photo is also interesting. Abby is a very real heroine with some real problems, most noticeably the relationship with her uncaring parents. It's her relationship with other people that help make her such a great characters, especially her long-distance friendship with Medium Theresa; her friendship with handyman Dave, who will do literally anything to help her; and her friendship with her sister Cat. Her relationship with Dutch is one of best written parts of the book, the arguments they have are very realistic. And Abby's attempts to take their relationship to another level are some of the funniest parts of the book. There are other humorous moments, like the protective gear Dave wears when going into the haunted house. Another funny scene involves Cat, a bulldozer, and a police car. The mystery itself is nicely plotted, although there's never much doubt about who the murderer is. Finally, while Victoria Laurie introduces a new character, M.J. Holliday, who now has a series of her own, she does it so that M.J. fits right into the storyline rather than as a promo for the new series."A Vision of Murder" is a great mystery. Highly recommended.

It is the annual Pea Festival in Jane Jeffrey's hometown and Jane and her friend Shelley Nowack are participating in a number of activities including sorting through items at the Snellin Museum and taking part in a Civil War reenactment. Jane thought the reenactment would be interesting, but she wasn't expecting museum director Regina Price Palmer to be murdered during the battle. Jane's boyfriend, police detective Mel Van Dyne, is investigating the case, but Jane's work inside the museum gives her a good way of also investigating the murder since most of the suspects are involved in the museum. When there is a second murder, Jane is even more eager to solve the case before there is yet another victim."War and Peas" is an enjoyable, yet somewhat light cozy mystery. The book gets off to an interesting start with the Civil War reenactment and having the murder take place during the battle is a great touch since it provides plenty of suspects. Having the novel set around a pea festival and a pea museum is a very funny touch and not meant to be taken seriously by readers although the characters in the book are serious about it. There is a nice gentle sense of humor throughout the book with a few laugh out loud moments - one involving notes Jane's children leave her and when Jane cleans out her car. At this point in the series (this is the eighth book in the series) Jane is a fully developed and rich character as are the supporting characters in the book. The mystery is well written and well plotted and readers will have fun trying to figure out who the murderer is."War and Peas" is another nice cozy mystery by Jill Churchill.

Author Scott Landon died two years ago and his widow Lisey is starting to go through the papers he left behind. Going through his stuff is a painful process as Lisey finds many items that bring back memories of her relationship with Scott. But Lisey is about to experience real physical pain when a crazed fan of Scott demands some of his work. Despite calling the police, Lisey realizes the fan will kill her if she doesn't stop him. However, Lisey will learn that she's not alone; Scott's love for her was so great that he is able to help her one more time.If "Cell" could be considered to mark the return of Stephen King the master horror writer, "Lisey's Story" is the return of Stephen King the master storyteller. Lisey is a strong heroine, still dealing with Scott's death as well as the mental health issues of her sister Amanda. Even though Scott is dead as the book opens, Stephen King makes him seem alive. Scott's story is revealed slowly throughout the book and is heartbreaking, especially his childhood. Jim Dooley is a true mad man and Stephen King is at his scariest not when writing about the supernatural but when Dooley attacks Lisey in an all too realistic way.Long-time Stephen King fans will notice that he, as he often does in his books, mentions characters from some of his other novels, such as Michael Noonan, Norris Ridgewick and Andy Clutterbuck and will be delighted to visit Castle Rock again. Boo'ya Moon, where Scott went to hide from his demons (and he had plenty, including his father) is new to the Stephen King world, but elements of Boo'ya Moon will remind readers of other worlds of Stephen King and will also remind them of "thinnies". And, speaking of Boo'ya Moon, "Lisey's Story" has the most beautiful cover I've ever seen on a book."Lisey's Story" is one of Stephen King's best books.

Book the Eleventh in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, begins with Violet, Klaus and Sunny rushing down the Stricken Stream in a toboggan. Soon they are picked up by the submarine Queequeg, piloted by Captain Widdershins, with his stepdaughter Fiona, and Phil, an old friend from an earlier book, on board. The children are in search of a sugar bowl, which has vanished into a treacherous underwater cave, so small that only the children can enter it. Unfortunately, the cave is filled with poisonous mushrooms and soon the life of one of the Baudelaires is in danger. Just as they are rushing to find an antidote Count Olaf comes aboard the submarine and tries to throw the children in the brig. Will they escape from Count Olaf? Will they get an antidote in time? Where is the sugar bowl? And where did Captain Widdershins and Phil disappear to?Lemony Snickets answers some, but not all of those questions in this delightful entry in the series. As usual the book is filled with quirky characters, including Captain Widdershins and his constant use of the word "Aye" and his motto "He who hesitates is lost", Phil, who sees the bright side of everything, and Fiona, who knows an awful lot about mushrooms. Viola, Klaus and Sunny are all growing up, with Viola and Klaus showing interest in the opposite sex and learning that maybe their parents weren't perfect after all. Sunny is speaking more and more clearly and while it's still fun to try and decipher what she is saying, it's a lot easier than it was in the earlier books.These books are not just for children, as an adult, I really enjoy this series. I really liked this book, but it left a lot of questions that need to be answered in the two books remaining in the series. This book does end on a happier note than any of the previous books, which I found intriguing. I can't wait for the next one!

Sabrina and Daphne Grimm have been living with their grandmother for over a month and they are just now starting to go to school. Seven-year-old Daphne adjusts to school immediately, who wouldn't with Snow White as your teacher? Twelve-year-old Sabrina has a harder time adjusting; her teacher, Mr. Grumpner, lives up to his name, and the kids in her class aren't exactly friendly. Plus, she'd rather spend the time looking for her missing parents instead of being in school. But Sabrina's attention is soon caught after a series of attacks at the school. Before long, Sabrina, Daphne, their grandmother, and the faithful Mr. Canis are wrapped up in a series of events that threaten the entire town and beyond."The Unusual Suspects" is a great entry in what is proving to be a delightful series. Michael Buckley deftly weaves several fairy tales into the book, and to his credit, he uses elements from the book versions rather than the sometimes more popular movie version, as when Sabrina uses the golden cap from the Wizard of Oz books. Children will enjoy the fairy tale aspects of the book, while adults will appreciate the subtle humor in the scenes mimicking westerns and detective movies. Sabrina and Daphne are both very believable characters, especially Sabrina and her anger over her parent's disappearance. The fairy tale characters are also well done, presented as real people with real problems and readers will notice the irony at the despair of the Pied Piper of Hamelin when his own child disappears. And readers may be surprised at which fairy tale characters turn out to be heroes and which turn out to be villains. Finally, Buckley ends the book with quite a cliffhanger, which will make readers want to immediately read the next book in the series.Well done!

Set over a period of one year, Scarlet Feather is a novel featuring Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather, who open a catering company together. As they deal with the joys and heartbreak of owning a business their relationship with each other changes as does their relationship with the other's around them,notably Cathy's husband, Neil, who is a lawyer who wants to save the world and Tom's beautiful girlfriend, Marcella, who will do just about anything to make it as a model. Also involved are Cathy's parents, Muttie, who knows that the next bet he places will be the winner, and "his wife Lizzie", who used to clean for Neil's mother. Neil's family also plays an important part in the novel, especially his cousin Walter, and Maud and Simon, Walter's neglected 8-year-old brother and sister. Other characters include Cathy's family in America, her Aunt Geraldine, and their accountant James Byrne. By the end of the year, each character's life had changed, many in ways they never would have imagined.Maeve Binchy is a talented writer who can create many characters and make you care about each one, bad or good. Muttie, Maud and Simon are the characters that stood out the most to me. I wish Neil and Cathy's earlier relationship had been developed more, it's hard to understand what brought the two of them together. I do like the way the novel is set over the period of a year, it's amazing how much life can change in a year.I like Maeve Binchy's books, but there is something a bit melancholy about them, that, while I enjoy reading them, after I've finished it's a long time before I read another one.

After marrying and having children, Andy Gammon and her family moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts, her husband's hometown. Eager to be accepted, Andy has volunteered for several organizations. Her latest endeavor, helping to research her church's history, proves far more exciting than it sounds when a 200-year-old skeleton is found in the steeple of the church. Andy is curious as to who was killed and how his skeleton ended up in the steeple and begins to dig into the case while researching the church history. She is doing that when, much to her surprise, she stumbles across another body, one killed much more recently. As she digs into both cases, she begins to realize she is getting too close to the truth to be comfortable and soon her own life is in danger."Here's the Church, Here's the Steeple" was well written but just an okay mystery. The strength of the book is in its characters, especially Andy. Busy raising two young children while her husband is busy with his teaching job and contract negotiations, she still finds time to get involved in town activities. Her research work was interesting and it was fun to read as she unraveled the secrets of the town 200 years ago. Author Tempa Pagel does a good job of showing how busy and harried the life of a mother with young children can be. Pagel also does a good job of showing what life in a small town is like - many of the people have lived there for years and it's hard for newcomers to feel involved. Where the book failed for me is the mystery part. The first mystery is the best - Pagel includes flashbacks in the book that help supplement Andy's guessing at the identity of the body and how he died. Pagel cleverly mixes in things that happened in the past - arson that destroyed much of downtown Newburyport - with current events when an arsonist targets Andy's family. However, the murder mystery set in the present day wasn't as interesting or well written. Usually I enjoy trying to figure out who the murderer is, but there weren't enough clues in this book to do that."Here's the Church, Here's the Steeple" is a good, but not perfect mystery.

Extremely well researched and written "Triangle" is the story of the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factor that killed 146 workers, most of them young women. David von Drehle not only writes about the fire, but the events leading up to the fire, including a prolonged strike by garment workers in 1909. The conditions the workers had to deal with are also described as well as the incredibly long work week (100 hours) for low wages which the owners tried to make even lower whenever they could. Von Drehle describes in great detail the fire, the workers attempts to escape the fire and the efforts of people both inside and outside the factory that struggled to save the victims. He also describes the aftermath of the fire and covers the owner's trial and whether or not they were convicted on any charges. Finally, he includes the first complete list of the fire victims and how they died.I've wanted to learn more about the Triangle factory fire since I saw a TV movie about it in the late `70's. This book was very informative. The history parts were interesting and helped set the picture of what life was like at the time of the fire. The parts about the fire were hard to read at times not only because of the depictions of the victims dying but the memories it arose of September 11th as some victims were forced to jump from the ninth floor windows to escape the flames. The aftermath of the fire was also interesting, including what happened at the trial of the two owners of the Triangle. The list of the names of most of the victims (six were never identified) was compelling and makes readers realize the victims were mostly young women with the rest of their lives ahead of them. The list of victims is a perfect example of how well researched the entire book is - their names (and the various names misreported in the papers), ages, how they died, and who identified the bodies is listed.Because of the subject matter, "Triangle" is at times a difficult read, but well worth it.

Available only in the Fall and Winter, Mallomars are a seasonable favorite that fans snap up when they are on store shelves, often refrigerating or freezing them to snack on when they aren't available in stores. Mallomars consist of a round graham cracker, with marshmallow on top, and then covered in pure chocolate (the chocolate is the reason Nabisco gives for only selling Mallomars in the Fall and Winter - they claim the chocolate will melt on store shelves or in transport during the warmer months). Two cookies equal 120 calories.Although we don't go so far as stockpiling them, Mallomars are a favorite in my family. The combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker is perfect. Although the marshmallow is by far the most prominent taste, it is not overwhelming. The chocolate is delicious and the graham crackers are nice and soft. The cookies have a nice light taste, so they don't sit heavy in your stomach (they are round and about the size of a silver dollar but very satisfying). I also like the fact that they aren't loaded with calories or cholesterol (the saturated fat - serving size two cookies - is 15% Daily Value and the sodium is 2% Daily Value).Mallomars are a delicious seasonal treat.

After their success in catching a serial killer ("Getting Old Is Murder"), 75 year old Gladdy Gold, her sister Evvie, and friends Ida, Bella, and Sophie open the Gladdy Gold Detective Agency. They have plenty of clients, including a woman who thinks her 85 year old husband is cheating on her, plus they'd like to catch the flasher that is targeting their retirement complex. But that's not enough work for Gladdy, when she reads about the deaths of several rich women, she wonders if they were murdered. Her boyfriend, ex-cop Jack Langford and his policeman son, Morrie, tell Gladdy she's imaging things. But murder seems to find Gladdy and when she and her friends take a bingo cruise they find themselves on board with a killer.I liked "Getting Old Is the Best Revenge" even better than the first book in the series. The characters continue to develop and we learn more about how Gladdy's husband died and why she is so hesitant in her relationship with Jack. Having Gladdy open a detective agency is a great move as it will give author Rita Lakin a good plot device to have Gladdy get involved in more murder investigations. Lakin does stretch a bit with Gladdy and the girls ending up on the same cruise ship as a murderer and befriending the intended victim, but the cruise is so much fun that readers will forgive her. The murder is well plotted and readers will have a hard time figuring out who the murderer is. Readers who are easily offended should be aware that there is a sexual overtone throughout the book.This is an excellent cozy mystery.

Stephanie Plum is tired of her bounty hunter job. She's had enough of chasing after criminals, being shot at, her apartment always being broken into, and having her car blown up, so she quits her job. She has no problem finding a job, several jobs, in fact, but keeping them is a problem, as she manages to get fired as quickly as she is hired. Finally, Ranger hires her to work for him and she hopes her life will have some stability. But one of her past cases comes back to haunt her. Someone keeps blowing up her cars (again!) and leaving her threatening notes. She's not sure who's doing it, but she thinks it might be linked to some men missing from the `burg. And as if that wasn't enough, she has to get through her sister Val's wedding in a dress that makes her look like an eggplant!This was a much better book than the last one if the Stephanie Plum series, the disappointing "Ten Big Ones". All the old favorite characters are here: Joe Morelli, Ranger, Grandma Mazur, Lula, and Albert Kloughn. There are many humorous scenes; especially funny is the confrontation between Stephanie's Grandma Mazur and Joe's Grandma (at a wake, naturally!); a scene featuring a missing facial mole; and a scene involving Stephanie, her mother, Grandma Mazur and a wedding cake, which causes Stephanie to give up sugar, causing Joe much suffering. Stephanie's attempts at her various short term jobs are equally hilarious.What I liked about this book is how the characters have matured. Having Stephanie quit her job as a bounty hunter was a good move, opening up new storylines and forcing Evanovich to write something else besides the somewhat tired routines of Stephanie and Lula trying to catch FTA's. Evanovich does throw in a couple of bounty hunting scenes that easily could have been left out of the book, but perhaps she thought readers would be disappointed if they were to disappear altogether. Stephanie and Joe's relationship is also maturing, which I liked, even if it does lessen the sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger. There was a real mystery as part of the plot. And, while some might find the blowing up of cars a bit old, I found some of the scenes funny, especially the attempt to blow up the Buick.One last thought. While it's nice that Evanovich has a contest to let her readers name the next book in the series, I hate the "numbers" theme of these titles. The first three or four titles were somewhat amusing, but using numbers in each title is restricting and the titles have nothing to do with the books, which I find annoying.Aside from that, I loved this book and highly recommend it.

"Quicksolve Whodunit Puzzles: Challenging Mini-Mysteries" contains a series of mini-mysteries for readers to solve. The puzzles are very short, just one or two pages long and the answers are at the back of the book. There's a nice sense of humor throughout the book, mostly through the use of punny names starting with Professor Quicksolve and continuing with Officer Kautchya, Sergeant Shurshot, and Officer Longshot. While the names are fun, author Jim Sukach gets a bit carried away and names like Carl Crook, Lulu Lyuer, and Miss Pettithief are dead giveaways to adult readers. Although the book does not specify what age group it is written for, the book is clearly meant for younger readers, as most of the puzzles are too easy for adult readers. However, the mysteries should be just challenging enough for younger readers. Most of the mysteries have logical solutions, but a few ("Tracking Terrorists", "Dog Meet" and "Dit Dah Dilemma") are a bit of a stretch and probably shouldn't have been included."Quicksolve Whodunit Puzzles: Challenging Mini-Mysteries" is a good book to introduce young readers to the fun of solving mini mysteries.

Based on the "Dummies" series of books, "Shaping Up with Weights for Dummies" consists of twelve exercises with twelve repetitions that are each done twice. The video consists of an introduction and a warm up and the following exercises: squats; lunges; plie squats; one arm row; triceps one arm overhead extension; overhead press; biceps curl; shoulder raises; bent over fly; pushups; crunches; and oblique crunches. Some of the exercises require light weights - three to five pounds for women; eight to fifteen pounds for men; a chair; a mat or towel; and supportive athletic shoes."Shaping Up with Weights for Dummies" is ideal for those just beginning to exercise using weights. Tracy York is the instructor and she does a thorough job of explaining each and every move, showing practice moves before getting into the repetitions and also taking time to make sure your body is positioned correctly before doing each exercise. This is all done very slowly and you will not work up a sweat during the exercises. York also shows you variations in technique or tells you to add weights for more intensity, unfortunately, these suggestions come halfway through the exercise basically rendering the advice useless. The exercises first focus on the lower body, then the upper body, and finally the abs, so it is a thorough if somewhat unchallenging workout. Like in the Dummies books, there are icons that further explain what you are doing - the following icons pop up on the screen every so often: tip; jargon alert; beware; and myth busters. I thought these icons would be distracting but surprisingly they are not. Finally, while there is a warm-up segment on the DVD, there is no cool down, instead York has you stretch between the first set and second set of exercises."Shaping Up with Weights for Dummies" is excellent for people just starting an exercise routine but not challenging for someone who has been exercising for awhile.

Made for Exercise TV in conjunction with The American Heart Association, "Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone" contains two indoor walking exercising programs: a one mile "gentle" walking program and a two mile "brisk walk". Each walk is hosted by Leslie by herself and features a clock in the left-hand corner of the screen that counts down the minutes left in the program. Also included on the DVD are five mini walk/workout tips (Leslie mentions in the introduction a three mile walk but that is not included on this DVD).One Mile Gentle Walk:This is a nice energetic one mile walk that takes about 21 minutes (Leslie says it is a 15 minute walk but the 21 minutes include the warm-up, cool down, and stretches). The routine includes Leslie's four basic steps: walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts, as well as kick backs, walking forward and back, and upper arm movements. What I like about this one mile walk is that Leslie incorporates a few movements that make this a gentle yet somewhat brisk walk: double side steps, double knee lifts, and tap outs. Not only does it make you feel good about the one mile exercise but helps prepare you for some of the steps when you are ready to tackle the two mile walk.Two Mile Brisk Walk:This is a nice two mile indoor walk (it takes approximately 32 minutes to do) that gets your heart rate up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something at the end of the routine. Again it features Leslie's four basic steps as well but also adds in kick backs; double side steps; single knee lifts/double knee lifts/four knee lifts; side steps where you put your heel down in front; and tap outs that turn into lunges. Each mile takes about 15 minutes to complete and the second mile is more intense than the first. The cool down period lasts about five minutes including two and a half minutes of stretches. All of this makes for a nice brisk exercise program.Five mini walk/workout tips:These tips include Beginner Stretching; Brisk Walk Alternative for Beginners; Easy Walk to Stay Flexible; What Makes a Power Walk; and Anatomy of a High Knee March. Each of these is very brief (less than three minutes) and I really didn't find any useful information included.Summary:"Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone" contains two very good exercise routines for both beginners and long-time Leslie Sansone fans.

Beautifully written, A Virtuous Women, is the quiet love story of Ruby Pitt Woodrow, daughter of a rich farmer, and Jack Stokes, a tenant farmer. At first they seem an unlikely match, Ruby, although 20 years younger than Jack, is already widowed, Jack, unattractive and unsuccessful, has never been married. But both have had tough lives. Ruby is alienated from her parents due to her brief marriage which was a disaster. She is working as a maid when she meets Jack. Jack has never had much, although his dream is to own a piece of land. Together they find, if not what they were looking for, a sense of completeness.The book is written in first person narration with both Jack and Ruby narrating alternate chapters (except the last chapter which is written in the third person). This technique helps make both characters seem real. For me, personally, Jack was the character I most cared about, mostly because we know from the very beginning that Ruby dies and we see that Jack is lost without her.This is one of those simple, quiet kind of books where there is little action or plot, just the story of two people who come to love and care for each other. Yet, it's the kind of story that will stay with you long after you've read it.

Abigail Timberlake, owner of the "Den of Antiquity" an antique store, makes one of the winning bids on a locker at a locked trunk sale. She's pleased to discover that one of things in the locker is a collection of antique canes. She's less pleased to find a gym bag containing what looks like a human skull. She calls the police, who, after asking too many stupid questions, arrest Abby for obstruction of justice. Her mother quickly bails her out and Abby sets out to clear her name by questioning all the people who also bid on the locker, thinking one of them might be a murderer.This is a very funny book with lots of jokes and very little mystery. The plot meanders all over the place, from who is getting into the store and moving the antique canes, to who owned the skull that Abby found to who murdered the housekeeper/lover of one of the suspects. Halfway through I wondered why I was even reading this book until I came to the following sentence (describing an author in the book) "(her) novels are merely witty, relying far too heavily on humor and wordplay". Tamar Myers must have had her tongue planted firmly in cheek when she wrote that as she describes her own books perfectly. Her mysteries are filled with eccentric characters such as Abby, who knows shockingly little about antiques considering she owns an antique store; her mother, Mozilla, who dresses like a mother in a 50's sitcom; and her friend, C.J. who tells the most outrageous stories about her relatives. The mysteries are thin, but the books are at time laugh out loud funny and yes, involve lots of word play.Tamar Myers' mysteries are for those who love humorous books and don't mind reading a really light mystery.

Antiques dealer Abigail Timberlake Washburn outbids several people to buy a birdcage shaped like the Taj Mahal. With the cage is a Mynah bird named Monet. At first, Abigail cares more for the cage than the bird, but she soon grows to like the bird and is upset when Monet is birdnapped. The kidnappers demand a real Monet in exchange for the feathered version. Abigail doesn't have the real Monet, but the kidnappers soon strike again, this time kidnapping Abigail's mother, Mozella. Abigail works frantically to figure out what the kidnappers are really looking for as well as where they have hidden her mother.This is a very funny book. Readers may be laughing so hard they may not notice that the book is long on humor and short on plot. The "mystery" of Abigail's mother and bird being kidnapped is ignored for long stretches as Abigail encounters one eccentric character after another. While the regular characters of C.J. and the Rob-Bob's are always amusing (although jokes about Bob's cooking are overdone), minor characters such as FBI agents that Abigail nicknames Moldy and Scowler, seem thrown in the book just for the pun of it. I'd like to see less emphasis on the eccentric characters and more emphasis on the plot.This is a light but amusing series.

Fischer and Wieser's "The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce" is made with ripe raspberries and chipotle peppers and comes in a 20 ounce bottle. It is all-natural with no added preservatives and doesn't have too much sodium. It is smoky, sweet, and spicy and can be used in a number of different ways. It can be used as an accompaniment with any meat, fish or fowl such as steak, pork tenderloin, chicken wings, or trout. It can also be used as a salad dressing or poured over soft cheese and served with crackers.While it is quite versatile, I had a lot of issues with "The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce". To start with, it was hard to open and when I did get it open it was hard to pour. When I did get it to pour, too much sauce came out. Once I poured it, it was messy and spilled over the bottle. The raspberry seeds made it too lumpy and the seeds stuck in my teeth. As for the taste, it was too sweet for my taste and not nearly spicy enough. I'd prefer fewer raspberries and more chipotle."The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce" is the number one selling item for Fischer and Wieser, but I found it to be disappointing.

Barbara Ehrenreich's "Nickel and Dimed" is an interesting, if flawed, look at how people who work at minimum wage jobs get by in America. Ehrenreich takes on a series of low paying jobs - waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing home aid and clerk at Wal-Mart, working at each job for a month while finding out if she has enough money to find a place to live and pay for rent and still have money left over for groceries. The descriptions of each job and the amount of work she does for little pay is eye-opening as is the struggle to find affordable housing. The way management (as well as the general public) treats the workers is also eye opening. The "affordable" housing that Ehrenreich finds is often a squalid hotel room with little security. And with little money left over after paying rent, meals are hard to come by, and forget about being able to afford health insurance.The major flaw in this book is Ehrenreich herself. She's not really poor and it's hard for the reader to emphasize with her because it's clear she'll walk away after only a month in the job (often leaving her coworkers in the lurch). She also doesn't work consecutive months at a time, instead spreading the jobs over a long period of time, returning to her "real" life in between, so she never goes more than a month at a time having to live paycheck to paycheck. She never gets close to her coworkers, the true poor, which would have added real insight to how the poor really live. When Ehrenreich develops a rash, she's quick to call her own doctor and use her credit card to pay for the prescription, rather than use over the counter medicine. Towards the end, Ehrenreich seems to tire of her assignment and seems contents to live in a series of hotel rooms rather than really look for affordable housing. Her last stint at Wal-Mart seems suspicious - she turns down a higher paying job and then continually complains not only about having to take a drug test but the way management treats the workers. She complains that Wal-Mart pays so little that workers can't afford to buy clothes there, only mentioning in passing that employees get a discount. With all the media attention focussed on Wal-Mart, it's hard to believe her choosing to work there was accidental.In the end however, the book does make a difference, at least to me. I'll think twice before carelessly tossing clothes back on the rack wherever I feel like when I shop and will tip waitresses 20% if not more.

In this first book of a promising new series, Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women, tells readers of a time in her past when she helped solve a murder mystery. Shortly after going to a tea party where her friend, Dorothy Brownly Wortham, acts strangely, Dorothy is murdered. Dorothy had told Louisa she wanted to speak to her, but was killed before she had a chance to. Louisa is determined to find out how and why Dorothy was murdered.This was an extremely well written, well researched book. Louisa really came to life as a character, as did the rest of her family, especially her mother, Abba. The time period also came to life through the book. The mystery itself was well plotted, and the identity of the murderer unexpected.I'm looking forward to more books in this series.

Ella Brady has a nice, if quiet, life as a schoolteacher when she meets Don Richardson. She knows he is married, but falls hard for him and is soon having an affair with him. She completely trusts him, believing everything he tells her, and is shocked when he flees Ireland after having conned several people out of their money, including many of Ella's friends and her own father. Shamed, Ella quits teaching and takes on several part time jobs to help her family financially. One job she takes on involves filming a documentary about Quentins, a beloved restaurant in Dublin, which has served many people with quite interesting stories. Ella flies to New York to convince businessman Derry King to invest in the documentary. As she is trying to get the documentary off the ground, she is also struggling with her conscience as to whether or not she should return Don's laptop to him or turn it over to the police who are looking for him. Not an easy decision as she is convinced that Don still loves her."Quentins" is a mixed bag. Interspersed with Ella's story are short stories about the patrons of Quentins, a technique that threw me off at first because I had no idea who the characters were that showed up halfway through the book and thought I had missed something. Ultimately, however, the short stories prove more interesting than Ella's story, as she is the type of character that readers will feel like shaking (how she can believe Don still loves her until almost the end of the book is beyond me). I would have liked to know more about some of the minor characters that are in the short stories, especially Quentin himself, who appears far too briefly in the novel.Several of Binchy's beloved characters appear throughout the book. We learn more about Patrick and Brenda Brennan, who run Quentins, and meet Patrick's brother Blouse. Ria and Colm from "Tara Road" show up, albeit briefly, and Tom and Cathy from "Scarlet Feather" appear as do Simon and Maude, who may be my all time favorite Binchy characters. Aidan and Signora from "Evening Class" show up and Quentins nicely wraps up their love story. These touches are what ultimately make "Quentins" worth reading.

"Before the Change: Taking Charge of Your Menopause" by Ann Louis Gittleman explains how to control your Menopause symptoms by changing your diet. There are two parts to the book: Part One is called "Alleviating Symptoms" and Part Two is called "The Changing Diet". The book starts with a list of Perimenopause symptoms and a quiz to see if you are in Perimenopause. The book covers topics such as how to curb carbs, vitamins and minerals, natural hormone cream, exercising, and safe estrogen replacement therapy. There are also several case studies in the book. The Changing Diet Plan Section also includes several recipes. A major part of the book is ten remedies for Perimenopause symptoms. Gittleman calls these remedies "All-Star Peri Zappers" and they include: Flaxseed oils and ground flax seeds; black currant seed oil; multivitamins and magnesium; zinc; natural progesterone cream; exercise; destressing stress; adrenal refresher; hesperidin; and natural estrogen replacement."Before the Change: Taking Charge of Your Menopause" is a good book for women who like to try and control their Menopause symptoms, especially through diet and nutrition. Gittleman is a nutritionist and the book mainly focuses on how women can use nutritional therapy for Menopause symptoms. There are several useful lists in the book including a list of symptoms caused or made worse by estrogen dominance; a list of Perimenopause symptoms caused by magnesium deficiency; and a list of symptoms of hypothyroidism. There is a very helpful quiz designed to figure out if you burn food fast or slow. The case studies are very interesting. The recipes were also very useful, as where the natural quick fixes for Perimenopause symptoms. What I especially liked about the book is that the lists of symptoms and case studies show that Menopause is a real, but controllable part of life.While I found the book to be helpful for the most part, there were a few things I didn't like about it. Gittleman spends a little too much time promoting not only books she has written, but several times she'll say that only one product will work effectively and gives the brand name. This happens so often I was beginning to wonder if she was getting a commission from the companies. Her chapter on exercise, an important element in controlling Menopause symptoms, is extremely short and doesn't really explore how important exercise is for aging women. Her suggestion to wash food with a combination of Clorox and water seems extreme, to say the least."Before the Change: Taking Charge of Your Menopause" is a useful, but flawed book on Menopause.

"Hey! It's That Guy!" is a neat little guide to character actors. It has thirteen chapters devoted to various types of roles (the courtroom, the hospital, the office, and the precinct, for example) and features pictures and descriptions of actors that are best known for playing those types of roles. There are also various very helpful icons used throughout the book such as award winner, straight to video, villain and deceased. Also included in the portrait of each actor is a timeline with his or her most famous roles listed.For the most part, this is a very useful guide for looking up actors that look familiar. The descriptions of each actor are humorous but informative. There are several useful indexes in the back of the book and best of all a section with the pictures and names of all the actors featured in the book. Unfortunately, the book is on the small size; I would have preferred a larger book, with more roles listed for each actor. And some of the pictures are movie stills and not very clear, which is shame since the pictures should be the strong point of the book.All in all, movie and trivia buffs will enjoy this reference book.

Nick Arden's wife Ellen disappears after an accident at sea and after she is missing for seven years, he has her declared legally dead so he can remarry. As luck would have it, Ellen returns the very day he remarries and tracks him down at his honeymoon hotel. The second he sees Ellen, Nick realizes he still loves her but he has to first break the news to Bianca, his new wife, as well as tell his children that their mother is still alive. Hilarious complications ensue as Nick tries to find just the right time to tell Bianca and when he discovers that Ellen was marooned on the island with the hunky, athletic Stephen Burkett.This is a very funny movie. As with all screwball comedies, you have to take everything with a grain of salt (what are the odds that Ellen would return the very day Nick remarries?) and not think too much about it (just what happened between Ellen and Burkett on that island?) but the laughs are worth it. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Ellen convinces a shoe salesman to pose as Burkett. The movie skips over the issue of bigamy by hinting that Nick's second marriage wasn't consummated and while Burkett seems to be in love with Ellen, she only has eyes for Nick. Or course, it would have been easy for Nick to simply tell Bianca that Ellen was his wife, but that would have taken away from the fun of the movie.The actors are excellent. Cary Grant was a great actor and could make you laugh without saying a word - the scene in which he first spots Ellen is a perfect example. Irene Dunn is a delight as Ellen; Gail Patrick is a cool if puzzled Bianca; Randolph Scott is a hunky Burkett. Donald MacBride as a confused hotel manager and Granville Bates as a befuddled judge almost steal the movie.This is a delightful screwball comedy.

In this entertaining sequel to Gremlins, Billy Peltzer and Kate Beringer have moved to New York where they work for Clamp Enterprises in a high tech office building. When his owner dies, lovable Gizmo is taken prisoner and held in a Laboratory in the Clamp office building. When Billy finds out, he rescues Gizmo and hides him in a filing cabinet in his cubicle until he can take him home. Of course, it doesn't take long before two of the three rules about Gremlins are broken: Gizmo gets wet and spawns lots of little Gremlins who quickly find a way to eat after Midnight. Soon the Gremlins take over the office building and threaten to take over New York. Once again it's up to Billy, Kate, and Gizmo to stop them.This is a thoroughly enjoyable sequel. While the original was a dark and at times violent comedy, this is a straight out comedy which spoofs everything from the Wizard of Oz to Rambo to the first Gremlins movie itself. Daniel Clamp, owner of Clamp Enterprises, is a funny takeoff on Donald Trump. The fully automated office building is a hoot and even funnier when the Gremlins wreak havoc with it. There are so many jokes and sight gags in the movie that you can watch it over and over again and still see things that you missed before. Even some of the extras on the DVD are spoofs; the behind the scenes documentary is especially funny.The actors are all wonderful, especially Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates as Billy and Kate. Dick Miller returns as Mr. Futterman, still shaky with his first encounter with the Gremlins (who actually killed him in the first movie), but willing to fight them. John Glover nails the part of Daniel Clamp. All the actors seem to be having fun in the movie, which makes it even more enjoyable.Highly recommended.

Meggie, 12, and her father, Mo, share a love of books. In fact, their house is full of books. But, despite their constant reading, Mo will never read out loud to Meggie. She wonders why until one day a stranger, Dustfinger, shows up at their house and Meggie discovers the awful truth. When reading out loud, Mo has the ability to read characters out of the book and into real life. Unfortunately, he has no control over which character he reads out and one terrible day when Meggie is 3, he reads out a terrible villain, Capricorn, out of a novel called "Inkheart". As if that wasn't bad enough, Mo inadvertently reads his wife, Teresa, into the book. Nine years later, Dustfinger warns Mo that Capricorn is looking for him because he wants Mo to read more evil characters out of "Inkheart". Mo and Meggie go on the run, but it's not long before Capricorn catches up with Mo, Meggie, Dustfinger and Meggie's Aunt Elinor. When Meggie finds out that she too can read characters out of books, she is in even more danger."Inkheart" is a charming fantasy. Cornelia Funke is a gifted writer and readers will be instantly drawn into Meggie's world. The premise of being able to read characters out of books is an intriguing one and Funke utilizes it fully. The characters are well written: Meggie is an engaging heroine; Mo is a loving, if somewhat unreliable father; Elinor is better at dealing with books than people, but grows as a character as the book moves along. Dustfinger is perhaps the most interesting and human character, he is neither totally good nor bad, but, read into the "real" world he longs to return to the world of "Inkheart" and will do anything, even betray his friends, to achieve that goal."Inkheart" does have some flaws. One flaw is it's length, at 534 pages the size of the book may put off young readers and those that start it may lose interest along the way. Funke could easily have cut out some minor characters and scenes (Tinker Bell was especially annoying). Also, although Mo reads characters into stories as he is reading characters out of them, Funke seems to forget that at times and uses it only when it is needed as a plot device. Finally, a character that is mute is suddenly able to scream, a development that pulled me right out of the story.Those minor points aside, "Inkheart" is a wonderful fantasy for young and old alike.

On the afternoon of July 6, 1944, a fire broke out during a performance of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in Hartford, Connecticut. The circus tent had been waterproofed with gasoline and paraffin and the fire spread quickly with 167 people (mostly women and children) ultimately dying and many others horribly burned. "The Circus fire" details the events leading up to the fire (although the worst, this was not the first fire to hit the circus), the fire itself and the ensuing panic, and the aftermath of the fire, up until 1999. There are accounts from victims of the fire, the firefighters, circus performers, and neighbors that helped out, as well as many pictures that show the horrible results of the fire. The book follows several survivors through their recovery and how they are doing years after the fire."The Circus Fire" is a well-written and well-researched book. Stewart O'Nan is a gifted writer and his description of the fire and the frantic attempts of the circusgoers to escape are written so that the reader can picture what is happening as they read the book. In fact, he described it so well that I had to put the book aside at times because I was having nightmares about the fire. His description of the confusion after the fire as parents searched frantically for their missing children and how neighbors and strangers pitched in to help is equally moving (and unsettling at times as some neighbors actually charged a fee for the victims to use their phones). He mentions Little Miss 1565 who died in the fire and was never identified despite the fact that her face was barely burnt (O'Nan successfully debunks the theory that Little Miss 1565 was Eleanor Cook). Her story will haunt the reader as will the story of Raymond Erickson who was taken to a hospital and whose clothes were found there but his body was never located. Also moving is the story of how the survivors dealt with the aftermath of the fire; many had nightmares years after the fire.The only problem I had with the book is that it switched from person to person and it was often hard to keep track of who was who, especially when there were long gaps between their story. I wish there had been a list of victims at the back of the book or at least a list of the fate of the people specifically mentioned in the book."The Circus Fire" is a moving account of a real life tragedy.

It's the year 1916 and Henry and James Yewbeam have been sent to live at Bloor's Academy with their Uncle Gideon Bloor because their sister Daphne has Diphtheria. One day Henry is alone playing marbles when his cousin Zeke rolls a marble known as the "Time Twister" towards him. Henry can't resist the beautiful marble, but when he grabs it, he is propelled almost ninety years into the future. Fortunately, he meets his cousin Charlie Bone who hides him so the Bloor's can't find him. It's not easy, many of the students at Bloor Academy are "endowed" with special powers and some use their powers in malevolent ways. Plus, Charlie's Yewbeam aunts would like to get a hold of Henry. It will take all the efforts of Charlie, his friends, and his Uncle Paton to keep Henry safe."Charlie Bone and the Time Twister", the second book in Jenny Nimmo's the Children of the Red King series, is a charming if somewhat derivative book. In the front of book, there is a list of the endowed children at Bloor's Academy and their special powers, which is a useful reference. However, Nimmo can be a bit inconsistent with the powers. For example, Gabriel Silk can feel other people's emotions by touching their clothes, which literally causes him pain at times, yet at other times he casually handles people's clothes with no problem at all. Otherwise, the supernatural elements are nicely done; I especially love the "flames", three seemingly ageless cats, who have a knack of being there when needed. While Nimmo has a good story going on in this series, her writing could be tightened up as she spends too much time telling her readers what is going on instead of letting the action show them. Also, too many times she uses the word famous needlessly, why exactly would gerbils be famous? Henry disappears from the book for long stretches of time; it would have been nice to see more of his side of things. Nimmo does have a nice sense of humor in the book and I loved the word play: Tancred Torsson, who has the ability to create storms, lives in Thunder House on Hail Road."Charlie Bone and the Time Twister" is good fun for young and old alike, but children may enjoy it more as adults might like a deeper read.

I've read almost all of Betty Neel's books and this is now one of my favorites.Eulalia Warburton is working in a flower shop and struggling to make a life with her old friend, Trottie and her deceased cousin's eight year old son, Peter. Fenno van Linssen is a wealthy doctor who walks into her flower shop and much to her dismay, keeps showing up in her life. Fenno is engaged to a beautiful but selfish woman who is only marrying him for the prestige of being a doctor's wife. Fortunately, he realizes this before he marries her and works things out satisfactorily between him and Eulalia.The characters are great, Peter and Trottie are especially well-written. There's even a second love story that will make readers smile.Reading Betty Neels is like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter's night, her books makes you feel warm and cozy.

Kaz's Personal Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier is a small portable humidifier that provides relief from dry air. It is perfect for your bedroom, office, or dorm room and has two settings (high and low). The tank holds up to gallon of water and the humidifier works in areas up to 150 square feet.What I like about the humidifier:The humidifier is small enough that it doesn't take up much room and you don't have to rearrange the room to fit it in. It needs no filter which is a major plus since you don't have to worry about the added expense of replacing the filter. There is a constant mist which helps humidify the room. It does an excellent job in my bedroom and I can really tell the difference in air quality when I use it and when I don't use it. It is a bit noisy but quieter than other humidifiers that I've used. It is very easy to clean - you basically just have to wipe it down after use - and it doesn't get any of the gunk I've seen accumulate on other humidifiers are repeated use. It is also more durable than other humidifiers that I've used which tend to only last one winter.What I don't like about the humidifier:The tank is a little too small. Although the humidifier is supposed to run 8 - 12 hours (on the lowest setting) I find that it barely lasts eight hours on that setting before running out of water. Make sure you don't place the humidifier on a valuable piece of furniture as "white dust" can be a problem (this can be eliminated by using distilled water which can get expensive). My bedroom windows develop condensation after using the humidifier.Bottom-line:While I wish the humidifier ran longer, it does an excellent job and is easy to clean and use. Recommended.

Kelly Flynn is staying in Fort Connor, Colorado until she settles the estate of her late aunt and cousin. She was left a great deal of property and it may take months to settle the estate, and Kelly is beginning to think she may never leave. She is doing accounting work from her house, making friends, and enjoying learning how to knit. Since she is learning about different types of wools, she volunteers to take a group of tourists to visit Vickie Caymore's alpaca farm. To her shock, she finds Vickie's body. As the police investigate the murder, Kelly helps Vickie's daughter Debbie settle her financial matters. Debbie is convinced that her stepfather killed her mother because she was in the process of divorcing him, but he swears to Kelly he didn't do it and she begins to believe him. When the murderer strikes again, Kelly realizes she has to do what she can to stop the killer before someone else is killed.While it had some good points, I found "Needled to Death" to be a disappointing mystery. For the most part, Kelly was a good heroine - still dealing with her aunt's death and trying to decide if she should stay in Colorado or go back to Washington, D.C. I loved her golf ball stealing dog, Carl. Her tentative romance with Steve was sweetly done. Some of the secondary characters such as Debbie, Jayleen, and Burt were well written. But much of the book was unbelievable. Kelly constantly worries about money, wondering whether she can afford to quit her D.C. job and work as a consultant in Colorado, yet she never seems to work instead spending her time knitting with her friends, drinking coffee, or playing softball. And considering the size of the estate her aunt left her, including a ranch in Wyoming with plenty of cattle, the constant fretting about money seemed overdone. The writing is sloppy - having characters named Burt and Curt confused me. As for the mystery itself, while the identity of the murderer may come as a surprise to readers, the second murder is so obviously telegraphed that readers will know which character is doomed long before the murder takes place. The book has some major editing issues - early in the book one of the suspects approaches Kelly at her cottage after she came home from Vickie's funeral, but at the end of the book she says he approached her while she was still at the funeral. That's sloppy writing and editing.With some good editing and tighter writing "Needled to Death" could have been so much better.

In this charming romance by Betty Neels, Josephine Dowling is working as a ward sister at a London hospital and engaged to be married when she meets Julius van Tacx. But she's not really sure she loves Malcolm, her fianc&eacute;, and is having doubts about marrying him, and especially living so close to his family, so she breaks off her engagement. As if having to deal with a broken engagement wasn't enough, she has to deal with Julius who always seems to turn up at the worst possible time. When he asks her to marry him,she finds herself agreeing although she's not in love with him. But her feelings soon change to love. How can she stay married to a man who doesn't return her feelings?I love reading Betty Neels when I need to escape from the real world. There's nothing surprising in her books, you know that the couple will meet, clash, have a misunderstanding or two, maybe be involved in a crisis where the heroine will shine (in this book it's a car accident) and eventually will live happily ever after. And, some days, that's just the kind of book I need to read!

Security expert and bounty hunter Ranger is used to catching wanted people, but now he's the one who is wanted. There's a woman looking for him who claims she is married to him. He has another big problem - someone who looks a lot like him has kidnapped his daughter. His friend, bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, has her own problems. Even though it's her job, she's not particularly good at bounty hunting and each apprehension is difficult. She's also dealing with her grandmother's decision to become a rock star. On top of that, she's being stalked by someone who wants everything that Ranger has, including Stephanie."Twelve Sharp" is an extremely funny book and much better than the last Stephanie Plum book, "Eleven on Top". Most of the regular characters are included: Stephanie's parents, Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's on and off boyfriend Joe Morelli, Lula, Connie, and Sally Sweet are all there. Readers will be happy that Janet Evanovich gives a little more insight into the mysterious Ranger's private life. Evanovich adds a new character, Melvin Pickle, who brings a lot of fun to the book. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Connie, Lula, and Stephanie interview potential bounty hunters. Some of the captures that Lula and Stephanie make are equally funny. Evanovich wisely ditches some of the tired plot lines such as Stephanie's car always being blown up and breathes new life into other plot lines - especially an incredibly funny scene during a wake. Unfortunately, she does add a food fight scene - something that I wish could be banned from all books and movies! Still, most of the book is hilarious, even the tension filled ending has laugh out loud moments.A wonderful read.

Ten year old Charlie Bone discovers he has a unique talent - he can hear the thoughts of people in photographs. Charlie's Grandmother Bone and her sisters are delighted that Charlie has inherited powers, the gift runs in the family and his late father also was one of the "endowed". They insist that Charlie attend Bloor's Academy where he can further develop his powers. Charlie reluctantly goes and soon realizes there are odd things going on at Bloor's. Before he quite knows exactly what is going on, Charlie is deep in a mystery involving a case with something mysterious inside it and a missing child and also discovers his father may not be dead after all."Midnight for Charlie Bone" was a good first book in what looks like a promising series. Comparisons with Harry Potter are inevitable but the book should be judged on it's own merit and it's not bad at all. Charlie is a strong character, a good friend to misfit Benjamin, and his struggles with his newly developed powers are very real. The other children in the book are well written, especially the delightful Olivia. The adults in the book are either just plain bad, or, with the exception of Charlie's Uncle Paton, good but ineffectual.Even though the book is 400 pages long, parts of it felt rushed, especially the ending and the surrender of the bad guys. And, perhaps it's just me, but some of the happenings in the book seemed unexplained, like who initially opened the door and let Emma out of her "prison". Still, the book makes me want to continue reading the series, especially to see if the person I suspect is Charlie's father really is.A good beginning.

I have a lot of "gadgets" and many of them run on batteries, most often on AA batteries. Some batteries last in items a long time; other items I have, like the remote for my TV, burn up batteries about once a week. Because of that, I was eager to try the Panasonic LR-6GA/8B Digital Power AA Alkaline Batteries to see if they last any longer than other batteries I've used. So far so good. They seem to last longer in things like my digital camera, the TV remote (three weeks and counting), and my Flip video camera. I'm thrilled at the thought of going through less batteries.The Panasonic LR-6GA/8B Digital Power AA Alkaline Batteries do a good job.

At the end of "Inkheart" Dustfinger still hadn't found his way back into the world Mo had read him out of. He desperately wants to go back and finally finds someone, Orpheus, who reads him back into the ink world. But Dustfinger leaves Farid, his apprentice, behind and Farid wants to be with the man he has grown to love like a father. Meggie longs to visit the ink world and is able to read herself and Farid there, leaving behind Mo and Resa, her parents, and her Aunt Elinor. But Mo and Resa soon find out that they cannot escape the ink world as they too are read there.At 635 pages, and the second part of a planned trilogy, "Inkspell" is truly a work of epic proportions. The length may be a bit off putting for some young readers, but many will be pulled into the fantasy world and will keep reading to find out what happens next. And plenty does happen, "Inkspell" is basically a tale of good versus evil and there are many battles and other excitement along the way.Meggie is a good, strong character, loving and loyal, if a bit headstrong. Of her parents, Mo is the strongest character, perhaps because Meggie is closer to him than she is to her mother. Readers learn more about Dustfinger and why he is so anxious to return to a world that he knows will be fatal to him. Fenoglio, the author of "Inkheart" (the book within the book) can be annoying at times and by the end I was hoping he would write himself out of the book! Poor Aunt Elinor barely makes a cameo appearance; it's almost as if Cornelia Funke didn't know what to do with her. The villains are all purely evil, especially Basta and the Adderhead. As long as the book is, Funke seems to skip over some of the parts that seem the most interesting, for example, there's much talk about how dangerous Night-Mares are, but they are never shown.Parents should be aware that there's a great deal of violence in this book. Not only are there wars, but people are shot, stabbed, and burnt and not all survive. "Inkspell" is a great fantasy, but may be a bit upsetting for younger readers.

"Liquid Paper DryLine Mini Correction Tape" sounds like a great idea and when it works, it works well. It instantly covers up mistakes (or anything you don't want people to see) - there is no need to wait for it to dry. It also covers things up more quickly than regular wite-out, it covers them up better (nothing leaks through), and you can cover up more things in a shorter period of time. Unfortunately, for me it worked well for a short period of time and then it stopped working. The witeout tape stopped dispensing and ended up getting tangled up inside the dispenser. At first I thought I had a defective dispenser but I had the same problem with every dispenser in the pack."Liquid Paper DryLine Mini Correction Tape" is a nice idea but it never quite worked right for me.

Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay for and stars in this excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel "Sense and Sensibility". Thompson is wonderful as Elinor Dashwood, in love with Edward Ferrars. Hugh Grant is good as Edward, in love with Elinor, but unsure if she returns his love, since she is so restrained in her actions, she doesn't show her feelings. Kate Winslet shines as Marianne, who is passionate about life and doesn't believe in hiding her emotions. Alan Rickman, in a nice guy role for a refreshing change, is excellent as Colonel Brandon, who is in love with Marianne. Greg Wise, Harriet Walter, and Hugh Laurie are also excellent in supporting roles."Pride and Prejudice" has long been my favorite Jane Austen novel. But this movie brought "Sense and Sensibility" to life so well that I now want to reread that novel and live in Jane Austen's world yet again.

Having finished the Dark Tower books, but not willing to leave Roland and his ka-tet quite yet, I read The Road To The Dark Tower to take one more trip into Roland's world. I wasn't disappointed. The book begins with an overview of the history of the books and there is a chapter for each of the seven books, describing and analyzing the action in each one. The rest of the chapters deal with other Stephen King books that are related to the Dark Tower series; a detailed description of each major character in the books; works that influenced the series; discussion of whether the books are Stephen King's Magnum Opus; two time lines (fact and fictional); a mid-world glossary; Dark Tower on the web; and the poem the influence the dark Tower series "Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came".I bought this book because I recognize Bev Vincent's name from his numerous posts on various Stephen King forums and newsletters and am always impressed with his knowledge. This book is a prefect example, even though I've read all of the Dark Tower books (the early ones several times), I still learned things I hadn't known before. Although the entire book was good, I find the chapters summarizing the books the most interesting, especially where Bev pointed out things that foreshadowed the ending of the last Dark Tower book.Dark Tower fans will love this book

While DJ Mulrooney is picnicking in the woods with his grandchildren, his granddaughter discovers a couple of gnomes living there, who think they are the only gnomes left in the world. JC agrees to help them find other gnomes and all kinds of complications ensue, including stolen gnomes, a stay in and escape from an insane asylum, car chases and a race to catch a "greased" gnome.The Gnome-Mobile is a typical Disney Film from the `60's - silly but lots of fun to watch. Walter Brennan is great as both DJ and one of the gnomes, while Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (listed in the credits as the kids from Mary Poppins) are okay as his grandchildren. It's fun spotting the character actors who seem to appear in just about every comedy made in the 60's including Richard Deacon, Frank Cady, Ellen Corby and Charles Lane. Ed Wynn appears all to briefly as a gnome.The Gnome-Mobile is a good, fun family film.

On December 30, 1903, the Iroquois Theatre in Chicago was crowded beyond capacity with theatergoers eager to see Eddie Foy in "Mr. Blue Beard". The well-written and well-researched "Tinder Box" by Anthony Hatch describes what happened that tragic afternoon when a spotlight short-circuited starting a fire that eventually killed over 600 people.Considering the fact that the fire happened over 100 years ago, with no living witnesses to interview and many facts have been lost in time, Hatch does an admirable job describing the events leading up to the fire, the fire itself, and the aftermath. He does an excellent job describing how the Iroquois came to be built and the haste with which it was built (it only took five months) and the shoddy workmanship involved, as well as how many officials were willing to turn their heads and ignore the many fire code violations at the Iroquois. His description of the crowded theatre the day of the fire is mind boggling; one victim in fact called the theater a fire trap as she went to her seat. There were over 500 more people than capacity in attendance; the exit doors opened in instead of out; and the person who was supposed to operate the fire curtain was a substitute who didn't know which lines actually worked the curtain. There was little done to help the audience and incredibly enough the actors continued to perform while the fire was burning. Hatch also gives descriptions of the fire victims and survivors, which make the tragedy even more real. Some of the ways people escaped the fire were incredible and there were many heroes that night. There were also many villains that night and Hatch describes they way people robbed some of the dead. Hatch also covers the aftermath of the fire including the trial and how the owners tried to blame the victims and how evidence was tampered with.Although Hatch did not write the book until 2002, he had started to research it back in the 1960's and at that time had interviewed a fireman who had fought the fire and a newspaper reporter who covered the fire. Those accounts helped make the scene of the fire real as I was reading the book. There was no spot photography at the time, so while there are pictures of the theatre before and after the fire, there are no actual pictures of the fire itself. But Hatch includes many drawings done at the time of the fire that show how horrible it was. He also includes editorial cartoons that show how much the fire touched the lives of people in Chicago. There is not a list of people who died in the fire because there was never an exact count of how many people did die."Tinder Box" is a well-written account of a tragic event in Chicago's history.

Nell MacDermott is devastated when her husband, Adam Cauliff, dies in a boat explosion. Her grief is made worse because she had quarreled with Adam the day before he died about her desire to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and run for political office. When people start questioning whether Adam was involved with shady real estate deals, Nell struggles to clear his name before it ruins her political chances. She reluctantly uses the help of a psychic who claims that Adam is speaking to her from another world. But the digger she deeps, Nell finds out much more about Adam than she expected in her search for the truth.This was a disappointing thriller. The characters are bland. Nell's running for political office seems to be simply a plot device, as there's little talk of politics in the novel. Adam appears only briefly before he disappears and is so obnoxious that it's hard to believe Nell would marry him. Dan Minor, a doctor looking for his long lost mother, is the most interesting character in the novel and I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been about him and not Nell.This book could have used a good editor. Parts of the plot make no sense. Nell has show signs of psychic ability, including seeing her dead parents and auras around people, yet when her aunt pressures her to go see a psychic, Nell says she doesn't believe in psychic ability! Early on Lisa Ryan calls Nell; several chapters later Lisa has to call Nell's grandfather because she doesn't have Nell's phone number! And Nell twice has the same conversation with two cops about a safety deposit box key. This was so annoying that it ruined the flow of the book and the story lost all credibility for me. Finally, I figured out the twist early on, but it was never fully explained how it was carried out and several plot threads were left hanging.For devoted Mary Higgins Clark fans only.

Stephanie Plum usually encounters danger during her job as a bounty hunter, but this time it happens while she's off-duty. While buying nachos at a local deli, she witnesses a robbery and gets a good look at the robber's face. He wants Stephanie dead, but she refuses to stay inside Joe Morelli's (her on and off again boyfriend) house all day long, angering Morelli. She hides at Ranger's apartment (one of his apartments, that is), while trying to catch the gang leader before he has her killed.Janet Evanovich's books always have plenty of humor and this is no exception. Especially funny is the hiring of "Sally", a transvestite, as the wedding planner for Stephanie's sister's weeding. But nothing new really happens in this book although we get a glimpse of Ranger's apartment, and how he lives, at least part of the time. Connie is in the book a little bit more and the scene where she, Stephanie, and Lula "kidnap" someone is hilarious. But this book mostly reads like every other book in the series. Stephanie's car gets blown up, she eats too much and then worries about her weight, she and Morelli fight, she lusts after Ranger, etc. etc.Fans of Stephanie Plum will like this book, but it isn't the best in the series.

In this mystery, Bed-and-breakfast hostess Judith McMonigle and her new husband, Police Lieutenant Joe Flynn, are on their honeymoon at Buccaneer Beach. But during a dune buggy ride, Joe crashes the buggy, breaking his leg. Judith calls her cousin Renie who agrees to stay with her while Joe is in the hospital. Soon after Renie arrives, they find their landlady dead in their cottage, strangled to death with a kite string. Never one to pass up a mystery, Judith and Renie investigate the murder, as well as look for a buried treasure. Can they solve the mystery and find the treasure before returning home?This is another fun "cozy" mystery by Mary Daheim. There are tons of humorous moments in this book. It's well plotted and, while I was able to figure out who the murderer was near the end of the book, there were still a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming.I've read several of these bed and breakfast books by Mary Daheim and I enjoy them more and more. Highly recommended!

"The Mensa Genius Quiz-A-Day Book" contains 366 puzzles (including one for leap years). The puzzles cover a wide variety including cryptograms, picture puzzles, math puzzles, riddles, palindromes, Tom Swifties, and more. The book is divided into months and at the start of each month there is a description of how the month got its name and some other interesting facts about the month. The answers are at the back of the book and each answer tells what percentage of Mensa members got the right answer for that particular puzzle."The Mensa Genius Quiz-A-Day Book" is a good book for people who want to keep their mind active by doing at least one puzzle a day. The puzzles are varied in such a way that if you find a puzzle tough one day, the puzzle the next day won't seem as hard. My favorite puzzles are the word puzzles (palindromes, anagrams, riddles, mini-mysteries, etc.) while I'm not too fond of or particularly good at the math puzzles. For the most part, the book is evenly divided between the types of puzzles, but there are a few times when it seems like there are several of the same type of puzzle in a row. Although the book says Mensa, you don't have to be a Mensa member to do the puzzles (I'm not). The answer section gives a detailed explanation of each answer, which ultimately helps you solve similar types of puzzles. By the end of the book you should be able to solve or at least have an understanding of how each puzzle works."The Mensa Genius Quiz-A-Day Book" is hours of challenging fun for everyone.

Clownfish Marlin loses his entire family, except for his son, Nemo. Because of his loss, Marlin is an overprotective father, stifling Nemo, while trying to keep him safe. One day Nemo pushes his boundaries too far and is snatched up by a diver and put in a fish tank in a dentist's office. The rest of the movie is about Marlin trying to find Nemo and Nemo trying to escape.The animation in this film was stunning. At times, especially in the shipyard scenes, I actually forgot it wasn't a live action film that I was watching.The storyline is pretty humorous. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect as Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. The scenes in the dentist office are also funny, even if they do make you not want to have your teeth cleaned anytime soon.Just a warning, even though the film is rated G, there are some moments that can traumatize young children, starting at the point early in the movie when Marlin loses his family. There are other scary moments along the way that may not be suitable for young children.

After fourteen year old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered, she goes to heaven where she is able to look down at her family and friends and the rest of the world. As she is adjusting to life in heaven and making friends there, she is also watching her family deal with her disappearance. She watches as both her parents struggle to accept the fact that she is gone and the affect it has on their marriage; she watches her younger sister Lindsay grow and become stronger as a person; and she watches her little brother Buckley, who is too young to understand what is going on. She also watches her friends Ray Singh and Ruth Connors, as they grow closer after Susie's death. As Susie watches her family and friends grow older and mature, she begins to realize how much she has lost and longs for one more chance for life on earth."The Lovely Bones" is a sad, moving, and at times odd novel. Extremely well written by Alice Sebold, it is told in the first person by Susie. This unique perspective means that we not only have insight into what Susie was like as a person, but who her killer was and how frustrating it is for her to not only watch the killer stalk other victims (including someone close to Susie) but watch the police try and find her body and determine who her killer is and prove it. Her ability to look down from heaven to see her family and others (and somehow be privy to their thoughts) adds poignancy to the novel, as each of her family members and friends struggle to cope with their loss in their own private ways. It is heartbreaking to read about how Susie's disappearance and the inability of the police to find her body affects her parents marriage, and how Susie begins to realize she didn't know them, especially her mother, all that well. It's equally heartbreaking to see Susie watch her sister Lindsay grow up and experience things that Susie never will, especially falling in love and having sex for the first time. Sebold makes the characters so believable that at times I wanted to hug them and say "I'm sorry" and at other times I wanted to shake them and make them aware of how their actions were hurting others. Although the book is sad, it's not as depressing as I thought it would be and there are some humorous moments in the book, mostly with Susie's Grandma Lynn. While I thought "The Lovely Bones" was well written for the most part, there was a truly odd section towards the end that felt out of place in the book."The Lovely Bones" is a moving novel about love and loss.

In this take on the Cinderella story, as a baby, Ella of Frell was given the "gift" of obedience by a fairy. This causes all kinds of complications, as Ella must literally do what she is told, so if someone tells her to hold her tongue, she grabs it and holds it. Things get worse when her father marries and his new wife and daughters discover that Ella has to do whatever they tell her to do. When her stepsister, Hattie, forces her to shoplift, Ella is desperate to get help, and, armed with a talking book, she sets out to find Lucinda, the fairy that gave her this "gift". Along the way, Ella meets Prince Charmont (Char) and the two fall in love. This causes all kinds of complications, as Char is about to become King, but his uncle, Prince Edward, who unbeknownst to Char, killed Char's father, and will do anything he can to stop Char from becoming King. When he discovers Ella has to do whatever he says, he decides to use her to help him kill Char. Ella needs to find out how to lose the gift of obedience before it's too late.This was a silly, goofy little movie and I loved every minute of it! It effortlessly mixes elements of classic fairy tales - fairies, giants, elves, ogres, and enchanted books - with modern touches such as a shopping mall with wooden staircases that move like escalators and modern song and dance routines. There are a lot of clever touches; one of my favorites is when Hattie has Ella shoplift glass slippers. Ella is a strong heroine even with the gift of obedience. She knows what is right and wrong and isn't afraid to speak out about it, telling Char he needs to tell his uncle to stop mistreating the elves, ogres, and giants.The actors in this movie seem to be having a lot of fun with their parts. Anne Hathaway is perfect as Ella, very spirited and with a smile that can light up a room; Hugh Dancy is a handsome Prince Char; Cary Elwes is comically evil as Char's uncle. Minnie Driver is good but wasted in a small role that seems to exist only to give Ella the enchanted book.This was a light, fluffy movie that was fun to watch.

After I spent a small fortune having my yard relandscaped, my landscaper told me the lawn mower I had would not work with my new lawn. The retail stores had a limited selection of electric lawn mowers, which is what I really wanted, so I ordered this one from Amazon. I was a bit apprehensive about having to put it together, but it was very easy to set up, I just had to straighten out the handle and tighten the screws. The grass catcher, however, was a little difficult to put together. The grass catcher is big and it is difficult to empty the grass into the paper lawn waste bags we have to use. I often had to juggle the grass catcher and bag, spilling some of the grass which left grass stains on my clothes. While the grass catcher is big, it doesn't hold that much grass and if you have a big yard you have to stop often to empty the grass out. My yard isn't all that big and it took me almost three hours to mow the front, back, and side lawns. The weight of the lawn mower is 50 pounds and it might be hard for some to move around. The height adjustment was up higher than on most lawn mowers, which makes it easier to change the height. The lawn mower does a nice, even job of cutting the grass.Despite the problems with the grass catcher, the lawn mower was easy to use and I recommend it.

Upset when she breaks up with her boyfriend, FBI agent Dutch Rivers, on Valentine's Day, the last thing psychic Abby Cooper wants to do is go to a wedding. But her friend Ellie, who lives in Colorado, needs her - one of her bridesmaids has dropped out of the wedding and gone to California to find her ex-boyfriend. Abby agrees to fill in as bridesmaid, thinking the change will do her good. But Abby's psychic intuition tells her that the missing bridesmaid, Gina, is dead and she works with Ellie's sheriff brother Duffy to find out what happened to her. Unfortunately, the chief suspect seems to be Ellie's fianc&eacute; Eddie and it doesn't help that Abby is getting psychic visions of him being in jail. When Gina's body is found and more bridesmaids turn up missing, Abby and Duffy realize that someone is willing to do anything, even murder, to stop Ellie's wedding. Abby continues to help Duffy investigate the case, but she needs to be careful as she is now having visions of her own death."Killer Insight" starts off with a bang - literally - and immediately hooks the reader. Abby is a unique heroine, strong-willed and brave (even recklessly going after a suspected kidnapper) yet insecure in her relationship with both Dutch and her cold, uncaring parents. Dutch isn't in the book much, but Duffy is interchangeable with him, so interchangeable in fact, that I sometimes forgot he wasn't Dutch. The other supporting characters are well done, especially Ellie's elderly aunt Viv, a very funny character who has a penchant for filling her large pocketbook with anything she finds - forks and knives from restaurants, soap from restrooms, etc. Abby's sister Cat is a nice character and her young sons are bratty but funny - one of funniest parts of the book is when Abby and Cat are talking bout sex and the boys decide they want to play the "sex game". The psychic elements are well done and believable and author Victoria Laurie does a great job explaining how the psychic mind works from Abby preparing to do a reading to how Abby is able to tell if someone is dead by looking at their picture to how Abby can pick up someone's energy by touching jewelry and other objects. Laurie also has what can only be described as a unique view of death that is also well done. The mystery is well plotted with plenty of suspects and readers will have a hard time figuring out who the murder is."Killer Insight" is another winner from Victoria Laurie.

Flower Shop owner Abby Knight is asked to deliver a black rose to Professor Puffer, who terrorized her during her brief time as a law school student. Abby is hoping to drop off the rose and run, but much to her dismay she runs into not only Puffer but another law professor, Carson Reed, who not too long ago had Abby arrested at an animal rights protest. Both men bully Abby into fleeing the building, but she decides to stand up for herself and goes back inside only to find that Professor Reed has been murdered. Plenty of people heard Abby's fight with Reed and she is a chief suspect in his murder and there's a real chance she'll be arrested. While Abby fights to clear her name, she stumbles upon a series of pet nappings and is convinced the two are related. But can she and hunky ex-cop Marco find the real murderer and pet nappers before she is arrested for murder?This was a nicely plotted cozy mystery. Although I've read many mysteries where the heroine is considered a suspect, this is the first one I've read where the situation wasn't contrived and there was a legitimate reason for the police to suspect Abby. Abby is an engaging heroine, although there were times in this book when her meddling was a bit too much and once or twice I rolled my eyes while reading the book. The book has lots of humor and Abby's various disguises as she hides from the Media and various townspeople who think she is the murderer are quite humorous. The mystery is well written and I didn't guess who the real murderer was until the very end.Very enjoyable.

Ophelia Jensen has built a wall around her heart ever since a close friend was murdered four years ago. Considering she has psychic powers, this wall is not easy to maintain, especially since her grandmother, Abby, is a witch who keeps urging Ophelia to embrace her gift. Ophelia has been able to resist Abby so far, but her resolve is threatened by a series of events. Handsome stranger Rick Davis arrives in town, claiming to be a chemical salesman, but asking far too many questions about the rash of fertilizer thefts the town has been experiencing. Ophelia doesn't trust him and does her best to avoid him, but he's persistent, and they are drawn together when Ophelia discovers a dead body. Already plagued by nightmares that may be related to the dead man, Ophelia wants nothing further to do with Rick. But, as Abby keeps reminding her, this is fate and she has no choice. As events unfold Ophelia finds out that her town and the people living there are not what she thought they were.When I bought "Witch Way to Murder", I thought it would be a light, frothy read, sort of the book equivalent of "Bewitched". Instead, it was a complex and rewarding book. Ophelia is a great character, so intent on not getting hurt again that the walls she's built inside have kept her from really knowing people, like her coworker Darci. Ophelia's past is slowly revealed throughout the course of the book, so readers learn why she is the way she is, just as she herself does. Abby is another good character, content in who she is and not caring what other people think. I found Rick, with his incessant questions to be annoying at first, but he grew on me as a character once his true reason for being in town was revealed. The magick that Abby (and Ophelia to a lesser extent) perform is totally believable, as is Ophelia's struggle to accept her gifts and her past. The mystery itself is a bit darker than in most cozy mysteries, but pretty easy to figure out, since it's obvious from the beginning who the bad guys are. But that's fine, it's the characters that drive this book and make it worth reading.Well done!

"The Hungry Ocean" written by Swordfish Captain Linda Greenlaw, details one of her 30 day swordfishing expeditions. Greenlaw describes the preparations she makes before leaving on the trip; the personalities of the men accompanying her on the trip; how she decides where they are going to do the actual fishing; the fishing itself and the equipment used; how she decides when the fishing trip is over; and finally, shows a receipt detailing the money spent on the trip and how much money each fisherman made. Interspersed with the details of this particular trip are chapters called "Mug-Up" with anecdotes of past fishing trips."The Hungry Ocean" is a fascinating read. Greenlaw doesn't dwell on the fact that she is a female working in a job dominated by men. She provides detailed explanations of what needs to be done on board to prepare for the fishing, although she sometimes lost me in describing some of the details. I wish pictures had been included of some of the equipment she used. Greenlaw also describes how she deals with the inevitable problems that come up when a number of sleep deprived people are working together in a cramped space for a long period of time.One of the best parts of the book are the small details Greenlaw includes: how they cook and prepare food on a moving boat, eating off Pyrex pie plates to keep the food from falling off; the practical jokes they play on new fishermen to break the boredom; and the various superstitions fishermen have. For the most part, Greenlaw comes across as likable, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for the fish as she describes their struggle once captured. Still, I don't begrudge the fishermen; it's a tough and dangerous way to make a living."The Hungry Ocean" is a very compelling read.

Jimmy MacElroy and Chazz Michael Michaels are long-time figure skating rivals. They are complete opposites - Jimmy was adopted by a man who trained him from a young age to be a champion and is germophobic; Chazz is a boozing sex addict. For the most part, their rivalry is only on the ice, but when they get into a fist fight at a competition they are both banned from skating for life. When a loophole is discovered that will allow them to skate together as pairs, they try to put their rivalry aside to compete again. But not only do they have to try to get along, at least on the ice, they have to deal with their main rivals, brother and sister team Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg who will stop at nothing in their quest for gold."Blades of Glory" is a silly, goofy, at times raunchy comedy. It pokes fun at both skating (the costumes, music, routines) and its fans (who act more like they are at a football game instead of a skating competition), but it's not all that edgy. In fact, while Jon Heder at times plays Jimmy as being a bit effeminate, the movie skates around the issue of homosexuality in figure skating by making Chazz a sex addict usually surrounded by several women and giving Jimmy a female love interest. None of the movie is meant to be taken seriously and figure skating purists should ignore everything the movie gets wrong about figure skating (perhaps intentionally). None of the actors are going for Academy awards in this movie and much of the acting (and action) is over the top, but all of the actors seem to be having fun, especially Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. The skating aspects are so-so (no doubt due to the limitations of the cast) but I wish the movie had shown more of the JFK/Marilyn Monroe routine - that could have been hilarious. There are a lot of real life figure skaters in the movie although most of them - Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, Sasha Cohen, and Nancy Kerrigan - have brief cameos. Scott Hamilton is a riot playing himself announcing the pairs competition."Blades of Glory" is funny, but definitely not for a younger audience as it is full of raunchy humor including throwing up after drinking and plenty of crotch shots.

After the mysterious disappearance of their parents, 11-year-old Sabrina Grimm and her 7-year-old sister, Daphne, are sent to a succession of foster homes. Their luck seems to change when they are sent to live with someone claiming to be their grandmother, but Sabrina is suspicious since her father had led her to believe her grandparents were all dead. She is further suspicious when her grandmother tells her that they are related to the Brothers Grimm of fairy tale fame. Not only that, but she tells them that fairy tales are not make believe, but history books and the characters are real and living right there in town. Naturally, Sabrina doesn't believe a word of it, until she sees with her own eyes that fairy tales can come true.This was a truly delightful fantasy. Michael Buckley deftly weaves many fairy tales into the book from the Three Little Pigs to the Magic Mirror on the Wall to the Wizard of Oz. He's taken one of the standard fairy tale characters, Prince Charming, and turned him into a vain, yet very funny character. Buckley has a nice touch with words that will help adults enjoy this book as well as children. His touch is subtle, yet humorous, as when he describes parking valets as "hulking attendants with green skin and oversized muscles". Sabrina and Daphne are delightful, resourceful and brave. Buckley's take on the various fairy tale characters and their personalities is quite interesting and readers will never look at fairy tales such as Jack and the Beanstalk in quite the same way after reading this book.Readers young and old will love this book.

92 year old Victoria Trumbull is out for a walk with her granddaughter when she spots a body. The police say the death was caused by an accidental fall off a cliff, but Victoria thinks someone murdered her neighbor. She is convinced the murder has something to do with the debate over whether or not to have a casino on Martha's Vineyard, where she lives. When a friend disappears and is presumed dead after a house fire, Victoria is determined to find out the truth. Add in a motorcycle rally, a stolen computer, and a kidnapping and Victoria is one busy lady."Indian Pipes" is an enjoyable mystery. Victoria is a great creation - at 92 she is sharp as a tack, energetic, stubborn, and a deputy assisting police chief Casey O'Neill. Her granddaughter Elizabeth is also well written - recovering from a divorce, she would like her grandmother to be more politically correct, not realizing how open to today's world Victoria really is. Author Cynthia Riggs does a good job of capturing life on Martha's Vineyard and the gambling plot line is a timely one as casinos are indeed being talked about in Massachusetts. The mystery aspects are nicely done and there are plenty of suspects to keep readers guessing who the murderer is. Besides the murder, there are also several smaller mysteries in the book that are all well developed and Riggs nicely takes her time in letting readers know the solution."Indian Pipes" is a nice cozy mystery.

When Gladdy Gold's neighbor, Selma Beller, dies, Gladdy is saddened, but not concerned, at 75 and living in a retirement community, Gladdy is accustomed to death. But when her best friend Francie dies, Gladdy is heartbroken and begins to be suspicious since both Selma and Francie died around the time of their birthdays. Gladdy tries to convince the police that murder may have taken place, but they don't believe her so she starts investigating on her own. After two more deaths and a couple of autopsies that show the victims were poisoned, the police finally believe Gladdy. But will they be able to catch the murderer before Gladdy becomes the next victim?"Getting Old is Murder" is a nice, humorous first entry in what looks to be an enjoyable cozy mystery series. Gladdy is a wonderful creation, very funny and still full of life (and romance) at 75. Her friends are all well written, with a nice touch of humor that makes them seem real but doesn't poke fun at the elderly. Each character stands out as an individual: the wisecracking Hy and his wife Lois; Gladdy's sister Evvie, a movie critic; Sophie with her slightly off-kilter cliches ("you're a broken record, play another"); Harriet who is young but lives there to take care of her elderly mother, Esther); Enya who never got over the loss of her family during the Holocaust; and Denny, the mentally slow handyman. Although the book is a cozy mystery and the elderly don't hesitate to solve the crime, it also shows the real problems of getting old, especially in the bittersweet case of Irving struggling to take care of his wife who has Alzheimer's. All of these characters are well written and come alive on the page.The mystery itself is nicely done with some neat red herrings and when the murderer is finally revealed, there is a real motive behind the slayings. There are some minor flaws - Francie's death is well telegraphed (it's never a good sign when the heroine in a mystery wonders what she'd do if something happened to her best friend!). There's also some minor editing errors, such as when Gladdy remembers dropping a friend off at the dentist when she never did so. Not a major error, but enough to stop the flow of the story for a second or two. Rita Lakin takes you into the victim's minds as they are dying, which I found unsettling in a cozy mystery.But these are indeed minor flaws and this is a very enjoyable, funny cozy mystery. It's worth buying just to read the scene in which Gladdy convinces a gang of teenagers to help her break into her car after she locks her keys in it. One of the funniest scenes I've ever read!

While trying to protect a bookie, Hawk is shot and nearly killed by the Ukrainian mob. The mob also kills the bookie and all the members of his family except for his youngest son who was in day care at the time. It will take Hawk quite a while to recover from his injuries, but when he does, he vows to kill each member of the mob, plus the ringleader. He'll have plenty of help from Spenser and some other familiar faces, but before he does, he wants to make sure the bookie's young son is taken care of financially for the rest of his life.Robert Parker's Spenser books are fun but frustrating at times to read. The fun part comes with the witty dialogue between the characters, especially Spenser and Hawk (and there's a lot of Hawk in this book). The city of Boston itself is a character, and it's easy for Bostonians to imagine Hawk, Spenser and Susan actually walking down the city streets. The books are always exciting, quick reads. The frustrating part is that Spenser and his long time love, Susan Silverman, seem to have the same conversations in every Spenser book as Susan insists on analyzing both Spenser and Hawk. After so many years together, she should know by now that Spenser is who he is and Hawk is, well, Hawk is Hawk.I have not read "Small Vices" (although it looks like I should) so I was a bit lost as to who The Gray Man was and what part he played in Spenser's past. Also, the book is a chapter too long, Parker should have ended it with the scene at the shopping mall, which would have been a perfect ending, rather than yet another conversation between Spenser and Susan about Spenser and Hawk's actions.Fans of Robert Parker will enjoy this book, as long as they don't expect anything new.

For years hysterectomies have been the "solution" for fibroids preferred by most doctors but that is changing and "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibroids" examines new techniques and therapies to treat fibroids including alternatives to hysterectomy. The book covers what fibroids are; how they are diagnosed; managing symptoms; watchful waiting; diet; exercise; stress; alternative medicines; drug treatment; options such as uterine fibroid embolization, myomectomy, and hysterectomy; and future treatment options. There is also a bibliography, a list of additional resources (books, organizations and websites) and an index.I wish "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibroids" had been published when I was first diagnosed with fibroids. It is very informative and helps women understand what fibroids are and how to treat them (or in some cases not treat them). There are a lot of charts and lists throughout the book that are very helpful as they explain things such as facts about fibroids; risk factors for fibroids; fibroid sizes; symptoms of fibroids; a list of exercises; and some menu plans. Everything is explaining in layman's terms so nothing is too confusing to read.One of the things that impressed me about the book is that it was written by a gynecologist and a radiologist, both men, who have an amazing grasp about the effect fibroids can have on a woman's life. I also liked the fact that even though there were some treatments they didn't agree with or recommend, they explained all aspects of treatments evenhandedly, giving the reader a chance to make up her mind. All the chapters in the book are excellent and the chapters on three procedures available (Uterine Fibroid Embolization, Myomectomy, and Hysterectomy) are especially well done. Each chapter describes the pros and cons of each procedure, when it is the best option, and how to prepare for each procedure and what to expect afterwards. I had a UFE in 2002 and I wish I had this book back then to prepare for my hospital stay.This book was published in 2003 and I was surprised at how up to date it is - the authors even mentioned one of the newest (and still fairly rare) treatments - High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFUS). The authors clearly know their stuff."What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibroids" is highly informative and I recommend it for women who are looking for an alternative treatment to fibroids besides a hysterectomy.

Phoebe's not happy about deceiving Doctor Lucius van Someren and is relieved when he tells her he knows who she really is. Phoebe settles into her job and soon falls in love with Lucius. But Lucius's adopted son, Paul, is hostile towards her, as is Maureen his governess, who will do anything she can to keep Phoebe away from Lucius. Will Lucius realize what's going on before it's time for Phoebe to return to London?Betty Neels' romances are always a delight to read and "Three for a Wedding" is no exception. Phoebe is a delight, beautiful, sweet, but strong enough to stand up to Maureen, who has no redeeming qualities. Lucius is the typical handsome, rich Dutch doctor that Neels loved to write about, although readers will wonder why he puts up with Maureen for so long. Young Paul is the most realistic and sympathetic character; although he plays a mean trick on Phoebe, it's clear he's not a bad child, but afraid he'll lose Lucius who took him in after his parents died."Three for a Wedding" is yet another winner from Betty Neels!

After working in a church in Boston and another in Washington, D.C., minister Ed Wilcox and his family have transferred to the Consolidated Community Church in Emerald Springs, Ohio. His wife, Aggie, initially has her doubts about settling down in a small town, but eventually she, Ed, and their two young children find themselves making friends, except for elderly parishioner Gelsey Falowell who despises Ed and wants to get rid of him. Gelsey's wish may come true when the naked body of a murder victim is left on the Wilcox's front porch and Ed, who had been counseling the dead woman, is the chief suspect. Aggie knows that Ed is innocent but wonders why Ed is keeping secrets from her especially when her daughter Teddy tells her she saw her father fighting with the dead woman. When a second murder is committed and detective Kirkor Roussos seems to suspect Ed committed both crimes, Aggie, with the help of her friend, real estate agent Lucy Jacobs, begins investigating the murders. The more Aggie looks into the crimes the more she realizes that people, especially Gelsey, have secrets that have been buried for years and some people will kill to have them remain secret."Blessed is the Busybody" is a good beginning to what looks to be a good mystery series. The characters are well written and well defined. The mystery is written from the view point of Aggie, revealing various bits of her unconventional childhood, plus her struggles to raise her children especially oldest daughter Deena, who at eleven is just starting to rebel a little bit. Both Teddy and Deena are well written and come across as real children. Aggie's friend Lucy is so well written that I could picture here while reading the book. Ed comes across as a bit bland, but I suspect that will change in future books. Author Emilie Richards does a good job describing small town life and the secrets hidden there and the town itself was like a character in the book. The mystery is well written with plenty of surprising secrets slowly revealed as the book goes on. The mystery is complex yet satisfying, if a bit sad. But there's a nice gentle humor throughout the book that takes the edge off the sadder elements."Blessed is the Busybody" is well worth reading.

"The King of Kong" is a classic look at good vs. evil as Steve Wiebe challenges Billy Mitchell for the Donkey Kong title that Mitchell has held for years. Wiebe comes across as a lovable, devoted family man who starts playing Donkey Kong when he loses his job and who just wants to be a winner for once. Mitchell comes across as a bit arrogant, wanting to hold on to his title as champ, refusing to meet with Wiebe in a face to face challenge, even as he emphasizes the importance of "live" scores."The King of Kong" is a fascinating look into the world of classic game competition. You can't help but end up cheering for Wiebe and hating Mitchell as the movie goes along. This is partly due to the somewhat controversial editing that shows Wiebe at home, surrounded by family, trying and failing to meet with Mitchell, and willing to show up in public to challenge the title. On the other hand, you only catch brief glimpses inside Mitchell's home, an even briefer glimpse of his wife, and when he does meet up with Wiebe, he basically ignores him. His unwillingness (at least at that time of the documentary) to defend his record in public is perplexing, especially since he stresses throughout the documentary how important it is to do it "live". His sending a videotape of him setting a record in Donkey Kong to Funspot while Wiebe is competing live is one of the more infuriating things he does in the documentary as is Walter Day's decision to use the score on the tape even though he had questions about the tape (to be fair, "The King of Kong" neglects to mention that Mitchell's score was soon taken down).What makes "The King of Kong" so interesting is how important the record in Donkey Kong is to both Wiebe and Mitchell. It's clear that Mitchell loves the "fame" that comes with the title of Donkey Kong champ. But Wiebe is no less determined to gain the title, sometimes almost neglecting his children (the scene with him first breaking the score is both funny and sad as his children struggle to gain his attention). His young daughter has perhaps the most telling line in the documentary: "I never knew that the Guinness World Record Book was so... I never knew it was so important... Some people sort of ruin their lives to be in there." Also interesting are some of the other players who are also competing on various games (I would have loved to see more of the late Doris Self, the oldest video game competitor, who once set a world record in Q-Bert). The scene where Wiebe reaches a kill screen in Donkey Kong shows just how exciting competition can be not just to those playing the game, but those playing other games as well."The King of Kong" is a good, if not perfect documentary. The film plays with facts a little too much - the producers not only omit the bit about Mitchell's high score being quickly taken down, but the fact that Wiebe was not the first to seriously challenge Mitchell's records, there had been an earlier much disputed, record breaking score. The film also neglects to mention that even though Mitchell made it into the 2007 Guiness World Records for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Wiebe also is listed in Guinness for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Jr. There is also some dispute as to whether Wiebe and Mitchell did meet up, especially in a restaurant scene that is edited to look like Mitchell is avoiding Wiebe; and what exactly happened when people came to Wiebe's house to examine his Donkey Kong machine. Oddly enough, these omissions and disputed facts only serve to make the move even more interesting."The King of Kong" is a fascinating documentary.

"Wicked" is the story of the wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz books from her birth to her death. Divided into five sections, the book focuses on certain times in Elphaba's life: her early childhood; her college years; her political activism and her doomed love affair; her becoming a "witch"; and her final descent into madness and her accidental murder by Dorothy.Gregory Maguire has clearly not only seen "The Wizard of Oz" movie but read several of the books. Minor characters in "The Wizard of Oz" book, such as Boq, become major characters. There are nods to other characters in later Oz books such as the Tiktok man. He makes some interesting changes though. Glinda, the good Witch of the North, is the most surprising character as Maguire portrays her as vain, shallow, and, unlike in Baum's book, a good friend to Elphie. The Wizard, a humbug in the Oz novel and movie, is evil and manipulative. Animals, much loved and respected in the books, are separated into Animals (talking) and animals (non-talking) and are discriminated against."Wicked" is both a success and failure. The book succeeds at making Elphaba, the Wicked Witch, a sympathetic character, even as she is having an adulterous affair and engaging in terrorism. Her ill-fated love affair makes her especially sympathetic. Readers may protest at the dark way Maguire portrays the Land of Oz, but reading "Wicked" makes you realize that underneath the surface of L. Frank Baum's fairy-tale, Oz is filled with danger and evil characters.Where Maguire fails is explaining how a basically sympathetic character like Elphaba becomes regarded as a witch and feared by all. He gamely tries to explain how she got all her props and why she sends them to Dorothy: such as the bees (he never explains how she can talk to them); her wolves (dogs sent to guide Dorothy to the castle); and the winged monkeys (he tries to explain how they got their wings, but it doesn't work). The magic cap is regrettably left out. And while Elphie's aversion to water is mentioned throughout the entire book, it is never explained why she is allergic to water. Her final descent into total madness feels rushed and not quite believable."Wicked" is an interesting, if unsettling read for Wizard of Oz fans. Parents should be aware that there are multiple sexual themes that make this book unsuitable for children.

After being out of the public eye for several years, fashion designer Lottie Harmon is staging a comeback with a collection of coffee-inspired fashion accessories and chooses the Village Blend Coffeehouse as the perfect place to launch the collection. Claire Cosi, manager of the Village Blend, feels a bit out of place in the fashion world, but is thrilled with the turnout for the event. Thrilled that is, until one of the guests is killed by a poisonous latte and one of her baristas, Tucker, is arrested for the murder. The police think that Tucker is the murderer because the victim was his ex-boyfriend, but Clare thinks the poison was actually intended for Lottie. Clare has a hard time convincing anyone else of this, even Matteo, her ex-husband, thinks Tucker is guilty. Clare could let things go, she has other worries - she is afraid her daughter Joy is using drugs - but when Lottie becomes ill, Clare thinks the poisoner is at it again. As Clare searches for the killer she encounters blackmail, kidnapping, and the mob and discovers that not everyone is who they seem to be.Written by husband and wife team Marc Cerasini and Alice Alfonsi under the pen name Cleo Coyle, "Latte Trouble" is a well done mystery. Set in New York, the city makes a nice backdrop for the mystery and the city itself is like a character in the book. The fashion aspects in the book are well done and the descriptions of what the characters are wearing help the reader picture each character. Clare is a well written and real character - in her 40's, divorced but still attracted to her ex-husband, trying to run a busy business, and worried about her daughter. The supporting characters are equally well written, especially Matteo, Clare's ex-husband who is finally starting to grow up and his mother "Madame". The coffee making aspects are deftly weaved into the story, although much of it was over my head as I drink tea. The murder is well plotted, with plenty of suspects and the murderer is the last person I would have thought of. There are lots of surprises in the book, but careful reading shows the authors left plenty of subtle clues as to what was going on."Latte Trouble" is a great cozy mystery.

In this sequel to the hit movie, Shrek and Fiona travel to Far Far Away so Fiona's parents can meet Shrek. Shrek is reluctant to go realizing Fiona's parents won't be happy she married an Ogre and is now an Ogre herself. But things are even worse than Shrek imagined. Her parents wanted her to marry Prince Charming and her father hires an assassin to kill Shrek so the marriage can take place. Prince Charming and his mother, the fairy godmother, will do anything they can to win Fiona. Shrek begins to think that Fiona would be happier married to a "normal" man and is willing to sacrifice everything in order to make her happy.I thought this movie was even funnier than the first one. The addition of Puss in Boots is the main reason why I liked it so much. Antonio Banderas is perfect as the voice of Puss and the animators do a great job with the character. My favorite part of the animation is when Puss makes the sweet innocent look that cats do right before they attack. There are a ton of movie references in Shrek 2, so many, in fact, that I know I missed some. The "Mission Impossible" spoof was hilarious and the movie is worth watching for that scene alone. Some of the humor in the movie is a bit adult and not suitable for young children; but then again, they might not get the references.Highly recommended!

Emma Trent and Dr. Paul Wyatt meet when Emma's mother has a medical emergency and needs immediate surgery. They cross paths a few times after that. When Emma's life is turned upside down by tragedy, Paul offers to marry her, a marriage of convenience. Emma agrees even though she doesn't love Paul. Gradually she begins to fall in love with him, but what about his relationship with Diana, who is far more sophisticated and beautiful than Emma could ever hope to be?I'm not terribly fond of "marriage of convenience" romance novels, but Betty Neels pulls this off, mainly because she lets us know early on that Paul is in love with Emma and is willing to wait for Emma to fall in love with him. It's nice have some insight into his feelings and it's fun waiting for Emma to realize she has been in love with him all along!I love reading Betty Neels' books because I know what to expect when I read them: a nice, sweet romance. She never disappoints!

In this humorous first book in the "Passport to Peril" series by Maddy Hunter, Emily Andrews accompanies her grandmother on a tour of Switzerland with a group of senior citizens. The trip doesn't go as Emily expects; it's too foggy to see the scenery, the food stinks, and her hotel room (rooms) are awful. When a member of their tour dies, Emily thinks its just one more thing gone wrong. But the police suspect murder and when a second tour member turns up dead, they realize there's a killer on the loose. Soon Emily finds herself working with a sexy Swiss detective to solve the murders before she becomes a victim herself.Janet Evanovich fans will like this series. In fact, Hunter uses a lot of the same elements Evanovich does: a young heroine in need of a job takes one that she's not quite suited for; a running theme of her destroying something; a hot to trot grandmother; a sexy policeman as a love interest; lots of quirky characters; and lots and lots of humor. In fact, it's the laugh out loud humor, more than the mystery itself, that kept me reading the book and makes me want to read more books in the series.This is a good start to what looks to be a fun-filled series.

Nicely filmed in a beautiful location near the Pacific Ocean, "Yoga for Beginners" begins with an introduction by instructor Elena Brower explaining who she is, what the program will consist of, and what you will need to do the exercises (a yoga mat, bare feet, loose clothing, and a towel and water if you want). Once the introduction is over, the program starts with several minutes focussed on establishing your breathing. The program starts off slowly, picks up pace towards the middle, and slows down considerably towards the end with a nice long cool-down period. You have two viewing choices: watch the DVD from the beginning or select from five chapters: Breathing and Warm Up; Standing Poses/Sun Salute; Twists/Hip Opener; Back Bends; Forward Bends/Stretch.I've never done yoga before and I found "Yoga For Beginners" to have some good points and bad points for a true beginner. I loved the opening where you focus on your breathing (even if I tended to inhale when she says to exhale and vice versa); it was a good way of getting into the mood for the exercises. I also liked the way Brower introduced various yoga terms into the routine. She often returns to the downward facing dog or mountain pose positions so they quickly became familiar to me. Brower also has plenty of rest periods set into the routines. With the chapters options it's easy to forward to the cool down section if the exercises become too much for a beginner. And the cool-down section is wonderful and very relaxing.There were a couple of things I didn't like about the DVD. I had a hard time with the placement of the mat - I positioned it like Brower did which was initially fine, but she then moved to the front of the mat, which meant I had to keep turning my head sideways to see what she was doing which was very awkward. And, while the DVD is for beginners, and starts off nice and slow, it picks up pace as it goes along and became a bit too fast for this beginner. Still, I got the feeling that the more I practice with the DVD, the more I'll be able to do.With practice, beginners will enjoy "Yoga for Beginners".

Jane Jeffrey is struggling to rebuild her life and make her children's life as normal as possible after the death of her husband in a car accident seven months earlier. She feels that life is starting to get back to normal, but that normalcy is shattered when a cleaning woman is murdered at the house next door which belongs to her friend Shelley Nowack. Shelly and Jane are understandably upset about the murder and worry about the safety of their children, so even though the police are looking into the murder they begin a little investigating on their own. They have plenty of suspects - there was going to be a gathering at Shelley's house and people were in and out of the house dropping off food all day long. In fact, Jane even wonders if Shelley could be the killer. As Jane investigates, she realizes that several people had secrets they wanted to stay secret, secrets they could be blackmailed for and might even kill to keep secret. When Jane gets a little too close to the truth and a threatening note is left on her bed, she knows she has to solve the case quickly before she or someone in her family is hurt."Grime and Punishment" is the delightful first book in Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffrey cozy mystery series. Jane is a well-written character - a single mother struggling not only to raise three young children, but also trying to accept the circumstances behind her husband's death. Her children - Mike, Katie, and Todd - are also well written and some of the best parts of the book are the scenes with Jane and her children going about their every day life. I especially liked the fact that Jane volunteered to drive blind children, it added a nice dimension to her character. Jane's method of investigating the murder was a bit unorthodox, my jaw dropped when she came right out and asked a suspect why she was being blackmailed, but she quickly won my sympathy when her abruptness backfired on her and she learned something that hurt her. Shelley is also well written - attractive, a bit too perfect and bossy, living in a house that is immaculate before the cleaning lady even gets there, and a penchant for driving too fast. Of the supporting characters, my favorite is Jane's "Uncle" Jim, a policeman who is a surrogate father to Jane and will do anything he can to protect her. The mystery is well plotted and the number of people that had access to Shelley's house means that the readers will have fun trying to pick the killer from the long list of suspects and at the end of the book, readers will want to go back through it to see all the clues Churchill cleverly planted throughout. The method Churchill uses to reveal the killer is a bit unbelievable but still a lot of fun."Grime and Punishment" is a nice, fun cozy mystery.

Cedric Brown has just had another Nanny quit. His unruly brood of seven children drove her screaming out into the street and he is desperate to find a replacement. His scullery maid, Evangeline, does what she can to help, but Brown goes to the Nanny agency to find a full-time Nanny. However, no Nanny will work with the Brown family. Mr. Brown hears a mysterious voice telling him he needs to hire Nanny McPhee, so when she shows up at his doorstep, he is only too glad to offer her employment. Nanny McPhee has magical powers that she uses on the children, but that only solves one of Mr. Brown's problems. His late wife's Aunt Adelaide has been sending him money to help support the family, but she threatens to withhold the money unless Mr. Brown remarries quickly. Desperate to marry (and unable to recognize who he truly loves), Brown arranges to marry a truly obnoxious woman who threatens the happiness of the entire Brown family. But not to worry, Nanny McPhee still has some magic up her sleeve.Nanny McPhee is a very nice, enjoyable family film (although it will probably appeal more to women than men). The movie is a cross between "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music" (without the singing). It has lots of magic and silly goofy fun (as an adult I groaned at yet another food fight in a movie, but kids will love the scene). There's lot of eccentric characters, starting with Nanny McPhee herself and onto the cook, Aunt Adelaide, Mr. Brown's coworkers, and Mrs. Quickly, the would-be second Mrs. Brown. Kids will love the sight gags, especially the ones involving animals. Adults will appreciate running gags such as Nanny McPhee insisting "I did knock" each time she magically appears in a room.The actors all have fun with their parts. Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay) has particular fun as Nanny McPhee. Colin Firth is appropriately bewildered as Mr. Brown who has no control over his children or the women in his life. Angela Lansbury has great fun as nearly blind Aunt Adelaide. Kelly Macdonald is radiant as Evangeline, willing to do anything for Mr. Brown and his family. The child actors are all good. Thomas Sangster is a standout as the troublemaking Simon; but then again, his is the showiest role amongst the children.Highly recommended for family viewing.

A man and his young son are journeying across post-apocalyptic America hoping to get some place warm before next winter. Their journey will not be an easy one - it's every man for himself out there and they are constantly on the lookout for food and avoiding those that may kill them for any food they do find. In the end, the one thing they have all the time is their love for each other which helps keep them on The Road."The Road" is Cormac McCarthy's unrelentingly bleak yet extremely moving novel about post-apocalyptic America. McCarthy's view of a world almost all but destroyed by some unexplained event is a depressing one. Food is scarce; people are afraid to stay in one place for long and are constantly on the move; people have not banded together for the most part and will do whatever they can to get food; ash covers everything; there is no sunlight or moonlight; no animals besides a lone dog - there is, most of the time, just the man and his son (nameless throughout the book) on their endless walk. At some point while reading the book you will realize how long they have been walking and you question why they keep doing it.McCarthy's writing style is not for everyone. There are no chapters, no quotation marks, and punctuation is often omitted. He is deliberately vague about some events - briefly mentioning enough to help readers guess what has happened. There are some genuinely horrific images in the book that are hard to read. The book has no real beginning, middle, or end and no real plot. This would have been frustrating in a less gifted writer's hands, but McCarthy makes it work brilliantly. In a few words he has created an entire world (depressing as it may be) and two people that readers care about (for better or for worse). It's the type of novel where you wonder, both while reading it and long after finishing it, what you would do if faced with that type of situation."The Road" is a brilliantly written novel about the love between a father and son in a destroyed world.

"The Taking" is Dean Koontz's version of the end of the world. It focuses on a young couple, Molly and Neil Sloan, who wake up early one morning to a strange rainfall. Turning on their television, they soon realize that the whole world is under attack and they head into town to find other survivors. Along the way they encounter zombies, unnaturally large bugs, other unknown creatures lurking in trees, dolls that self-mutilate, UFO's, and a fungus that threatens to overtake everything. Molly determines that she was left alive to protect the surviving children, so she and Neil, along with the help of a dog that seems almost human, set out to find the children and start a new world, if they survive."The Taking" is the written equivalent of a B movie - you know it's really bad, but you can't stop reading it. Koontz focuses on one character - Molly - and consequently the other characters, including Neil, are nonentities and readers don't care what happens to them. It's hard to feel sympathetic for characters that are killed because you know nothing about them. And Molly herself is a one-dimensional character.The reason the characters are so one-dimensional is Koontz's writing. He spends too much time telling readers what is going on instead of showing them. A perfect example is what happened between Molly and her father when she was eight years old. Instead of bringing readers into the classroom with Molly and her father (which would have been a terrific way to open the book) Koontz tells readers what happened halfway through the book, in alternate paragraphs, as Molly encounters her father as an adult. The scene where Molly and Neil listen to the astronauts being attacked in space should have been especially frightening, the reader should have been able to imagine the horrors along with Molly and Neil but it just didn't work.Finally, Koontz didn't seem to know how to end the book. The last few pages seem rushed. The aliens simply leave and he glosses over the setting up of a new civilization by having all the corpses mysteriously disappear and mentioning that there was enough canned food to last for years. Conveniently enough, all the survivors were in useful professions - doctors, dentists, nurses, engineers, architects, carpenters and mechanics - all chosen for their talent. No policemen or firefighters are mentioned - Koontz seems to have created a perfect world.The description on the back of the book made the book sound really interesting, but the description was the best part of the book.

When attorney Jack Newlin discovers his murdered wife's body, he thinks his daughter killed her and he confesses rather than see her go to jail. He then hires inexperienced attorney Mary DiNunzio to defend him. But Mary believes he is innocent and decides to prove it, placing herself, Jack, and Jack's daughter, Paige, in danger. Can Mary find the killer before she becomes the next victim?This legal thriller is a fun read. The characters, for the most part, are well written and come to life, especially Mary and her family, although I got tired of reading about Mary's Catholic guilt complex. Jack, and his daughter, Paige, are also well written, Paige especially, who, as a teen model, could have been a clich&eacute;, but instead she is a sad, complex, character. The secondary characters are also well developed, especially Lou and cops Brinkley and Kovich. The plot had enough twists and turns that the identity of the real murderer was a complete surprise.This is a good book for fans of legal thrillers.

Wii Play features nine games for one or two players (it comes with a Wii remote) that you play using the Mii you created for the Wii. The first time you play you have to play each game in order; after that you can pick and choose which games you want to play.Shooting Range: a quick easy game where you shoot targets as they appear on the screen (try to avoid hitting your own Mii). Targets include items like balloons, flying saucers, and cans. Shoot five or more targets in a row without missing any for bonus points. If you are playing by yourself you can use two remotes for an added challenge.Find Mii: there are several segments of this including picking your own Mii out of a crowd of Miss; find two Miss is that look-alike; or find the one different Mii in a crowd of look-alikes. This is actually a pretty challenging game especially as you move on to higher levels.Table Tennis: the first player to get 11 points wins. There is nothing much to say about this game - it is a regular table tennis game. It is a bit more fun to play with two people as opposed to a single player game against the Wii.Pose Mii: you have to change your Mii's pose to one of three poses, matching a silhouette in a bubble. A bubble falling off the screen is considered a miss; three misses ends the game in a single player game (in a two player game the player with the higher score at the end wins). This is one of my least favorite games - there is some hand eye coordination involved but basically it is a waste of time.Laser Hockey: in this game (which reminds me of air hockey) you try to score goals against your opponent while defending your own goal. This isn't a great single player game as the Wii remote doesn't work all that well. It is slightly better as a two player game but not one of my favorites.Billiards: this is a fun game that can take some time to play. I'm not the most coordinated person in the room and had some problems learning how to work the Wii remote to play this but once I adjusted I really enjoyed this game.Fishing: in this game you try to catch as many fish as possible for a high score (there are bonus fish for more points). This is kind of a mindless game but is one of my favorites in Wii Play.Charge!: in this game you head for goal line while riding a cow, knocking scarecrows down along the way. This game is a good test of your balance and coordination. It can be a tough game but is one of the most addicting games in this collection.Tanks!: This is the only game in this collection where you can use a nunchuk (if you wish) as you play. You steer your tanks while firing shells and dropping mines at enemy tanks. The game stops when you run out of tanks. This was not my favorite game - I had problems steering my tank and shooting the enemy tanks. I've yet to score points while playing this game.Wii Play has some fun games and some not so fun games. In the end I think it is worth buying not just for the extra remote (which is a nice bonus) but because there are a few games that are fun to play on a lazy afternoon.

Charlie Bone is worried about his friend, Billy Raven. Billy, an albino and an orphan, has longed for a family of his own and it seems like his wish has come true when Mr. and Mrs. de Grey agree to adopt him. Charlie is happy for Billy, but the de Grey's are friends of the Bloor family and Charlie doesn't trust them. Charlie is right to be worried - the de Grey's have powers that literally won't let Billy leave the house unless he is going to school. Charlie, his Uncle Paton, and his friends all try to find a way to get Billy out of the de Grey's house and to a place where he'll be safe. Charlie also wonders what is going on at his school Bloor's Academy. Piano teacher Mr. Pilgrim is gone and his replacement, Tantalus Ebony, is a bit odd. Charlie also wonders what's up with a new student, Joshua Tilpin, who seems to be magnetic. Charlie also wonders why his friend Olivia is acting so strange. On top of it all, Charlie keeps searching for his missing father."Charlie Bone and the Castle of Mirrors" certainly has its good points. For one thing, some of the children grow as characters, especially Billy and Olivia. Author Jenny Nimmo also shows some increasing aspects of Charlie's ability to read the thoughts of people in photographs and pictures. There's a nice sense of humor throughout the book, with some punny word play and an especially funny scene at the Pet's Caf&eacute;. The fantasy elements are nicely done, especially the introduction of Alice Angel, and a wonderfully imaginative scene involving written oaths coming alive and attacking Charlie and his friends. The "flames" as always, add much to the fantasy elements.However, the book has its flaws. While some characters are well developed, other characters aren't developed at all. Once again Nimmo awkwardly gets rid of characters without any real explanation as to why they are gone. New characters that are added are underdeveloped, especially Joshua Tilpin and Tantalus Ebony. With the exception of Uncle Paton, most of the "good" adults are once again useless, especially Charlie's mother, Amy. Charlie's life at school is not particularly well-written - it's not clear what classes he takes and what classes many of the teachers actually teach. One plotline - losing balance - was very interesting, but felt thrown in at the last moment and could have been much more developed. The ongoing plot line of Charlie looking for his father could have been plotted and written better since it's obvious who his father really is.The Children of the Red King series is a quick, at times enjoyable read, but continues to be somewhat frustrating.

As the third season of "Land of the Lost" opens, an earthquake strikes just as Rick Marshall opens a time doorway. Before his children, Will and Holly, can reach him, he falls through and the doorway closes. Will and Holly aren't alone for long as they find their Uncle Jack has landed in the Land of the Lost while looking for them. They soon discover the earthquake has destroyed the cave they were living in and take refuge in a temple, along with Chaka, the only Pakuni to survive the earthquake. The Marshalls have to deal with their old nemesis the Sleestaks, fight off dinosaurs including Torchy, a fire breathing dinosaur, and various other threats, all while trying to reach home.The third and last season of "Land of the Lost" was very disappointing. The loss of Spencer Milligan as Rick Marshall was a shame, although Ron Harper did a good job as Uncle Jack. But the show was sloppy overall. Gone were such creative characters like the Zarn from season two. Instead, the writers threw in a series of unbelievable visitors to the Land of the Lost: Medusa, the Abominable Snowman, and the Flying Dutchman to name just a few. These visitors seem to have no problem escaping from the Land of the Lost, although the Marshalls have been looking for a way to get out for years. Holly even gets a pet unicorn and bakes a cake in one episode - where'd she get the ingredients? Chaka is now a regular character and can speak perfect English, with no explanation why. Most of the episodes focused on the Sleestaks blaming anything and everything on the Marshalls and saying they must be destroyed. Wesley Eure sang at the end of a few episodes, seemingly backed by a full orchestra.Also disappointing is the lack of extras. Outside of some stuff with Ron Harper there aren't any extras. It would have been fun to hear Wesley Eure's and Kathy Coleman's thoughts on the third season as their commentary on some of the episodes was one of the highlights of the DVDs from the first and second seasons.There are a couple of good episodes from the third season, notably "Timestop" and "Scarab", but most of Season Three of "Land of the Lost" is a disappointment.

Desperate for money and about to lose her house, Bridget Cardigan takes a janitorial job at the Federal Reserve. As she watches worn out currency being shredded, she hatches a seemingly fool proof scheme to steal the money. To do so, she'll need some help from her coworkers Nina Brewster and Jackie Truman. The scheme works, but the three and their significant others need to be careful and avoid being caught with their "Mad Money"."Mad Money" is a funny, enjoyable if at times unbelievable movie. From the beginning of the movie you know the three get caught (which does take away some of the suspense) so the fun is in watching them cook up the scheme, how it works, and how it backfires on them. The way they get away with stealing the money is unrealistic, but anyone who has ever dreamed of getting rich quick will cheer on the three women. While the movie is largely from Bridget's viewpoint, I found that while her attempts to reenter the work world made her a sympathetic character, her greediness made her an unlikable character at times. Nina was the best written character - a single mother who wants the best for her children, but afraid of letting the stealing go on too long, she is the moral compass of the group. Jackie was the least well written of the three - very little is shown of her home life and you're never really sure of her motivation to join the other two. It's nice to see strong roles for women and all three actresses (Diane Keaton as Bridget, Queen Latifah as Nina, and Katie Holmes as Jackie) nail their parts. The supporting cast (Ted Danson as Keaton's husband; Adam Rothenberg as Holmes's husband; Roger Cross as a security guard more than a little interested in Latifah; and Stephen Root) are all good."Mad Money" is a lot of fun.

Clare Cosi, manager of The Village Blend coffeehouse, arrives at work one day and finds her Assistant Manager, Annabelle Hart, unconscious at the bottom of the basement stairs. The police say it was an unfortunate accident, but Clare isn't convinced and starts investigating on her own. She also has to deal with her crafty ex-mother-in-law, Madame (owner of The Village Blend) who keeps throwing Clare back together with her ex-husband, Matteo, Madame's son. Clare is also attracted to Homicide Detective Lieutenant Quinn, who may be married. On top of all that, Annabelle's mother is threatening to sue The Village Blend - Clare certainly has her hands full! Clare needs to convince the police that someone was trying to kill Annabelle, before she becomes the next victim."On What Grounds" isn't a bad beginning for the first mystery in an ongoing series. Claire is an engaging heroine and it's nice to have a strong woman character that's nearer to 40 than 20. The supporting characters are great; I could especially picture "Madame" as I was reading the book. Clare's ex-husband, Matteo, is also well written, although I would have liked to know more about what he was like in the past.The setting of New York really comes alive. The reference to 9/11 is especially touching. I realize the book is set in a coffee house, but the frequent references on how to make the perfect cup of coffee felt forced, almost as if they were quoted from a book. The narrator (Clare) comes across as a bit of a snob at times, not only in reference to the coffee people drink, but the clothes and jewelry they wear.All in all, not a bad beginning to the series.

Leslie Sansone's "Walk and Jog" is thirty minutes of a mixture of low impact and high impact exercising. It combines the four basic steps that Leslie always uses - walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, and kicking - with four jogging intervals. For those who feel the jogging intervals are too much, there is one person who does a walking routine instead of jogging so you can follow her if you want to. According to Leslie, the workout is equivalent to a 2 mile walk, although the pedometer I wore said two miles at the end of the program.While I'm a huge Leslie Sansone fan and have been doing her one and two mile walks for some time, I was afraid "Walk and Jog" would be a little too intense an exercise routine for me. I was pleasantly surprised. The jogging intervals are nicely spaced apart and combine jogging back and forth with either kicks or leg swings. The transition from walking to jogging is smoothly done - you walk up two and back two and gradually turn that into jogging back and forth. When the jogging interval is done, you jog forward and backward gradually turning the jogging back into walking up two and back two. The kicks and side swings done during the jogging interval add a lot of fun to the routine. The jogging intervals are not as varied as I would have liked, but they last just long enough. I did vary some of the routine (lunges) when I thought it was more than I could handle. As always, Leslie adds in arm movements throughout the routine for a total body workout.I'm a huge Leslie fan, but I'll be the first to admit her exercise DVD's aren't always perfect. She can be off in her count, she sometimes tells you to do the wrong thing (for example, she says to kick when she means to do knee lifts), and her advise on how to hydrate before exercising takes place far too late in the DVD. However, one of the reasons I like Leslie's exercise routines is because of the very fact that she can be a bit goofy. I'd much rather do an exercise DVD hosted by someone who is a little unpolished, it gives me hope since I can be a little uncoordinated.I really enjoy exercising with "Walk and Jog".

Leslie Sansone's "Walk and Kick" is her version of a kickboxing workout. Featuring Leslie and a group of others, it is a 30 minute workout. Along with her regular four basic steps (walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts), Leslie features four intervals with various kickboxing aspects."Walk and Kick" is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone exercise DVD's. I do it when I feel the need for an intense workout - I am sweating by the time I'm done. The DVD is a nice idea as Leslie's workouts already involve kicks - adding punches is an inspired way to up her workouts. She does her usual routine, including kickbacks, in-between the kickboxing intervals. The intervals are intense but fun. The first interval is a combination of mini squats, bobbing and weaving, and cross punches and uppercuts. The second interval is more focused on kicking - front kicks and back kicks. The third interval has you placing your hip towards the TV, shifting your weight back and forth while moving your hands like you were punching a feed bag. The last interval combines knee lifts and punches (four at a time, then two at a time, and then single knee lifts and punches). These four intervals are intense but exhilarating."Walk and Kick" is a nice intense exercise DVD.

The Kindle 2 is a versatile, easy to use wireless reading device. You can use it to not only download books, but magazines, newspapers, and blogs. You can also download audio books or use the Kindle 2's Text-to-Speech feature to listen to books (where allowed by the rights holder). You can download over a thousand books, newspapers, blogs and magazines on to the Kindle 2. The Kindle 2 includes the New Oxford American Dictionary so if you don't know what a word means you can immediately look it up. You can take notes on the Kindle 2 while reading; highlight passages; "clip" entire passages and save them; and bookmark pages you want to return to later. You can also use the Kindle 2 to access the internet - mostly websites that are text based. You can adjust the size of the text you are reading (there are six sizes to choose from) and you can enlarge pictures or images in the reading material. If you think you might want to buy a book but aren't sure, you can download free samples to see if you like it before buying it.What I like about the Kindle 2: a lot of things, starting with how easy and intuitive it is to use and how easy it is to read the text. It is about the size of a paperback novel, light and easy to hold. The Whispernet technology allows you to download books even if you are not near a computer. The dictionary is an excellent feature and you can download other dictionaries if you don't want to use the one included. The text-to-speech option is another nice feature (if somewhat limited because of copyright concerns). You can choose between a male or female voice and can adjust the speed rate: slow, default, faster. The voice is a bit tinny and the pronunciation can be a bit off but it is still a great feature. All of the books you buy for the Kindle 2 from Amazon are automatically backed up on Amazon so if you delete a book from the Kindle 2 you can always restore it at a later time. The Kindle 2 comes with a universal power adapter that will work worldwide which is great for people who travel. The battery status indicator is very easy to read as is the indicator showing how much storage space is left. Books for the Kindle 2 are generally cheaper than the hard copy price and there are a number of free or books under $1.00 available for the Kindle 2.What I don't like: There is a lot to like about the Kindle 2, but there are a few things I don't like. While the Kindle 2 has a bar indicating how far along you are in a book (15%, 55%, etc.) and a bar showing your location within the Kindle 2, I really wish it listed the page number you are on in the book. While you can download audio books onto your computer and then onto the Kindle 2, the Kindle 2 only supports books from audible.com. Also, there is a pause/play button for the audio books but no stop control. The Kindle 2 makes it easy to navigate back and forth between pages, but while there is a "next page" button on both sides of the Kindle 2, the "previous page" button is only on one side which is a bit confusing. The five way controller is a nice way to move around the Kindle 2 but it is sometimes difficult to use. The Kindle 2 automatically deletes issues of periodicals that are more than seven issues old - you can override this feature but you need to be diligent or you may lose unread periodicals. While you can buy items directly from the Kindle 2, I find it much easier to buy them from Amazon where it is easier to sort through items.Bottom-line: The Kindle 2 is a very versatile, very easy to use wireless reading device. I wasn't sure how often I would use it, but I use it on a daily basis and wonder how I ever got along without it.

Date with Destiny is the first book in Harlequin's Forrester Square Series. I usually find books containing stories written by several authors a mixed bag, but this was pretty good.This book is about the Perez brothers, Rick, Rafe and Rob. Its somewhat loose theme is about a tuxedo left at their door addressed to R. Perez. Each brother will get a chance to wear the tuxedo in his story.Transforming Frankie by Kristine RolofsonThis is the story of Frankie Raimondi and Rick Perez. Frankie works with her father doing construction work. Her sister is getting married and Frankie hires a date for the wedding. Rick Perez is an actor looking for work and this is one of his gigs. Frankie and Rick went to high school together and meeting again brings back old feelings. But Frankie is insecure, she feels more comfortable wearing a hard hat and boots then dressing up, and Rick has to break through those feelings.This was an enjoyable read. I liked reading about Frankie's family, in fact, I wish this had been a full length book.Protecting Maria by Muriel JensenIn this story, Maria Castillo and Rafe Perez, were lovers three years ago, but she left him and married another man because she thought Rafe couldn't commit. Now a widow and eight months pregnant, she meets Rafe again when he hires a limo to take him home from a party. Their feelings for each other are quickly rekindled, but they must first find out who is trying to frame her for murder.This was my least favorite of the three stories. There were too many coincidences in the plot. Rafe had too much to drink at a party, so he hires a limo that just happens to be driven by his ex-lover. And the host of the party gives him Salmon as a gift that he wants to put in the trunk and that's how they find the dead body. And there were a limited number of people who could have committed the murder, so there was no real suspense over that.Distracting Diana by Kristin GabrielRob Perez is a single father raising two children after his wife dies in childbirth. He meets Diana Falco while she is collecting money for charity at Christmas time. Sparks fly immediately, but because of an incident in her past where a child was hurt, Diana is certain she will not be a good mother. It's up to Rob to convince her!This was a nice read. Rob's children are adorable and the Christmas setting makes it all the more fun.Date with Destiny introduces some of the characters that will show up in the later books Forrester Square Series and is a nice start to a generally good series.

Seth Webster has been struggling since his wife died. His six year old twin boys are out of control, his house is in chaos, and while he's hired housekeepers none of them last long. When Mrs. Merkle shows up at his house she seems to be a miracle - in fact his kids call her Mrs. Miracle. Mrs. Miracle soon gets Seth's house in order, but she has more tricks up her sleeve - she helps orchestrate a romance between Seth and travel agent Reba Maxwell. Reba has some baggage of her own - she has never forgiven her sister for something that happened years ago. As Mrs. Miracle works her magic on Seth and Reba, she is also trying to help Seth's in-laws, Sharon and Jerry, whose long-standing marriage has hit a very rocky patch. And as if that wasn't enough, there is the matter of sharp-tongued Harriett Foster who needs a gentle nudge to set her on the right path. To pull all of this off at Christmas time will truly take a miracle."Mrs. Miracle" is a very cute romance novel by Debbie Macomber that is sure to warm readers' hearts. A Christmas setting in this type of book is always a nice one and Macomber makes good use of it. The novel is a nice mixture of romance and humor with a little magic thrown in. Even without the magic elements the story is a good one. Readers will sympathize with Seth who is still dealing with the loss of his wife and truly has no control over his children. The children, Judd and Jason, while rambunctious, are never bratty. Reba's character is well developed - she is so wrapped up in bitterness over her sister's betrayal that she fails to see how her behavior is not only hurting her family, but herself. The romance between Seth and Reba is very sweet, just a bit spicy by Macomber's standards (no sex though). While the plot line with Harriett Foster could have been developed more, the bittersweet plot line with Sharon and Jerry is extremely well done and you'll pull for the two of them to work things out after almost forty years of marriage. The magical elements are very cute and it is best if readers don't think too much about where Mrs. Miracle came from."Mrs. Miracle" is a very cute holiday romance.

Robert and Lily Brewster are siblings trying to make ends meet during the Depression. They have inherited their great uncle's mansion, but still must take in boarders and do odd jobs to earn money. In this installment in the "Grace and Favor" series, they take temporary jobs in a nursing home. Before long they are involved in another mystery when one of the patients is smothered in his bed. There are plenty of suspects, including the patient's wife and family, many of whom haven't seen or talked to him in years. But then another body turns up and the Brewsters, along with Chief of Police Howard Walker, work to find out if the two cases are related and catch the murderer."It Had to Be You" is an amusing, if light mystery. The historical details, Franklin Roosevelt has just been elected President, are the most interesting parts of the book. Lily and Robert and strong characters, maturing with each book in the series. While there have been hints in the descriptions of the various books that Lily is attracted to Howard Walker, it doesn't come across that way in the book, there's no sense of any attraction between the two of them. I hope that's developed in future books.The mystery itself is pretty light. Jill Churchill throws in plenty of suspects, but it's pretty obvious from the beginning who the murderer is. I read the book hoping that Churchill would throw in a plot twist and have someone else commit the murder, but I was disappointed. And she never explains why the murder took place when the victim was very ill and hours away from dying.This is a good but unchallenging mystery.

Outside of a brief role as a police detective on a TV show, aspiring actress Nikki Sands has had little success and is working as a waitress. Unfortunately, she loses that job when she accidentally spills wine on an obnoxious customer. Luckily the customer's date was vineyard owner Derek Malveaux who immediately offers Nikki a job at his vineyard. Nikki is hesitant at first, but needs a job so she agrees to check out the place. Nikki has barely unpacked when she discovers a murder victim near her cottage. Rather than leave, Nikki decides to investigate the murder using the skills she picked up during her TV show. Even a second murder and Derek's dysfunctional family can't stop Nikki once she gets started."Murder Uncorked" is Michele Scott's first book in the new Wine Lover's Mystery Series and it has some good points and some bad points. The mystery is well plotted with some neat twists throughout the book that will keep the reader guessing. Nikki is at times a likable and sympathetic character, especially when the author gives readers a look into Nikki's troubled childhood. Yet Nikki has her faults, including the fact that she is far too eager to jump in and solve the mystery when most people would run, if not after the first murder, surely after the second one. Her efforts at crime solving are clumsy at times - she often gives her real name when questioning suspects. Derek Malveaux is movie star handsome (as is everyone in the book) and dedicated to his vineyard. He is attracted to Nikki, but understandably wary, especially since she keeps stumbling over dead bodies.The writing is awkward at times. The viewpoint is mostly from Nikki's perspective, but it occasionally switches to Derek's viewpoint without warning. Many of the other characters in the book come across not as real characters, but as stereotypical rich snobs and much of their dialogue sounded false. Nikki's discovery of the second victim was awkward, especially when she says she is going to use her cell phone to make a call and in the next paragraph goes into a bedroom to find a phone to use, conveniently stumbling over another dead body. There's also a scene where the police question Nikki's alibi in a room full of people that rang false - wouldn't the police question her privately? Nikki's Aunt Cara, who helped raise her) is a cop (and I hope she shows up in future books), yet Nikki seems to have little respect for cops in general. Finally, as sympathetic a character as Nikki can be, it's hard to totally like someone who seems far too nosy; she hasn't even started working at the vineyard and yet is willing to break into people's offices to help solve the mystery.Despite the flaws, readers should take into consideration that this is the first book in a new mystery series and first books are often awkward as characters and situations are maneuvered into place for future books. Many mystery series don't hit their stride until the second or third book in the series. I'm hoping this is the case in the Wine Lover's Series since Michele Scott has a way with plotting mysteries that will have me reading the second book.

Maggie O'Neill is unhappy with her job and when she practically falls into an offer to work at an antique store called Enchantments she eagerly agrees. She quickly becomes friends with storeowner Felicity Dow and is intrigued when she finds out that Felicity calls herself a witch. Maggie is just starting to learn the ropes at Enchantments when Felicity's estranged sister Isabella is murdered and the police consider Felicity to be their number one suspect. Maggie doesn't believe Felicity is the killer and sets out to convince the police. But by doing so, she not only risks the wrath of hunky Deputy Tom Fielding, but she's putting herself in danger from a crazed killer."The Trouble with Magic" is the very good first book in what looks like a charming series. I love the antique store setting and the magic elements in the book. Author Madelyn Alt does a good job of depicting life in a small town and the many secrets people living there have. Maggie is a good heroine - bored with her job and her life and looking for a change. She's a loyal friend, although I have to admit I wondered why she was so willing to help Felicity when she barely knew her. Felicity too is a great character - although perhaps a little too trusting. Of the other characters Tom Fielding and the mysterious Marcus Quinn stand out. It will be interesting to see how Maggie's relationship with the two of them develops in future books. The magical elements are well done and quite believable. The mystery itself is well plotted, with plenty of suspects, although readers may figure out who the killer is a bit earlier than they would like.A Charmed Death (Bewitching Mystery, Book 2)is the second book in this bewitching series. Enjoy.

Residents of the small town of Sitting Marsh in England are looking for a distraction from the worries of World War II and find it during the wedding of Priscilla Pierce and Captain Willy Carbunkle. The residents band together, even donating their own rations, to give Priscilla and Wally a perfect wedding. Unfortunately, the wedding celebration is marred by the stabbing death of a stranger who wasn't even invited to the wedding. When it turns out that the victim was the boyfriend of one of the bridesmaids and they had been seen arguing earlier, suspicion falls on her and her family. But Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton has solved a few mysteries in the past and isn't convinced the police have the right suspects and decides to investigate the murder herself.This is yet another delightful entry in Kate Kingsbury's Manor House mystery series. The mystery was intriguing and well plotted and Kingsbury threw in a nifty red herring that had me convinced early on that I knew who the murdered was, but I was totally wrong. The historical background is interesting, especially the details of rationing and blackouts. The real strength in these books are the characters: Lady Elizabeth struggling with her duties as Lady of the Manor and her love for Major Earl Monroe (who is regrettably in the background for much of this book); her faithful servants Violet and Martin; the various village ladies; and, of course, Sadie and Polly, young girls looking for love in war torn England.Unfortunately, this is the second to last book in the Manor House series. The series will be missed, but this gives Kingsbury a chance to tie together the many themes that have gone on through all the books, including the identity of the "three musketeers" and a resolution of Elizabeth's relationship with Earl.

"The Teammates" begins and ends with a trip taken in October 2001 by former Red Sox players Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky (along with local television personality Dick Flavin) to visit a dying Ted Williams. The three, along with Bobby Doerr who could not make the trip, were not only teammates but also friends for years. "The Teammates" is the story of the friendship between four entirely different men."The Teammates" is a wonderful and thoroughly engrossing book about baseball and friendship. Baseball was different back then and with the exception of Pesky, the only team the four played for was the Red Sox which helped cement their friendship. David Halberstam does a terrific job of catching the personality of each player. While it would have been easy to focus just on Ted Williams, he focuses equally on each player and readers get to know all four as individuals by the end of the book. Johnny "needle nose" Pesky, who still works for the Red Sox, became a Red Sox player because his family liked the Red Sox representative; old-fashioned and all American boy Bobby Doerr, was the closest to Williams; Dom DiMaggio, playing in the shadow of his brothers, struggled to make it to the big leagues; and of course Ted Williams, immensely talented and as hard on himself as he was on the people in his life. "The Teammates" is filled with anecdotes about the players including two memorable encounters between Williams and Pedro Ramos, a young pitcher for Washington and a fishing trip that Williams and Doerr took in the early 1960's that tested Doerr's patience and friendship. Williams was a complex, not always likable, person and Halberstam does a remarkable job of creating an even-handed profile of him. Some of the interesting information in the book includes how Tom Yawkey almost blew the deal that landed Ted Williams; how much pitching has changed these days (back then teams had more than one pitcher who won 20 - 25 games a year); and how Williams was called to serve in both World War II and Korea and how the dynamics of the Red Sox had changed by the time Williams got back from Korea. Halbertstam also touches on the Red Sox "curse" notably in the 1946 World Series in which DiMaggio got hurt and Pesky was considered the goat for years, which he quietly accepted. The book ends, as it began, with the surviving teammates as they are today."The Teammates" is a well done book about friendship.

"Older Adults Walk and Firm" is a combination of walking and exercising with weights. The walking comes first and has the usual Leslie Sansone walking moves - walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks. The video is approximately 30 minutes long, has about 8 minutes of warm-ups, 15 minutes of exercising with the weights and about 7 minutes of cool down. All of this is nice and gentle and nothing is too hard to do.I really enjoy exercising to "Older Adults Walk and Firm". The video is just Leslie, no one else walking and exercising with her. It is a bit slower paced than some of Leslie's other exercise videos, but that's fine because it works perfectly for older adults especially those that have never exercised before. Leslie talks you through the exercises and anything new - like squats and lunges - she introduces slowly. The warm-ups are just the right length. The weight section is very nicely paced. It combines the usual walking exercises (walking in place, walking up and down, side steps, knee lifts and kicks) with exercises such as squats, bicep curls, lifting the weights over your head, and lunges. Leslie guides you through all these exercises and they are done nice and slowly but are still effective. While none of the exercises felt too strenuous while I was doing them, at the end I felt like I got a good workout.A word of warning - make sure you watch the introduction before you start exercising. In the introduction, Leslie explains how the program works and what kind of weights to use - gloved weights or dumbbells weighing up to two pounds. Also, I love Leslie's exercise programs, but she has a tendency to talk too much and sometimes interrupts the flow of exercising while talking and she gestures a lot which can be confusing.All in all, I really enjoy "Older Adults Walk and Firm".

Nurse Beth Partridge first meets Professor Alexander van Zeust when she literally runs into him while riding her bicycle. After that, it seems like she keeps bumping into him since he is doing some surgery and consulting at the hospital she works at. Beth enjoys their encounters and she has feelings for him that she can't explain. When Alexander offers Beth the chance to go nurse his sister, Martina, who just had her appendix removed and take care of Martina's four young children, Beth jumps at the chance. She's been feeling a bit restless in her job and is tired of living in a cramped apartment with her brother William. She grew up in the country and misses it. Beth realizes that she may see Alex while taking care of Martina and her children and looks forward to their encounters, although she's not sure why. As for Alex, he's old enough to know what he wants and patient enough to wait for Beth to realize what her true feelings are."A Star Looks Down" is another delightful romance from Betty Neels. She used one of her basic plot lines - rich, handsome Dutch doctor falls in love with plain, but feisty, English nurse - and did what she did best with that plot line, create an enjoyable, sweet romance. Beth is a nice heroine - a bit put upon by older step brother Philip who basically took her beloved house in the country away from her and by younger brother William who has a habit of borrowing money from her - but very loving and caring. She's so used to being told that she is plain that she doesn't realize how wonderful her hair and eyes are, which makes her an endearing heroine. Professor Alexander Van Zeust is the kind of hero that only exists in Betty Neels novels - a very talented doctor, very rich, owner of several large and beautifully furnished homes in several countries, in love with Beth and willing to take his time until she realizes she is in love with him. The supporting characters are well written. William is a bit selfish, but harmless unlike Phillip who is a true villain; Alexander's sister Martina is a bit spoiled, but a loving mother; and the children are all sweet and adorable, with Dirk, the oldest, the real standout, as he seems to be a real child, with real feelings and faults. The romance between Beth and Alexander is nicely done, but very old-fashioned. Romance readers who want more than chaste kisses between the hero and heroine, won't find it in a Betty Neels book."A Star Looks Down" is another winner from Betty Neels.

In the fifth book in Jennie Nimmo's Children of the Red King series, odd things are happening in Charlie Bone's neighborhood. First there is an odd snowstorm and then all the animals disappear. Benjamin Brown, recently returned from Hong Kong, misses his dog Runner Bean and wants Charlie to help get the dog back. Charlie agrees, although he's upset that Benjamin's parents are working at Bloor Academy as spies. Charlie also has other problems. His grandmother Maisie has been frozen and he and his Uncle Paton are unable to break the spell. The Flames also warn Charlie that his mother is in danger, but it's impossible for him to watch over her while he's at school. Sure enough, Amy Bone meets the mysterious Hart Noble and begins to change. Charlie begins looking harder than ever for his missing father before his mother forgets him entirely. Charlie is going to need the help of all his friends, including new friend Naren Bloor, to make things right again."Charlie Bone and the Hidden King" was an okay book in an okay series. There are some nice fantasy elements such as Charlie's wand still helping him even though it's a moth and Naren's ability to do "shadow writing". The disappearance and reappearance of the animals is well done. Also interesting is how Charlie's power is growing and Manfred's development of a new power. Unfortunately, Nimmo doesn't use her own imagination enough and many elements in the book come across as Harry Potter rip-offs: there are other schools with endowed children (a dinner scene with head teachers from those schools is straight out of "The Goblet of Fire"); a map; the fact that Charlie has a wand; and there is a magic mirror. The book is awkwardly written and shifts from different the viewpoints of different characters instead of just Charlie's viewpoint. Nimmo often explains things in writing instead of showing readers through the actions of the characters. Many of the characters aren't well developed and when a teacher's secret is revealed it doesn't make the impact that it should since the teacher doesn't register as a character before that. The plot line of Benjamin's parents being spies comes to an abrupt and not very plausible end. While there is a major and quite well done twist at the end involving one of the children, the whole ending of the book feels rushed. Since this was supposed to be the last book in the series (there's another on the way), Nimmo wraps up most of the plot lines, but the plot line involving his father should have been much more developed and I found the end to that particular plot line rather flat.Children will like "Charlie Bone and the Hidden King" and the entire Children of the Red King Series, but adults will want deeper reading.

Rosalee, a grocery clerk in West Virginia, enters an Internet contest and wins a date with handsome movie star, Tad Hamilton. Tad falls hard for Rosalee and shows up in West Virginia in pursuit of her. This doesn't sit well with her friend, Pete, who's been secretly in love with Rosalee for years. When Tad wins a part in a new movie and wants Rosalee to be with him during filming, Pete needs to reveal his feelings or lose her forever.This is a good, but at times weak, movie. The romance is the weak part, there's no real chemistry between Rosalee and Tad on their date, so it's hard to believe he'd follow her to West Virginia. And it's also hard to believe that Pete hasn't acted on his feelings for Rosalee in all the years he's known her. The comedy parts of the movie work much better, with some of the funniest scenes taking place at a farm Tad buys.The actors are really what make this film work. Kate Bosworth, Topher Grace, and Josh Duhamel shine in the lead roles, especially Duhamel, who has the perfect good looks to play a movie star, which he does to perfection. The supporting actors are equally good, including Ginnifer Goodwin, Gary Cole, Nathan Lane, and Sean Hayes (in two roles). Kathryn Hahn is especially good as the bartender with a not so secret crush on Pete.This is a good movie to watch when you're in the mood for a nice, sweet, light, romantic comedy.

"Intriguing Lateral Thinking Puzzles" contains 110 puzzles that have strange situations that need a rational explanation. The puzzles don't include everything needed to solve them, but there is a clue section to help. The book is designed for two or more people, with one person asking the puzzles and answering questions with either "yes, no, or irrelevant" while others try to solve the puzzles. There are five puzzle sections: Dangerous and Deadly Puzzles; Easy and Elementary Puzzles; Intriguing and Interesting Puzzles; Challenging and Chastening Puzzles; and Fascinating and Fiendish Puzzles. The clue section, which immediately follows the puzzle section, is arranged by puzzle name, however, the answer section is arranged alphabetically. There is one WALLY test, which is fourteen fairly easy riddles."Intriguing Lateral Thinking Puzzles" is one of the best lateral thinking puzzle books that I've read. It's not perfect, while they are meant to be solved using clues, some of the puzzles are too short (some are only one sentence long!) and there's just not enough information to solve them. Examples of this are: "The Hasty Packer", "Poor Dogs", "Untying the Rope", "The Cloth", and "Nun-plussed". Several of the puzzles are implausible, which makes it frustrating to try to solve them. These puzzles include: "New Shoes", "40 Feet Ahead", "Strange Reactions", "Desert", "Mutilation", "The Parcel", "The Missing Diamond", "Three Notes" and "Catching a Bullet". However, for the most part the book is a nice mix of puzzles ranging from easy to puzzles that require real lateral thinking. Some of the easier puzzles include the WALLY test as well as "School Friend", "The Clinch", "Precognition", "Red Light", "Call Box", "Library Lunacy", "The Crash", "Doctor's Appointment", and "Poor Impersonation". Some of the best puzzles in the book, the ones requiring real lateral thinking, include: "The Sign", "Heartless", "Thirsty", "The Tree and the Axe", "Confectionery Manufacturer", "The Painter", "Beautiful Girls", "Orange Trick", "Good-bye, Mother", "Car in the River", "The Typist", "Two Jugs", "Twin Trouble", "Invaluable", "The Code" and "Time of Arrival". "Fair Deal" is a classic lateral-thinking puzzle that still caught me off guard. The clue section is a mixed bag - the most helpful clues were for the puzzles "The Deadly Melody", "Dead Drunk", and "The Hasty Packer". Having the answers in alphabetical order is a great idea because it prevents you from accidentally seeing the answer to the next puzzle."Intriguing Lateral Thinking Puzzles" is extremely clever and well done.

On a beautiful October day in Boston, Clay Riddell, an artist from Maine, is on top of the world because he has just sold a graphic novel to a publisher. Little does he realize that the world as he knows it is about to change. A "pulse" has been sent through cell phones that turns anyone using their cell phone into zombies. Clay doesn't have a cell phone and he watches in disbelief as people around him attack each other and even themselves. Clay soon hooks up with Tom McCourt and fifteen year old Alice Maxwell, who were both unaffected by the Pulse. Clay is anxious to find his wife and son, so the three head out to Maine to find them. They have a long, strange journey ahead of them.After several non-horror novels, Stephen King returns to horror with "Cell" and what a return it is. The "Pulse" hits just a few pages into the book and it's non-stop action from that point forward. "Cell" is told entirely from Clay's point of view and readers are privy to his thoughts only, so his is the best defined character, although I could picture Tom very well also. King's strong point is his story telling, reading his books you can picture what his happening, as if you were watching a movie instead of reading a book. It's the little touches that make his writing special - a street littered with discarded cell phones; an abandoned child's sneaker; a pregnant zombie falling on her stomach; a hamburger feast in the middle of chaos - all these stay with the reader long after the novel is over.This being a Stephen King novel, readers can't predict what will happen and just when you think you know where the novel is going, "Cell" has some unexpected twists, starting with the visit to Gaiten Academy. The novel has plenty of gore mixed in with King's trademark humor. And while many readers will complain about the (non-) ending, I liked it."Cell" may not be his best novel, but it's one of his better ones and a must read for Stephen King fans.

I had a lot of problems getting the cap on the tank correctly. I would fill it up in the sink and test it to make sure it didn't leak. Many times it was fine, but on more than one occasion, I would place the tank on the base only to have the water drain out of the tank, even though the cap was on firmly. One night it seemed to be working fine, but I woke up the next morning to find the tank not only completely drained, but warped out of shape! The stand I had placed the humidifier on was also damaged, apparently by the steam. I'm lucky it didn't cause a fire. I will not buy this humidifier again.

Marlene Crowley hires Boston PI Spenser to find out if her husband is cheating on her. What seems like a simple case quickly becomes complicated when Marlene's husband, Trent, is murdered. Trent was a CFO at Kinergy, an energy trading company. Investigating the murder, Spenser discovers several wrong-doings at Kinergy, including spouse swapping, shoddy accounting practices and another murder. Spenser has plenty of suspects and works with the usual crew, including his long-time love, Susan Silverman, and his friend, Hawk, to solve the crime.Robert Parker's Spenser series is what I call cotton candy for the brain. There's nothing groundbreaking here, it's just a highly entertaining read and there's nothing wrong with that. What makes the series work is the snappy humorous dialogue between the characters. My only complaint is that there's not enough Hawk, he doesn't show up until halfway through the book. The mystery itself is fine, if transparent, but I don't read Parker's books for the plot but for the interactions between characters, especially Spenser and Hawk.This is a good beach book.

Told in diary form by Amy and spread out over the course of a year, "Diary of A Mad Bride" is an occasionally amusing novel about the events leading up to the marriage of Amy Thomas and Stephen Stewart. As the book opens, Amy's friend Mandy is in a dither about getting married and Amy swears that she'll never get married. Of course, she quickly changes her mind when Stephen proposes but she then swears that she won't be as uptight about her wedding as Mandy was. Naturally that too changes, as Amy encounters all kinds of calamities leading up and including her wedding day.This is a light and at times funny novel. Anyone who's been married, is about to be married, or been a bridesmaid will recognize some of the problems Amy goes through while planning her wedding. Amy's mood swings are particularly funny and there's a lot of reality in her attempts to juggle planning the wedding and working full time. But she too often seems almost disconnected from her own wedding. Although she makes incredibly long lists of things to do for the wedding, she never makes much progress on them. Far too many scenes seem to be written just for the humor - it can't be that difficult to find the perfect wedding gown in all of New York City and I find it hard to believe that Amy would agree to wear her mother's wedding gown sight unseen. And, I realize the book was written this way for the humor, but the wedding felt rushed, especially due to the lack of money Amy and Stephen had. Other scenes that potentially could be mined for humor like trying to figure out place settings, a headache for any bride are left untouched. And what bride would not be involved in picking out the Maid of Honor and Bridesmaid dresses? Or just go to the hairdresser the day of the wedding and let the hairdresser do what they want?In the end, "Diary of A Mad Bride" seems to have been written in much the same rush as Amy and Stephen's wedding was planned. It's an okay read, but with a little more preparation it could have been great reading.

Fifteen year old Mia Thermopolis is awkward, with glasses, frizzy hair that she can't control, and just wants to blend into the scenery. She is good at being "invisible" and cannot make a speech in front of her class without becoming sick to her stomach. Imagine her surprise when her grandmother, her father's mother whom she's never met, arrives in town and tells Mia that she is really a princess! Mia is hesitant about being put in the spotlight, but she starts taking "Princess lessons". Not only does she learn how to be a Princess, but she learns how to be true to herself and who her true friends really are.This is a good clean, fun movie for women of all ages. Most teenage girls with identify with Mia as well as any woman who can remember what it was like to be a teenager (and who can't?). The movie doesn't break any new ground, movies like this never do, but who cares? It's great to see Julie Andrews in a starring role and she has a lot of fun with the part. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Anne Hathaway (although she is far too pretty for the audience to believe she is ever an ugly duckling), Hector Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, and Robert Schwartzman.

International Figure Skating has articles on past, present, and future skaters from all countries, but mainly the U.S., Canada, Russia, the U.K. and Asia. It was recently taken over by a new publisher who has made a few changes, mainly changing the focus from short paragraphs about skaters to longer, detailed articles. Other changes include a listing of web pages featuring skaters, articles aimed at skating students, and movies, television and books about skating. Remaining as features are results from competitions and a long article each issue on a featured skaters. The pictures are well done.International Figure Skating is a good read for figure skating fans.

Unsure of what to do with her life after dropping out of law school, Abby Knight opened up a flower shop. She loves her work, but business is slow and money is tight, so she's not thrilled when she sees someone hit her vintage Corvette and then takes off. When a murdered body is discovered not far away, Abby thinks the person that hit her car was the murderer. She's working with a hunky ex-cop to solve the murder, as well as helping a friend escape her abusive husband and soon someone is trying to kill Abby too.I have mixed feelings about "Mum's the Word". Abby, the heroine, was annoying, meddling to the point where readers could understand why someone would try to kill her. And she comes across as stupid at times, mistaking drugs for fertilizer, as a flower shop owner she should know what fertilizer looks like. No wonder she has very few customers! Marco, the leather wearing, hunk of an ex-cop is a clich&eacute;. The secondary characters, like Nikki, Abby's roommate, and Lotti and Grace, her co-workers, are far more interesting. Abby's father, an ex-cop crippled after being shot while on duty, was an interesting character and I'd like to read more about him. Finally, the flower shop set up is fun to read about.This was an okay book, with enough promise that I've already bought the next book in the series, hoping it will be a better read.

When Reverend Schrock dies while judging a chili bakeoff, his widow, convinced that someone murdered her husband by putting peanut butter into the chili (he was allergic) asks Magdalena Yoder to investigate. Magdalena has been helping her brother-in-law, police chief Melvin Stoltzfus, solve cases for years and is happy to oblige. When Melvin tells her he is quitting her job, Mags find herself working alone. As she works to solve the case, Magdalena uncovers many secrets about Reverend Schrock that shock her. Little does she realize that more surprises will come her way, including a long buried family secret. But the biggest shock of all will come when she realizes who murdered Reverend Schrock."Assault and Pepper" is an entertaining mystery. Magdalena, a somewhat naive Mennonite with a taste for hot chocolate, is a hoot, especially as she discovers that Reverend Schrock was not quite was he seemed (not only was he a bigamist and an embezzler, but (gasp!) he was a bowler!) As always, the supporting characters are larger than life, especially Melvin, but are still fun to read about. Magdalena can be a bit acerbic, but the affection between her and her cook, Freni, and even her sister Susannah keep her lovable. Author Tamar Myers even pokes fun at herself, as astute readers who have visited her website will notice.Unfortunately, while this book is better plotted than some of the other books in the series, which sometimes rely too heavily on humor, the plot still has some flaws. The motive for a second murder is never explained and Magdalena looks for what is supposedly a key piece of evidence, but why it is so important is not explained either.Still, flaws aside, Assault and Pepper is a good read, with a surprising ending (in more ways than one) which may take the series in an entirely different direction.

Meg Lanslow's relationship with her boyfriend Michael is going strong, but they are having a hard time finding some private time together. Meg thinks she knows the perfect place for a romantic getaway - her Aunt Phoebe's cottage in Monhegan, Maine. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned, the boat trip is rough because a hurricane is headed their way and once they reach the island, Meg and Michael realize it's been invaded by avid bird watchers. Even worse, once they get to the cottage they find that Meg's Aunt Phoebe, brother, and parents are already there! Due to the impending hurricane, Meg and Michael are stuck there and try to make the best they can out of the situation. But when a famous painter is found murdered on the island and Aunt Phoebe confesses to the murder and her father is a suspect, Meg is knee deep in murder once again."Murder With Puffins" is a nice cozy mystery. There's a nice sense of humor throughout the book, including the title of each chapter: "The Agony and the Puffin", "East of Puffin", and "A Cat Among the Puffins" are some examples. The book is full of eccentric characters, including everyone in Meg's family. Meg is a spunky heroine but Mike is a bit bland in this book. The mystery itself is well plotted with plenty of suspects and plenty of motives, although the way the murder itself is committed is a bit unbelievable. I liked the fact that, unlike in most cozy mysteries, Meg doesn't want to confront the murderer herself but wants to go for the police instead.Nicely done.

After her husband kills himself, Penelope Thornton-McClure, moved to Rhode Island with her seven year old son, Spencer, and buys into her aunt's bookstore. She arranges an appearance in the store by Timothy Brennan, author of a series of books based on the real-life unsolved murder of private eye Jack Shepard in that very location. Brennan, who turns out to be a jerk, chokes and dies during his talk at the store. There are plenty of suspects, including Penelope herself, who handed Brennan the tainted water bottle that ended up killing him. Penelope plays detective to clear her name, with unexpected help from the ghost of Jack Shepard.This was a fun book to read. Having a ghost as one of the detectives is a clever idea and works well. Author Alice Kimberly does a great job of switching from Penelope's viewpoint (first person) to Jack's (third person). Also done well is Jack's dialogue. Since he died 50 years ago, he still sounds like a hard boiled detective from the 1950's and he is amazed at the current technology, such as computers, that Penelope uses to help solve the murder.Alice Kimberly knows and cares a lot about books and bookstores and it shows. The mystery itself was good, although I guessed a major plot twist fairly early. Still, this was an excellent first book in what promises to be an interesting series.

Like her namesake, Jaine Austen is a writer, but a freelance writer, meaning she'll take just about any job that will help pay the bills. So when geeky nerd Howard Murdoch shows up at her door asking her to write a love letter for him she agrees although she doubts gorgeous aerobics instructor Stacy Lawrence will agree to go out with him. Much to Jaine's surprise, Stacy agrees to go out with Howard on Valentine's Day! Alas, Howard's triumph is short lived when he shows up for the date and finds Stacy's murdered body. Detective Timothy Rea is convinced Howard is the killer, but Jaine's not so sure and sets out to clear his name. She has plenty of suspects, including Stacy's neighbors, coworkers, and ex-boyfriend. She needs to find who the killer is before she becomes the next victim."This Pen for Hire" is an extremely funny cozy mystery. The humor starts with the name of the heroine, Jaine Austen (her mother was a bad speller), and continues from there with the fact that the modern Jane is a writer but no, well no Jane Austen. Some of the funniest bits in the book are the writing she does for various companies. Jaine is a good heroine - struggling not only to find writing jobs to pay her bills but struggling with her weight and a bit insecure because of that. Her friend Kandi, a writer on the cartoon show Beanie and the Cockroach, adds to the humor in the novel as she is always looking for "Mr. Right". Of the rest of the characters, I'd like to see more of Jaine's nosy neighbor Lance.Because the book is on the slim side and heavy on the humor, I was afraid the mystery elements would be underdeveloped, but I was pleasantly surprised. The murder was well plotted, with a good motive, plenty of suspects and some nice red herrings along the way. The writing is nicely done as if Jaine were talking directly to the reader and very enjoyable."This Pen for Hire" is a laugh out loud funny cozy mystery. The next book in the series isLast Writes (Jaine Austen Mysteries). Enjoy!

The CobraCo Plant Sitter fits almost any size planter or hanging basket and slowly waters and fertilizes your plants. It comes with a water tank holds to siphon the water and a ceramic sensor. Depending on your plants needs, the CobraCo Plant Sitter will water your plants for 2 to 3 weeks before needing refilling.The CobraCo Plant Sitter is very easy to set up. I soaked the ceramic watering head in water for 15 minutes before using it. After that I am uncapped it and filled it with water, tightly recapping it afterward. I hung the tank on my plant (a spider plant) and filled the tank with water. I inserted the ceramic sensor into the soil, pointing it at the roots, and put the feeding tube into the water tank letting it hit the bottom of the tank.While I was looking forward to using the CobraCo Plant Sitter - my spider plants have had better days and I'm afraid I'm overwatering them - I'm not quite happy with it. For starters the plastic tank is quite flimsy and I had a hard time getting the cover to close. And I'm not quite sure the CobraCo Plant Sitter is working. I filled the tank three weeks ago yet the water level seems to have barely moved. I've tried several things including putting the ceramic sensor down more into the soil and straightening out the feeding tube several times (it has as many kinks in it and I'm not sure the water is getting through it). The odd part is that even though the water level doesn't seem to be moving, the soil in the plant does seem to be moist. I'm guessing the spider plant is getting water, I just can't see the difference (the edge of the leaves are still turning brown - an issue before I got the CobraCo Plant Sitter).In the end, as much as I want to, I really can't recommend the CobraCo Plant Sitter.

Life has been a struggle for single mother Denise Holton. Her four-year-old son, Kyle, has problems with his speech and she barely makes enough money working in a diner to support the two of them. Denise is petrified when Kyle runs away after she gets into a car accident while swerving to avoid a deer, but he is found because of the persistence of volunteer firefighter Taylor McAden. Taylor befriends the Holtons and soon he and Denise are romantically involved. But Taylor, while always willing to risk his life as a fireman, isn't as willing to risk his heart. Taylor was a young boy when his father died tragically at the age of 36 and Taylor blames himself for the death and has never recovered from his loss. He has a habit of rescuing woman and then when he has gotten close to them, he has pulled away, convinced he doesn't need anyone in his life. This time it looks like things might be different as he grows increasingly closer to Denise and bonds with Kyle, playing catch with him, letting him "drive" his truck, and winning prizes for him at a carnival. But when Taylor realizes how close he has become to both Denise and Kyle, he starts to pull away. When tragedy strikes again and Taylor once more loses someone close to him, he begins to realize he has been lying to himself all these years - he really does need love in his life."The Rescue" is a good, if light read. The beginning of the book will keep readers turning the pages, as they will want to find out if Kyle is okay. The love story between Denise and Taylor is well-done and very believable, especially on Taylor's side. All of the characters are believable. Denise is a great heroine, giving up her teaching career so she can devote her time to Kyle. She is a loving mother struggling to make enough money to raise her son, who is having a hard time speaking. The fact that she is not perfect makes her even more believable. There were a couple of times that I wished she was real so I could tell her to let Kyle just be a kid for once instead of spending all those hours trying to get him to talk. Taylor is also very believable - his anguish over his father's death, which he thinks is his fault, is heartbreaking. The supporting characters are also well done. Taylor's mother is the best written of the bunch - she befriends Denise when Kyle disappears knowing she is afraid and needs a friend. The fact that she knew Denise's mother as a child adds an extra dimension to both her and Denise's character. Taylor's best friend Mitch and Mitch's wife Melissa area an important part of the plot line. Author Nicholas Sparks certainly knows how to tell a story that will grab the readers attention although he does have a habit of repeating himself which is unnecessary in a book that is already over 400 pages long. And he relies a bit too much on cliched plot lines - there's a lot of foreshadowing and readers will figure out fairly quickly that there will be another tragedy and who the tragedy will involve. It's a shame because the book is good enough without the hackneyed plot line."The Rescue" is a good book to read on a rainy day.

Growing up, Rebecca listened to her beloved grandmother ("Gemma") recount the story of Briar Rose countless times. As Gemma lies dying, she tells Rebecca that she (Gemma) was Briar Rose and asks Becca to promise that she will look into Gemma's past. Becca agrees and embarks upon a journey to Poland that will open up past wounds but will also lead to a new beginning."Briar Rose" by Jane Yolen is a powerful novel about the Holocaust. Set in the present day with flashbacks to the Holocaust, it is an unforgettable story. Yolen skillfully weaves Gemma's recounting of the Briar Rose story with what really happened and it is heartbreaking and moving. The novel is filled with great characters - Becca, who agrees to find out Gemma's story and pledges to do so no matter what; Stan, her editor who encourages her to do so; Magda, the irrepressible Polish girl who helps Becca; Josef Potoki, who fills in many of the blanks in Gemma's life (his story is one of the most moving parts of the book); and of course Gemma herself as her story unfolds. Also playing a powerful part in the novel is the visit to Chelmno - not only the place itself but the reaction of the people living near there to the visitors. Gemma and Josef's stories are moving in many ways - a reminder of how much people lost during the Holocaust. The discoveries that Becca makes about Gemma and also the ones that she is unable to make are heartbreaking, yet heartwarming."Briar Rose" is a powerful work of fiction. Highly recommended.

Lori Shepherd is shocked when she discovers her "Aunt" Dimity has died. Shocked because she thought Aunt Dimity was a character her mother made up in bedtime stories. When Lori visits the law firm handling Dimity's estate, she discovers that Dimity wants her to travel to England and stay at her cottage while reading letters sent by her mother and Dimity and write a forward to Dimity's collection of stories. Lori can use a change; she is still reeling from the end of her marriage and her mother's unexpected death. Little does she realize this trip will change her life in many ways."Aunt Dimity's Death" is surprisingly multi-layered for the first book in an ongoing series. It's billed as a mystery, but it's more of a love story: not only a new romance for Lori; but romance during World War II (some of which end happily and many that don't); the love between a mother and child; and love between people who never met yet know of each other. It also has a touch of the supernatural, as Aunt Dimity's spirit is very much alive and, in a clever gimmick, is able to "talk" to Lori by writing in a journal. Finally, it's a novel about discovery, as Lori learns many things, not only about herself but also about her mother.This is an excellent start to the Aunt Dimity mystery series.

Molly Forrester writes an advice column for Zeitgeist, a Manhattan magazine. She'd like to write for a more prestigious magazine and sees her chance when Teddy Reynolds, advertising director for Zeitgeist, is murdered and she literally stumbles over his body at the magazine offices. Molly wants to try and sell the story of Teddy's murder from her viewpoint and decides to try and solve the murder herself as an additional selling point for the article. She has another incentive to solve the murder - hunky police detective Kyle Edwards seems to think Teddy's wife, Helen, killed him and Molly is convinced that the real killer works at the magazine. Soon Molly realizes that many people have secrets, secrets they want to keep, even if it means killing again."Killer Heels" is an excellent first book in what looks to be a fun series. Molly is a great heroine, both spunky and resourceful. Her best friends, Cassady and Tricia, are also likable. I'm not a "Sex and the City" fan and was a bit wary about reading a book with constant references to designer clothes and shoes, but they didn't bother me at all, in fact they added to the fun tone of the book. There's plenty of humor as well as suspense in the book. The mystery is well plotted with some red herrings along the way to keep a reader guessing who the murderer is.This is a nice humorous mystery and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

The Brew `N Go Coffeemaker makes one mug of coffee. It comes with a mug rest, travel mug with handle, mug lid, brew basket and permanent filter. Besides making coffee you can use the coffeemaker to brew hot water for other hot beverages such as tea, hot chocolate, instant oatmeal, soups, and more.What I like about the Brew `N Go Coffeemaker:The fact that it makes one cup of coffee. I'm the only one in the house who drinks coffee and this way, I'm not making a large pot that no one else drinks. It is very easy to use: using the travel mug you pour water into the water dispenser (when deciding how much water to use make sure to leave room for cream and sugar) that way you decide how much coffee to drink. After pouring the water, add milk, and whatever sweeteners you want to use into the mug, put the lid on the travel mug, and put it on the mug rest. Add the amount of coffee you want into the permanent filter, close the cover and turn the coffee pot on (another plus is the coffeemaker automatically shuts off when the brewing cycle is done). The coffee is ready in just a few minutes. The mug lid, brew basket, and permanent filter are very easy to clean. And since the travel mug is stainless steel there's no worry about it breaking while you're cleaning it. The coffee is quite tasty.What I don't like about the Brew `N Go Coffeemaker:It can be a bit messy. It is not always easy to judge how much water to put into the reservoir and my coffeemaker has dripped excess water a few times. Because the lid is on the travel mug during the brewing process it can get quite dirty (but it is very easy to clean). I like my coffee to be hot I it find the coffee isn't quite hot enough for my taste. The mug rest is not a warmer so I end up transferring the coffee to another cup that I can stick in the microwave to heat the coffee up. Also, when washing the travel mug water seems to get inside the lining and the mug leaks from the top were placed upside down after washing.Bottom-line:While there are a few things I don't like about the Brew `N Go Coffeemaker, there are a lot more things I do like about it and recommend it for anyone looking for a single cup coffee maker.

In this, the next to last book in Lemony Snicket's "Series of Unfortunate Events" books, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are taken by Kit Snicket to the Hotel Denouement where they are to work as concierges and spy on the guests to find out who is a volunteer for the mysterious VFD and who is a villain. While there, they run into many friends and enemies they have encountered in the previous 11 books in the series. They are all there in anticipation of a meeting of all VFD volunteers which is to take place in the next few days. But, as always, things do not go smoothly for the Baudelaire orphans and they end up accidentally murdering someone, purposely setting the hotel on fire, and in the crutches of the evil Count Olaf.Lemony Snicket fills this book with his trademark sense of humor, there are always 13 chapters, plenty of alliterative names, explanations of meanings of words, warnings that the reader shouldn't finish the book, and absurd situations (the roof top tanning scene is hilarious). The young Baudelaires are still far more intelligent than the adults are who never seem to recognize the children in their various disguises. Snicket gives a sly nod to critics who hated Olaf's laugh in "The Grim Grotto". While it's inevitable that the children grow up during the course of the books, the fact that Sunny speaks coherent sentences is a bit disappointing and takes away the fun of trying to decipher what she is saying.I appreciate the humor of having 13 books in the series, but I can't help wonder if that was ultimately too ambitious for Snicket. "The Penultimate Peril" feels like filler at times, with two many questions left unanswered. Why is the sugar bowl so important? Where are the Quagmire triplets? What do the initials "VFD" stand for? Are the Baudelaire's truly orphans or is one of their parents still alive? Where the Baudelaire parents involved in wrongdoing? Can Snicket answer all these questions in the last book?Finally, parents should be aware that there is a rather violent death toward the end of the book that is accidentally caused by the Baudelaire children. While this may open up an interesting discussion of what makes a person good or evil and can a person be both, the death may frighten young children.

After years of struggling to accept her psychic ability, Abby Cooper decides to put her gift to use and starts a business as a psychic intuitive. Her business is doing very well and she is booked months in advance. Abby sees so many clients she can't remember them all and even though she got an "icky" feeling while doing a reading for Allison Pierce, she soon forgets about her. But Allison is murdered and the police, skeptical about Abby's psychic powers, think Abby had something to do with the murder since she knows a lot about it. Abby, needing to clear her name, beings to investigate Allison's life and death. Hunky police detective Dutch Rivers is soon convinced of her innocence but is unhappy that Abby is investigating the case because he realizes the real killer is dangerous. Abby soon realizes she should have listened to Dutch as she faces very real danger."Abby Cooper: Psychic Eye" is a wonderful debut novel in what promises to be a fun cozy mystery series. Author Victoria Laurie does a good job of explaining how Abby's psychic powers came to be and how the psychic mind works. There's a nice sense of humor throughout the book, especially when Abby does her readings. Abby is a fully developed character, with Laurie giving little tidbits about Abby's relationship with her parents, plus good insight into her relationship with her sister, Cat, who is another great character. Abby's relationship with Dutch is also well done and realistic as she struggles to accept that he is a cop who doesn't want her involved in the case and he struggles to accept her psychic abilities. As for the mystery itself, while the murder and motive are all too real and tragic, armchair sleuths may be disappointed that they don't really have a chance to figure out who the murderer is. Still, it is the characters that make this book so enjoyable and worth reading.I really enjoyed reading "Abby Cooper: Psychic Eye" and have already picked up the next book in the series. Well done.

No longer in paperback format, "Guinness World Records" is an oversized hardcover jam packed with brief articles, lots of pictures, and a few trading cards. New records have a red star next to them; broken or updated records have a yellow star next to them. Guinness has several unique features throughout the book. Records holders, such as insects, are shown at their actual size whenever possible. Scattered throughout the book are bits of trivia about certain records. There are a handful of interviews included in the book. There are also some fold out pages in the book. At the very end of the book are recently set records that just made it into the book at press time."Guinness World Records" is a mixed bag. It's geared toward the younger crowd - it's oversized with tons of pictures and the articles are all over the place instead of in neat columns. Some of the records are quite interesting; for example the section with the youngest and oldest person to hold certain records is fascinating. Also interesting are the one minute records which include records such as how many chin ups or cartwheels a person can do in one minute (although I could have done without reading about how many cockroaches a person can eat in one minute, accompanied by a picture of him with cockroaches all over his face - yuck). Some of the more interesting records are the ones about planet earth, science, and some of the sporting ones. The disease and medicine section is very interesting. Some of the records, while interesting, could have used more details like what happened to the seal that was afraid of water. Some of the other "records" such as the ones in the celebrity section seem shallow. Guinness itself adds to the shallowness by holding a Guinness World Record Day every November 9th. This is an open invitation for people to attempt frivolous records such as the most socks worn on one foot. Other records, such as the one for Doom 3, were not verified and should not have been included in the book. It would be interesting to see how Guinness chooses who will be in the book; it surprised me that there was no mention of Japanese eating champion Takeru Kobayshi in the food and eating section. The interviews in the book are quite brief, but the one with Sergei Krikalive, who has spent more time in space than any other human being, was very interesting and I wish it had been longer. The trading cards have pictures on the front with records and other information on the back but I'm not sure how collectible they really are. Guinness offers a "Memory Challenge" in which you can have someone read to you a list of objects on the page and you try to recite them back in order. If you feel you can memorize enough to set a record, you can apply to Guinness to try and break the record."Guinness World Records" has some interesting records and features, but it's not as good as it used to be.

For several years, Bart and Jennifer Corbin seemed to have the perfect marriage - including a nice house and two young sons. But there are cracks in the marriage - Bart is having an affair and is too controlling and Jenn starts to look for love elsewhere. Jenn decides to leave Bart and is finally happy, which is why, when her body is found with a single gunshot wound to the head, her family doesn't believe it was suicide. The police aren't convinced either and start digging into Bart's past. Soon they discover that Jenn's not the first loved one Bart has lost - a former girlfriend, Dolly Hearn, also died from a gunshot wound to the head."Too Late to Say Goodbye" is Ann Rule's page turning account of the true story of murderer Bart Corbin and his victims Jenn Corbin and Dolly Hearn. As she does so well, Rule recreates the lives of the victims in such a way that by the end of the book readers feel as if they knew Jen and Dolly. Rule also does a good job of looking into Brad's life and what led him to kill. It is creepy to read what Brad did to Dolly after she broke up with him and frustrating to read as she never quite realized how obsessive he was and how the authorities never quite took her seriously. Some of the most interesting parts of the book are as the investigators reopen Dolly's case and step by step prove Bart killed her as well as Jenn.Jenn's case is the most recent and more sensational (she was involved in an on-line romance that took a very odd twist) but Rule gives equal room to both murders. She is also sensitive to the twists and turns of Jenn's obsession with the on-line game Everquest and her on-line romance - she writes about it matter-of-factly without sensationalizing it. The book is full of pictures of all involved and the pictures of Dolly and Jenn serve to emphasize what a loss both their families suffered."Too Late to Say Goodbye" is Ann Rule at her best.

In this book by Sandra Brown, Paris Gibson is host of a late night radio program where she plays music and talks to listeners, sometimes giving them advice. As the book opens, Paris receives a phone call from someone calling himself "Valentino", saying he has kidnapped his girlfriend and will kill her within 72 hours. Paris goes to the police and runs into an old flame, Dr. Dean Malloy. Paris and Dean struggle with the past as well as their feelings for each other, while trying to find Valentino before he kills his girlfriend.This is another exciting thriller by Sandra Brown. She is expert at giving just enough information that makes you keep turning the pages to find out more. There are plenty of suspects who could be Valentino and his identity is not revealed until the exciting climax of the book. I highly recommend this book, but don't start it too late at night or you may find yourself staying up all night to finish it!

The Finishing Touch is designed to easily and safely remove hair from sensitive areas. It comes with a light so you can see even the smallest hair that needs to be removed. It also comes with a Precision Safety Blade Wand; eyebrow comb attachment; brush for cleaning; and an instruction manual. It uses one AAA battery (not included).As a woman of a certain age I've found that I've had to spend a lot of time plucking facial hairs that have begun to sprout up - a painful and time-consuming process. When someone told me about The Finishing Touch I was a bit skeptical but she insisted it worked so I tried it. To my delight it does a good job. I have very sensitive skin and was a bit nervous about using The Finishing Touch but it doesn't hurt my skin at all - in fact it is far less painful than plucking hair. The light is an added bonus to help see hair that needs to be removed (especially since my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be). The Finishing Touch does a great job of removing unwanted facial hair. Granted it is not as thorough as plucking hair and you'll have to use it more often than you would when you pluck hair. However, I'd rather use it more often than suffer the pain that comes with plucking facial hair.The Finishing Touch does a good job.

"311 Pelican Court", the third book in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series, focuses mainly on the divorce of Zach and Rosie Cox. Judge Olivia Lockhart has decreed that while Zach and Rosie will split custody, their children will stay in one house, and Zach and Rosie will move back and forth between houses. This unique arrangement will change their relationship in a way they never could have imagined. Olivia is struggling with her own relationship issues as she has to decide between getting back together with her ex-husband Stan or continue her relationship with newspaperman Jack Griffin. Grace Sherman, still recovering from her husband's death, gets caught up in an online relationship, neglecting her would be suitor, Cliff Harding. Grace's daughter, Maryellen, has her own problems in her relationship with Jon Bowman, the father of her newborn daughter. Finally, the whole town wonders about the identity of the mysterious man found dead at Peg and Bob Beldon's bed and breakfast place."311 Pelican Court" is a warm entry in Debbie Macomber's soap opera-like Cedar Cove series. Macomber deftly interweaves each person's story, switching between them swiftly, so if you don't like one character's story, one you will like quickly follows. Of all the stories, I found Grace's addiction to her online relationship to be the most compelling and realistic. Macomber is a good story teller, but her writing can be awkward at times and her plot devices could sometimes use more thinking out, as when Grace tried to trick Olivia into going to the movies because Jack was there. That scene was totally unbelievable. Still, the stories are interesting enough that it's easy to overlook the sometimes clumsy writing.This was a nice cozy read.

"44 Cranberry Point", the fourth book in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series, focuses mainly on solving the mystery of the man who died while staying at Bob and Peggy Beldon's Bed and Breakfast. Cedar Cove in general is excited about a "dog and bachelor" auction fundraiser, but several of the residents also have other things on their mind. Jon Bowman and Maryellen Sherman are in love and have a child, but disagree about Jon's relationship with his parents. Grace Sherman is still dealing with the consequences of her on-line romance with Will Jefferson, and wondering if Cliff Harding will ever forgive her. Newly married Olivia and Jack Griffin are struggling to adapt to each other's lifestyles - she's a neat freak and he's a slob, plus she worries about his eating habits. And who is sending Roy McAfee those mysterious messages?Out of the four books I've read so far in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series, I liked this one the best. I enjoyed the plot line about the man who died while staying at the B & B, although the identity of the murderer was pretty obvious. Macomber does a great job describing Bob Beldon's struggle with alcoholism, especially at one point when he almost gives in to his cravings. Other characters are equally well written especially Jon Bowman and his troubled relationship with his parents. Macomber introduces several new characters and sets up an interesting love triangle between hairdresser Rachel, single dad Bruce, and navy man Nate, who has a girlfriend back home. Finally, she ends the book with a cliffhanger, which makes me want to immediately pick up the next book in the series."44 Cranberry Point" is a nice, cozy read.

This book is very useful in answering questions homeowners may have about renovating their homes. The format features questions, the answers "yes" or "no" with checkboxes next to them with room underneath for note taking, and a detailed explanation with tips and hints. For the most part this format works well, although I wish that author Robert Irwin had varied the answers a bit since not every question can be answered "yes" or "no", for example "when will you do the job?"The first four chapters in the book focus on general questions about home renovations such as hiring a contractor and financing the job. The rest of the book focuses on certain areas to be renovated, for example there's one chapter on renovating the bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen; another on installing cabinets; and another on installing floors. This is really helpful since the homeowner can read just the chapter that focuses on the repair work they want to do. The questions that Irwin asks are very helpful and he doesn't hesitate to say whether or not you should tackle the job yourself or hire someone to do it.Very useful.

In this book, one of the best books in the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling begins to tie together events in the previous books, as well as building the groundwork for the final book in the series. She's a master storyteller and readers will marvel at how seemingly innocuous scenes and characters in the earlier books prove to be meaningful after all.One of the best things about this series is how the characters mature through the course of the books. Harry has thankfully matured since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and is far less angry and far more thoughtful. Romance is in the air now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are older, but romance isn't just for the young as we get glimpses of the enduring love between Arthur and Molly Weasley, the engagement of Fleur and bill, and another romance between the adults that put a smile on my face. But there are different types of love, and this book, even more than the others, shows how important the friendship and love between Harry and his friends (and teachers) is, and will, I suspect, play an even bigger part in the last book.In between romantic interludes, there is, of course, school lessons, but outside of Potions lessons and Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, the book doesn't focus much on them. Even Hermione seems a bit more relaxed about schoolwork. Quidditch too, while still important to Ron and Harry, seems to be less consuming to them as it once was.I'm puzzled as to why critics continue to refer to these as children's books as the series ceased to be just for children several books ago. Younger, children, in fact, may have a hard time dealing with certain events in this book.This continues to be an outstanding series. Rowling answers many questions in this book, yet creates even more questions that leave the reader hungry for the next book. I can't wait!

Leslie Sansone's "Walk the Walk" features two in-home walking workouts set to Christian music. The first workout is a one mile workout; the second workout is two miles long.One Mile WorkoutLasting about twenty minutes, this workout is perfect for beginners, especially those new to Leslie's in-home walking programs. This workout features just Leslie and is slow-paced which is good for beginners but may be a bit too slow for those who are used to Leslie's workouts. (I return to this workout if I've been unable to exercise for awhile and need something to ease my way back in to exercising). The workout features all of Leslie's standard moves: walk in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, kick backs, walk forward and back. Leslie explains each move before she does it. One of the things I like about Leslie is that she makes it seem like she is talking directly to you throughout the workout. The Christian music is nice but unobtrusive, never interfering with the workout.Two Mile WorkoutLasting about 35 minutes, this two mile workout is good for those who have mastered the one mile walk and want to try something a bit more strenuous. Featuring Leslie with two other women, this is one of her easiest two mile workouts. Again it features the usual Leslie moves: walk in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, kick backs, walk forward and back and nothing extra like double knee lifts that are featured in some of her other two miles walks. This is a good workout for those who are new to two mile workouts as well as for those who want to do two miles without overexerting themselves. The one major difference in this workout is that during the stretches after the workout a minister friend of Leslie speaks. His speech is inspiring and don't be surprised if you walk around saying "I love you" after doing this workout.Long-time fans of Leslie may not find these two workouts challenging enough, but they are perfect for those who are new to in-home walking.

"Land of the Lost" is a classic example of what Saturday morning children's television shows were like in the `70's. Forest Ranger Rick Marshall and his two children, Will and Holly, fall through a hole in time and land in a world full of menacing dinosaurs and evil creatures known as "Sleestaks". The Marshall's learn how to survive in this strange land, with the help of Chaka and his people, the monkey-like Pakuni's, all the while looking for a way back home.One of the things I love about DVD's (especially the one's put out by Rhino) is that they offer a chance to revisit my childhood. I loved "Land of the Lost" as a child (actually a young teenager) and I loved watching the first season all over again as an adult. Yes, thirty years later, the special effects (especially the dinosaurs) are lame, the sets are cheesy, and the acting over the top at times, but that's part of the fun of watching the show. We know the dinosaurs aren't real and the Sleestaks are lumbering fools who can't shoot an arrow straight and I loved every minute of it! Most of the episodes were okay, and a couple were excruciating to watch, but there are some really inventive episodes including "Album", "The Search", "Elsewhen" and the season ending episode "Circle".The bonus features are also worth watching. My favorites were the two episodes where Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman did the commentary. They recall the show fondly, give some interesting trivia about the episodes, and make some hilarious comments about the acting and special effects. Eure is especially funny and does not hesitate to poke fun at himself.Great fun!

The second season of "Land of the Lost" was in many ways the best season. The Marshalls had settled in and made real beds, cooking utensils, knives, even fishing poles. Sure, the special effects were still cheesy and some things were left unexplained - like how did the Marshalls keep their clothes so clean and unwrinkled when they wore them 24 hours a day (even sleeping in them) and how did Holly manage to braid her hair so perfectly every day. But cheesiness was part of the fun of "Land of the Lost" and there were some truly outstanding episodes in the second season. The Zarn, a creature made out of lights that changed colors depending on his emotions appeared in several episodes and was a great addition to the show. One outstanding episode is "One of Our Pylons is Missing" in which Chaka, Holly, and Rick fall through a hole in the ground into what is basically the heart of the Land of the Lost. This episode shows how good the show was for a Saturday morning low budget kid's show. Other very good episodes include "The Musician" and "Blackout".As with the first season, the bonus features are also good, especially when Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman (Will and Holly) do the commentating. Eure also hosts a fun trivia quiz based on the first two seasons. The interview with Walker Edminston (Enik) was very interesting, especially when he talks about how uncomfortable the Sleestak outfits were and why Enik wore a vest in each episode.The second season of "Land of the Lost" is great nostalgic fun.

Jane Jeffry's friend, Shelley Nowack, has agreed to find caterers to provide meals for participants in a play the local community college is putting on and asks Jane to help her. Jane agrees, figuring she can work on her latest hobby, needlepoint, while watching the rehearsal. She also hopes to get some ideas for a new book that she is writing. But Jane gets more than she bargained for when an actor in the play is murdered and the janitor at the theater is attacked. Jane's longtime boyfriend, police Detective Mel van Dyne, in investigating the case and asks for Jane's help as she knows the cast and crew quite well. Jane has plenty of suspects for Mel, including the director-playwright, Steven Imry and all the cast members.Jill Churchill's last Jane Jeffrey mystery "Bell, Book, and Scandal" was pretty bad but I had hoped that was just a one-time thing. Unfortunately, "A Midsummer Night's Scream" is almost as bad, if not worse. Outside of Jane's success as a novelist, there is no character development and the only new interesting character is Gloria Bunting. The writing is stiff and some passages, such as the needlepoint class instructions seem like they are quoted from books. The dialogue is awkward and artificial and at least once Churchill loses track of which character is speaking. Even cozy bits, such as Jane's cat catching a mole are badly written and feel forced.The Jane Jeffry mystery series used to be a light, cozy, pleasant read and it's a shame to see the series go downhill so fast. I recommend reading the other books in the series and skipping the last two. Hopefully that the next one will be better and puts the series back on track.

Someone is sending anonymous postcards to Corrie and Roy McAfee who live at "50 Harbor Street" in Cedar Cove, Washington. Roy is a private investigator who initially thinks the postcards refer to a past case of his, but he soon suspects otherwise. Their daughter Linette recently moved to Cedar Cove to work at the new health center. She is attracted to Dr. Chad Timmons, but much to her dismay, while he doesn't seem interested in her, ranch worker Cal Washburn is. Other residents in Cedar Cove have their own problems and worries. Judge Olivia Lockhart Griffin worries about her husband's weight and eating habits and pushes him to exercise with disastrous consequences. Olivia's mother Charlotte recently married Ben Rhodes and is pleased when Ben's son David reaches out to her, but Ben warns her that David may not be what he seems to be. Navy wife Cecilia Randall is pregnant, but having lost a baby daughter shortly after giving birth, she is very nervous about losing this baby and it doesn't help that her husband Ian is at sea. Cecilia isn't the only one worried about her pregnancy, Maryellen Bowman is pregnant and having complications that may force her husband Jon to make a painful decision."50 Harbor Street" is a good soap opera like book. Debbie Macomber is a good storyteller who creates characters that are real and that readers care about. Although the book focuses mainly on the McAfee's, there are numerous subplots going on. Macomber will focus on one set of characters in one chapter, another set in the next chapter, yet another set in the next and so on throughout the book which can be confusing. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for which character is featured and I often had to flip back to see what had happened several chapters back. There is a character guide in the front of the book, which is helpful, but in the future it would be better if Macomber cut back on the number of plots and characters in the books. With so many characters, Macomber does an amazing job of continuity through all the books (this is the fifth in an ongoing series), even referencing things in past books, although there is no mention of Nate's girlfriend which was a conflict in his relationship with Rachel in past books. While some of the plots in the book are unique, like the threatening postcards, other plots are a bit repetitive - isn't there one woman in Cedar Cove that can have a complication free pregnancy?Fans of Debbie Macomber and especially fans of her Cedar Cove series will enjoy this book.

Bed and Breakfast owner Judith McMonigle Flynn badly needs a vacation and when her cousin Serena (Renie) is invited to go on a free 1930's themed cruise, Judith agrees to go along. But murder has a habit of finding Judith and before the cruise can even get underway, the body of their host, Magglio Cruz, is found stuffed in a piano. With nothing else to do until their ship sails, Judith and Renie, along with the help of fellow passengers Rick and Rhoda St. George, decide to investigate the murder. They better find the killer soon - dead bodies are starting to pile up and none of them wants to be the next victim."Dead Man Docking" is a good, if over the top cozy mystery. Author Mary Daheim takes the 1930's cruise theme to the extreme creating characters straight out of a 1930's movie. Rick and Rhoda St. George (and their dog Asthma) are the best examples of this as they are thinly disguised takeoffs on Nick and Nora Charles. All of this is very amusing but not very believable. Daheim seems to have had a lot of fun writing the book which makes it fun to read, although the humor can be a bit much (Daheim relies a bit too much on puns at times and some of the characters, like the maid are stereotypical to the point of being offensive). The murder mystery elements are fine, although it's hard to believe people would open up as easily as they do to Judith and Renie. Also Judith and Renie tell people that are practically strangers far too much information when for all they know they could be talking to a murderer. There are plenty of suspects (and dead bodies!) and readers will have fun trying to figure out who the killer is. Unfortunately the scene where the killer is revealed is, like most of the book, way over the top and totally unbelievable. I was hoping that Daheim would put in a twist regarding the killer, but she didn't take any chances in this book which is too bad."Dead Man Docking" is a good but over the top cozy mystery.

Leslie Sansone's "Five Day Slim Down" features five one mile walks (each targeting different areas); a warm-up session; a cool down session; and five super breakfast meal plans.Day 1: Classic Walk:This 14 minute mile is exactly what it says - a classic Leslie Sansone mile. It features her four basic steps: walking in place; side steps; kicks; and knee lifts. There is nothing too difficult - she does do some walking back and forth and double side steps but that is it. It is a pretty good workout but for some reason the entire workout only has one set of knee lifts.Day 2: Sculpt Your Arms:This is another 14 minute walk. It is more intense than Day 1 as it includes things like tap outs (later in the workout she turns the tap outs to lunges) and double knee lifts. While this focuses on the arms and includes things like bicep curls, there are no weights involved, although you could easily add them if you want to ramp up the workout. There is an odd editing glitch in this one, as if Leslie had more time left than she realized and needed to add more exercises, which can be a bit distracting.Day 3: Slim Your Legs:This 14 minute mile is pretty intense and a good workout - perhaps my favorite on the entire DVD. You modify the four basic steps by doing things like lifting your knees while doing side steps; tapping while doing side steps; and tapping with your heels while doing side steps. She even throws in a grapevine instead of side steps. To slim the legs she incorporates squats and lunges (she shows you how to modify them if you want). While there is another one of those unfortunate editing glitches, this is basically an excellent workout.Day 4: Trim Your Tummy:This is another intense 14 minute mile that starts out pretty intense from the beginning as Leslie quickly has you do tap outs (later the tap outs turn to lunges). To work on the tummy, Leslie uses several moves like kick backs (hamstring curls) and adding a kick while walking back and forth. The big thing here is that there are lots of knee lifts - single knee lifts, double knee lifts, four knee lifts - done several times throughout the workout. This is another of my favorite workouts on this DVD.Day 5: Speed Walk:The final walk on the DVD is a 12 minute mile in which Leslie amps up all her regular moves. While there are only single knee lifts in this workout, she adds some twists to her other movements. You do sidesteps while walking up and back; instead of regular side steps you tap after the fourth step; you do tap outs that turn to lunges; at one point you even jog back and forth. Leslie also adds some enhanced arm movements that make this quite an effective workout in just 12 minutes.Warm Up, Cool Down, and Super Breakfasts:The warm-up lasts for approximately five minutes and incorporates Leslie's four basis steps as well as some walking back and forth and some arm movements to warm up the upper body. The cool down is a nice leisurely nine minute segment that feels great after the workout. The stretching segment of the cool down is six minutes long and even incorporates some modified yoga poses. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the super breakfast segment but I was pleasantly surprised as Leslie showed not only scrambled eggs, french toast, oatmeal and smoothies, but a grab and go breakfast (yogurt, cereal, bars) that are so often eaten during a busy day.Conclusion:For the most part this is a pretty good exercise DVD. The workouts are diverse and offer you the choice of doing a one mile workout, a two mile workout, etc. and you can mix and match which workouts you want to do each day. My one wish is that this was programmable - instead the workouts blend into each other (which is fine only if you want to do them in the order they are on the DVD), and you have to stop at the end of each workout to pick the next one (the same thing happens when you want to do the cool down). Also, while Leslie mentions several times that you can do a quick mile when you don't have a lot of time, the cool down is very long so even a "quick" mile takes half an hour. Still, I found all the workouts on the DVD to be effective and I like the idea of mixing and matching what part of the body I want to focus on during a workout.

While digging for clams, Donna Galbreath stumbles across the body of Lyle Corrigan. He had plenty of enemies that wanted to kill him and Donna doesn't trust the abilities of local police chief Billy Donniker to solve the case so she starts investigating the murder herself. Add in a second murder and a couple of attempted, near fatal poisonings and Donna has her hands full. She believes the deaths may have links to the past, but when she gets too close to the truth, she has to be careful or she may become a victim herself."Donna Rose and the Slug War" is an enjoyable cozy mystery. The book is written in the first person and Donna Rose is a great, if somewhat acerbic heroine. She says exactly what is on her mind and doesn't care if people like what she has to say. Still, she is likable, especially in her relationship with her daughter Roberta who is separated from her husband. Her relationship with next door neighbor Cyrus Bates makes for some of the funniest moments in the book (including the slug war of the title) and author Norma Tadlock Johnson deserves a lot of credit for letting readers decide for themselves whether or not Donna Rose dislikes Cyrus as much as she says she does. Johnson also does a good job in depicting the other characters in the novel and depicting small town life. The mystery itself is well written and the unmasking of the murderer will not doubt sadden readers when the motive is revealed."Donna Rose and the Slug War" is nicely done.

Boston college student Sarah Markham is convinced that she was adopted and hires PI Sunny Randall to find out the truth. Sarah's parents insist that she isn't adopted but they say they can't find her birth certificate and they both refuse to take a DNA test. The Markham's are so vague and uncooperative when Sunny questions them she is sure they are lying and sets out to find the truth about Sarah's birth. Sunny is also finding out some truths about herself - her ex-husband is getting married and she sees a psychiatrist (Susan Silverman of Robert Parker's Spenser series) to deal with her conflicted feelings about her, her ex, and her parents.This is the first non-Spenser Robert Parker book I've read and I was a bit apprehensive thinking Sunny would just be Spenser in a skirt. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, Sunny has some of the same characteristic traits as Spenser, including being a dog owner and having a sidekick she can call on if she's in trouble (gay Spike is Sunny's Hawk). But Sunny is a more complex character than Spenser and her visits to Susan Silverman, interspersed with her search for the truth about Sarah's parents, add a dimension to this book that's missing from the Spenser series. While it's interesting and refreshing to see Susan Silverman from the viewpoint of someone other than Spenser, Parker's a little too in love with his own character and his repetitive descriptions of Susan's manicured nails wear thin very quickly. Parker's writing is mostly dialogue driven and doesn't vary much beyond "I said", "he said", and "she said". Still, Parker has a keen sense of humor and his new character, Detective second-grade Eugene Corsetti, is a perfect example of Parker at his best.This was a quick, enjoyable book to read.

The four Penderwick sisters (Rosalind, Skye, Jane, and Batty) are excited to be staying at an estate called Arundel for their summer vacation. Arundel is like nothing they've ever seen before - it is large and beautiful. They quickly make friends with Jeffrey, the son of the owner of Arundel, but his mother is less enchanted with the girls and how Jeffrey reacts to their friendship. The Penderwick girls will forever change Jeffrey's relationship with his mother - but for the good or the bad?"The Penderwicks" is a delightful book aimed at children ages 9 to 12. Author Jeanne Birdsall has created a book that manages to combine modern elements to capture children's attention (their father has a computer) yet old-fashioned elements that will remind adults of beloved books they read as children (Rosalind writes letters to her best friend rather than e-mails). The book is told alternately from each child's point of view and each is a memorable character: Rosalind, trying to be a mother to each child and suffering her first crush; tomboy Skye; dreamer Jane who is always writing a novel; and young Batty, a nervous, shy child who loves wearing her beloved butterfly wings. The story is a simple one - children being children - that vaguely reminded me of "Little Women" (without the tragedy). There is a wonderful sense of humor throughout the book that children will love and adults will enjoy looking back to the innocent days of childhood. If there is a flaw in this book, it is the portrayal of the adults. Mr. Penderwick is a typical absent-minded professor, who unknowingly neglects his children and relies far too much on Rosalind. Jeffrey's mother is a stereotypical villain, whose character could use some fleshing out. Still, the book is really about the Penderwick sisters and Jeffrey and their story is a delight to read.Readers of all ages will enjoy "The Penderwicks".

Money is tight for Judith McGonigle Flynn and her cousin Renie. Judith's Bed and Breakfast isn't attracting as many customers as it used to and Renie isn't getting any offers for her graphic design work and is seriously in debt. Judith is also dealing with Rudi, a neighbor who likes to practice his violin at all hours of the night. To top it all off, Judith's latest guests are an odd bunch and she's not too happy when one of them is murdered. Add in Renie's missing credit cards and Rudi's missing violin bow and Judith and Renie are knee deep in murder and mayhem - yet again."Saks and Violins" is an okay entry in Mary Daheim's Bed and Breakfast cozy mystery series. All of the characters that make the series so enjoyable - Judith, Renie, Judith's husband Joe, and her mother Gertrude - are in this book. The gentle sense of humor in the series is also in this book. But this book seems over the top, even for this series. Judith's neighbor Arlene is a perfect example. She's always been nosy, but she takes it to a new level in this book with her probing. Renie's worrying about her debts never quite worked for me as she was still wearing $2,000 outfits. The reaction of the 911 operator was no doubt meant to be funny but struck me as unprofessional instead. Judith's worrying over her artificial hip wore thin quickly - isn't the point of getting a new hip that one walks better with it? As for the mystery elements, for me the biggest problem was that there were too many characters and I got confused as to who was who and how they were related to each other. However, the mystery itself is well plotted, with plenty of suspects and red herrings and readers will have a hard time figuring out whodunit."Saks and Violins" is an okay cozy mystery.

When Sir George Braxton is found lying face down in a fountain with the back of his skull smashed in, no one mourns the murder victim. His three daughters certainly don't: Lucinda, the oldest, is free now to marry the man she loves; Nina had lost a lot of money in bad investments and fears her father's wrath; and Charlotte, the youngest, was trying to hide a serious gambling problem. There are plenty of other suspects, including two houseguests; a cousin who lives permanently at the house; the gardener, who has a criminal past; and the servants, whom Sir George has been less than kind to. Home Security calls in Inspector Gerald Witherspoon to solve the case with one catch - they want the murder solved by Christmas, which is a week away! Good thing the Inspector has Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of his household staff working behind the scenes to help him!This is another excellent entry in a wonderful series. Emily Brightwell equally shows Witherspoon's investigation and the servant's efforts, which gives insight into all the characters. I like the fact that, while the servants to help Witherspoon, he does turn up important evidence and grows more confident in every book. These books give a good insight into what life was like for servants in the Victorian Age, comparing Witherspoon's treatment of his servants to the way Braxton treated his. As much as I enjoy the series, I can't help but wonder how the dynamic of the books will change when Smythe and Betsy finally do marry.The mystery itself is well written and well plotted. Seemingly innocent conversations about things like missing chicken livers turn out to be important clues. And the revelation of what the murder weapon was is a surprise and well done.This series keeps getting better and better. I've read the entire series and there's not a bad book among them. Highly recommended!

"The Lost Chronicles" is a nice look inside the making of the hit TV show. The book tells how the pilot of the show was conceived and then filmed; has lots of pictures and interviews with the cast and crew; and a recap of every episode in the first season. There's also an in-depth report on the day by day filming of the episode "In Translation". Also included is a DVD with a behind the scenes look at how they prepared the plane used in the pilot episode; interviews with some of the cast; and some deleted scenes.For the most part, this is a great companion guide to the TV Series "Lost". The behind the scenes details are fascinating including how they planned to initially kill off Jack and why the producers decided not to do so. The explanation of why they used certain plot devices was also interesting. The interviews with the actors and actresses were fun to read. Especially fascinating was the chapter the covered the filming of one episode - it's amazing how much work is done to film one episode.Unfortunately, the weakest part of the book is the episode guide. It's written in diary form, but no one person on the island would be able to know what was going on in other character's minds. I was hoping for a more detailed recap with an explanation of both what happened in "real" time and what happened in the flashbacks. I was also hoping for a mention of the "Easter eggs" that happen in most episodes (i.e. Sawyer being taken into custody while Boone is at the police station looking for Shannon). These Easter eggs are an integral part of the show and I was disappointed that they weren't even mentioned in the book.Other than the episode recaps, I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to Lost fans.

In this second installment of the increasingly delightful Flower Shop Mysteries, Abby Knight, owner of a struggling flower shop, is not only a bridesmaid in her cousin Jill's upcoming wedding, she is in charge of the flower arrangements, which will bring much needed money into her shop. As if Abby didn't have enough to do, when one of the men in the wedding party disappears and another is murdered, Jill insists that Abby solve the murder. Abby has no choice but to agree (she really needs the money from the wedding) and as she investigates she finds herself surrounded by suspects. Abby also is convinced that there's a prostitution ring in town, so she starts to investigate that as well, thinking the two might be connected. Not everyone is happy with her meddling and Abby needs to solve the case soon before she becomes the next victim.I liked this book much better than the first one in the series "Mum's The Word". Abby is much more likable and, unlike the first book, her involvement in the murder investigation is understandable. Unfortunately, her "meddling" in the prostitution ring, although a necessary plot point, is not as well explained. And Abby still does some stupid things that strain a reader's patience, like photographing in broad daylight license plates of men that she thinks are visiting the alleged prostitutes. The other characters are well drawn: Marco, the hunky ex-cop is not as much a clich&eacute; as in the first book; Grace and Lottie, Abby's coworkers, are delightful; Jill, Abby's cousin, is shallow and stupid, as are much of the wedding party outside of Bertie, whom I'd like to have seen more of. I'd also like to see more of Abby`s roommate, Nikki, perhaps she'll get more involved in solving cases in future books.There are some minor flaws in this mystery, but there are some nicely humorous scenes (it's worth reading just to see what Abby's mother's latest sculpture is) and I can't wait to read the next one!

The "Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout" DVD lets you create your own workout. First you do the warm-up exercise which the DVD randomly selects from three choices. After the warm-up you pick what area you want to work on: Upper Body, Lower Body, Abs, or Total Body and which level of intensity you want - Level I (easier) or Level 2 (harder). Next you get to pick how long you want to work out which can range from one minute to 72 minutes depending on what area you are targeting and what level you are working at. Each exercise is approximately one minute long and many of the exercises require either a set of light weights or a heavier set of weights. After exercising you select the cool down exercise which again is randomly selected from three options. There are also two Fast Track Workouts if you are pressed for time - the Level 1 Fast Track Workout is three minutes long and the Level 2 Fast Track Workout is four minutes long. There is also a seven minute Bonus Stretch Segment as well as segments explaining how the program works and how to get the most out of the DVD."Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout" is a great way of toning your body. I consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercising and I really appreciate the fact that I can choose the length and intensity of my workout. I use Level 1 and while I don't break out in a sweat like I do when using other exercise DVD's, I do feel like I've gotten a complete workout by the time I'm through. I found the one minute length of each exercise to be perfect, especially since if an exercise was a bit too difficult for me I could either still do it in the one minute or skip it altogether without harming my exercise routine. The DVD claims to have over 115 different exercises (there's a chart listing them all) so most of the time each exercise program is different, but I have seen some exercises repeated while I exercise. I do the Total Body Toning (Level 1) and the exercises either involve standing up or floor exercise with no apparent rhyme or reason as to which is next and it can be a bit frustrating to have to switch from one to the other with no warning. There is a brief transition period between each exercise, which may annoy some, but I found it a perfect way to catch my breath before going onto the next exercise. While the DVD says weights are optional, the majority of exercises I've done require either light weights or heavier weights. The warm up and cool down sections are very helpful, especially the cool down which I find very effective. I like Minna Lessig as an instructor; she's very pleasant, calm, and encouraging.I find "Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout" to be very helpful.

Isobel Barrington comes from a small but loving family and works as a private nurse to supplement her mother's pension and help her younger brother through school. She is hired by Dr. Thomas Winters to help bring his old Nanny to England from Poland. Isobel is happy to take the job, the pay is good, Nanny is a delight, and she has a chance to do a little sightseeing. Isobel's content with her lot in life until she realizes that she's fallen in love with Thomas. She feels that she has no chance to win his heart, she's rather plain and he has rich beautiful girlfriend named Ella."Never Say Goodbye" is Betty Neel's at her best. She changes her usual plot a bit - Thomas is English, not Dutch - but otherwise she uses one of my favorite formulas in this book - poor, plain, but gentle girl from a nice family falls in love with a rich, handsome doctor. Neels throws in a beautiful but mean-hearted girlfriend for the doctor and a family crisis for Isobel as well. Nothing new here, but Betty Neels had a special gift of being able to turn a simple romance into a heartwarming love story. Although there is no doubt who will win Thomas's heart, readers will root for Isobel the whole way, hating Ella.This is a good book to read when you wish to escape from the real world for a couple of hours.

After my cats broke my last set of bedroom lamps (made out of glass) I was looking for a nice looking, sturdy, inexpensive set of lamps (no sense in spending a lot of money on something they might break). I've been very happy with this lamp. It is short (a bit shorter than I expected) and very sturdy. I got the burgundy color because my bedroom set is cherry and it fits right in with my decorating scheme. I got two lamps - one for each end of my bureau and together they make a nice soft light (each takes a 60 watt bulb) that is perfect for both reading and watching television. And the lamps are indeed very sturdy - they've already survived being knocked over several times by the cats!

Susan Henshaw, her husband Jed, and their two children, Chrissy and Chad, are on a skiing vacation at Yellowstone National Park when they meet the Ericksen clan who are there for a family reunion. While the younger Henshaws quickly become friends with the youngest members of the Ericksen clan, Susan and Jed discover that the older Ericksen's are a dysfunctional family, especially patriarch George who dominates the entire family while his wife Phyllis tries to keep calm. Son Carlton is an alcoholic who had to leave the country to escape his father and stop drinking; and youngest son Darcy's homosexuality is not accepted by his father. The family seems to be constantly fighting and it's not long before someone murders both George and Darcy's lover. Most of the family thinks Darcy is the killer, but his mother isn't convinced and asks Susan, who has solved some murders in the past, to investigate."An Old Faithful Murder" is a good cozy mystery. I liked the skiing aspects, I've only been skiing once and I could fully emphasize with Susan as she learned how to ski. The mystery itself was well plotted with the identity of the murderer being a surprise as well as the motive. Wolzien's decision to have a housewife as the detective is an interesting one, especially since Susan's closest friend, Kathleen, is an ex-police woman who agrees to help with the case, but does little actual detecting. Wolzien's writing style can be shaky at times; the viewpoint sometimes switches from Susan's to Jed's and Jed disappears for long stretches in the book. Unfortunately, the ending of the book is the old cliched one with Susan gathering the family together to reveal the identity of the murderer. But what makes this book worth reading is Wolzien's gift for creating real characters; you can picture each member of the Ericksen family as you're reading the book."An Old Faithful Murder" is a pleasant if unremarkable cozy mystery.

Since there was a Halloween Party going on at the library, when Susan Henshaw stumbled across a man with a knife sticking out of his chest, she thought it was a Halloween prop. But the man was murdered, and he's not the only victim, talk show host Jason Armstrong is also murdered. Jason's wife doesn't want to stay in the house where her husband was murdered, so Susan invites her to stay at the Henshaw house. Rebecca accepts and soon Susan's house is full of houseguests. Susan grows tired of her trying company and since she considers herself to be an amateur detective, she decides to investigate the case herself.I've recently discovered Valerie Wolzein's books and enjoy her Josie Pigeon series, but I found "All Hallow's Evil" to be a bit of a disappointment. One of Wolzein's strengths is her character development and while Susan is well written, as are some of the minor characters such as librarian Marion Marshall and next door neighbor Amy Ellsworth, other characters such as Susan's husband, Jed, and Rebecca Armstrong are bland and boring. What really ruins this book, however, is the editing. At one point, Susan makes a lunch date for 12:30, tells her husband, shows up for lunch and is upset that she has to wait until 12:30, and later her husband says he didn't know she had a lunch date. At another point, she drives Rebecca to the police station, then asks for a ride home, presumably leaving her car at the police station, yet her car is in the driveway the next day!Although there were many things I didn't like about this book, I have enjoyed the Josie Pigeon series and am willing to give the Susan Henshaw series another chance. Hopefully the other books have better editing.

Lately, private detective Paul Artisan has been handling routine cases such as insurance fraud and medical malpractice. Artisan is surprised when Clifford Widmore hires him to find his missing twin brother, Zander - Widmore is from a wealth family and can certainly afford to hire a big firm to find Zander. But Widmore insists that Paul is the perfect guy for the job - a big firm would bring publicity, which is the last thing the Widmore family wants. Paul has doubts that he can do the job, Zander could be anywhere in the world, but he accepts the challenge. Little does he know that in trying to find Zander, Paul will find himself.Although this book is connected to the TV show "Lost" (the "author" Gary Troup was a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815), you don't need to be a fan of the show to read "Bad Twin" nor do you need to read it for clues to the show if you are a fan but reluctant to buy this book. There's a few loose references to "Lost": the book is dedicated to Cindy who later was captured by the "Others"; the Hanso Foundation is mentioned; as is John Locke, the numbers, and Oceanic Airlines, but none of the mysteries on the TV show are solved."The Bad Twin" is an okay mystery. Much of the book is a clich&eacute; starting with Paul's friendship with the literary quoting professor Manny Weissman (although their sharing the elderly dog Argos is a cute touch). The wring is awkward; the author repeatedly refers to "the detective" rather than calling him Paul or Artisan. Much of the book is from Paul's viewpoint until the very end when it inexplicably changes to the viewpoint of another character. The plot does keep the reader turning pages but ultimately relies too much on coincidences: Paul just happens to be on the phone with someone as they are being murdered and later just happens to be in the right place to stop someone else from being murdered. And Paul must be quite a looker; virtually every woman in the book wants to have sex with him.Fans of "Lost" may enjoy reading this book for the few references to the show, but it's okay to skip reading it and watch reruns of the show instead.

Magdalena Yoder, the owner of the Penn-Dutch Inn is finally getting married. Not only is she busy planning her wedding, and dealing with her future husband's relatives who are staying at the Inn, but her future father-in-law gives her a barrel of sauerkraut as a wedding gift, which contains the remains of Aaron (the groom's) cousin who has been missing for 20 years. Magdalena doesn't want anything to spoil her wedding and tries to find the killer before the day of her wedding.As always, Myers fills the book with quirky characters, many of whom are suspects. Her books are laugh out loud funny, in fact, I'm still laughing over the last two pages!

Because of events in her past, Texas heiress Abby Rose has decided to become an adoption PI. Bride to be Megan Beadford hired Abby to find her biological mother because Megan wanted her at her wedding. Abby was not able to find Megan's mother in time for the wedding, but vows to continue to look until she finds Megan's biological mother. When Megan's adoptive father is murdered at the wedding reception, Megan wants Abby to find his killer. Abby agrees and soon finds out her two cases have a lot in common."A Wedding to Die For" is a good mystery by a talented author. Abby is a very human heroine, filled with anger about her past, yet very loving and caring. Author Leann Sweeney brings all the characters to life, even the minor ones, by giving all of them character traits that stick out, like Abby's boyfriend Jeff's habit of chewing Big Red chewing gum. One of my favorite characters in fact, is a minor one, Sister Nell - what a hoot she was! Sweeney has a way with words and I love her use of expressions such as "the man was so skinny he might need worming". The mystery itself was okay, although it was pretty obvious from the beginning who Megan's biological mother was. But the book is worth reading for the characters and Sweeney's way with words. Finally, this is the first mystery I've read that had me smiling at the end.Well done!

Wedding planner Annabelle Archer knew the wedding she was working on would be difficult, but she certainly wasn't expecting the mother of the bride to be murdered during the reception. The murder not only hurts Annabelle's reputation as a wedding planner, but her friend Richard Gerard, a caterer, is a major suspect. When there is a second murder which makes Richard even more of a suspect, Annabelle knows she has to work fast to clear his name. She has plenty of suspects but will she figure out who the killer is before she becomes the next victim?"Better Off Wed" is an uneven cozy mystery. The unevenness comes from the characters as some of them are well written and others barely register as characters. Annabelle is well done - good at her job and concerned about her friends. Caterer Richard is also well written and author Laura Durham deserves credit for having readers discover Richard is gay without stating the obvious. Too bad she doesn't do the same with Annabelle's assistant Kate and her habit of mangling familiar sayings - Durham points every single one of them out, which is too bad because it was one of the humorous aspects of the book. Outside of Annabelle, Richard, Kate, and Annabelle's elderly neighbor Leatrice, the rest of the characters aren't well written especially the murder victim's family. Because of this, the murder mystery aspects of the book aren't that interesting and it's hard for readers to try to figure out who the murderer is, which is part of the fun of reading cozy mysteries. And when the murderer finally is revealed, the motive for the murder is unbelievable."Better Off Wed" is just an okay debut cozy mystery novel.

Judy Bolton is bored. Her physician father and her mother are away on a much-needed vacation and she and older brother Horace are staying with their grandparents at the Smeed Farm. But she isn't bored long - she overhears a strange conversation, is kidnapped, meets some new friends and finds out that a nearby dam was built poorly and could break and destroy the town she lives in. Judy and friends try to warn people, but will they be too late?Originally published in 1932, "The Vanishing Shadow" is a nice, old-fashioned read. Author Margaret Sutton based several of the Judy Bolton books on historical events - this one was based on events in 1911 when a dam broke and flooded the town of Austin, Pennsylvania, killing nearly 100 people. The threat of the dam breaking is the major plot in this book. Judy is a strong heroine, headstrong (a bit too headstrong at times), an early feminist, likes to have fun (and doesn't mind being the center of attention) and keeps a promise (even if it means endangering people). While I liked Judy for the most part, I found her to be a bit unkind to her brother Horace. Horace is an odd note in the book, he was sick as a child and still weak, he is called "Sister" by all (including Judy) and even when he has his heroic moment he faints afterward. As for the mystery elements - it is clear from the beginning who the bad guys are (and they are some of nicest bad guys to appear in a book) and the real thrills in the book come from the events surrounding the dam.I grew up reading series like Trixie Belden, Nancy Drew, and Judy Bolton. While I'm thrilled that they are re-releasing the Judy Bolton books, I suspect the people that read the books will be adults like myself that loved these books when they were younger rather than today's children. The book is very old-fashioned - cars are a novelty in the book and most people either walk or ride a horse to get where they are going; when Judy is worried during an emergency she has no way of contacting family members (an oddity in today's cell phone world); and the characters say things like "Aw, Judy" and "I'll be darned"). All of this may be too old-fashioned for children in today's world."The Vanishing Shadow" is a charming, if old fashioned work of juvenile fiction.

The Sony ICF-C218 FM/AM Clock Radio is an alarm clock/radio that includes a jog lever to set the alarm time and a date button that displays the date, month, and year. It has an automatic time set (the clock displays the correct date and time when you plug it in) and an automatic Daylight Savings Time adjustment. It also has a battery backup in case of power outages.I was looking for a simple alarm clock radio that was inexpensive (hard to find these days) and I was thrilled to find the ICF-C218 FM/AM Clock Radio. There are a lot of things I like about this clock radio starting with the fact that I don't have to set the time when I plug it in or change the time during Daylight Savings Time (the clock is set for the Eastern time zone but can be adjusted for other time zones or areas that do not have Daylight Savings Time). The numbers are nice and large and I like the green color of the numbers - it is a nice soft color. It is very easy to set the alarm. The sound quality on the radio is okay - I find the AM stations sound a bit tinny - but this doesn't bother me as I bought this for an alarm clock not a radio to listen to all day.The Sony ICF-C218 FM/AM Clock Radio is an inexpensive alarm clock/radio that does a good job.

The dimensions of the 3M Adjustable Foot Rest are 14" x 22". The height adjusts from 4" to 4.75". The angle can be adjusted to + - 30 degrees.I find the foot rest to be easy to use and very helpful. It comes completely assembled which is a plus. I work in a cubicle and the foot rest just fits in the space under my desk - it is almost too large for the cubicle but I found that to be a plus since it prevents me from sitting too close to the computer and I'm no longer able to slouch over while typing. The height is very easy to adjust by turning the screws on the inside (be careful, however, as the edges of the foot rest are a bit sharp). It is also very easy to adjust the angle while you are sitting simply by putting pressure on the foot rest. Most importantly, I can feel the difference when I use the foot rest - my back and my legs immediately feel better and I'm not aching at the end of a long work day.The 3M Adjustable Foot Rest make a big difference in how I work and feel. Highly recommended.

Walking near her home while on vacation, Victoria Parsons meets Alexander van Schulyen. Alexander, a Dutch physician, is attracted to Victoria, even tracking her down to the hospital where she works as a nurse. Alexander starts dating Victoria and makes it clear that he cares about her, however Victoria is beautiful but insecure about her looks since she has three sisters who are even more attractive than she is and worries that Alexander will fall in love with someone more beautiful than she is. On top of that, Doctor Jeremy Blake, who is also attracted to Victoria, does everything he can to break up the romance, as does Nina de Ruiter who would like to marry Alexander. Will Alexander be able to convince Victoria that his love is real?Although I always enjoy reading Betty Neels, "Victory for Victoria" was not one of my favorites. Victoria comes across as being a bit vain and too much into her good looks. The romance between Victoria and Alexander is very believable, with a lot more kissing than Neels usually has in her books. The romance is so believable, in fact, that it's hard to understand why Victoria is so uncertain about Alexander's feelings for her. Having not one but two people trying to ruin the romance is a different and nice touch, although Jeremy Blake could have been more developed as a character and Nina is a bit too quick to explain her actions to Victoria."Victory for Victoria" is a nice romance, but not one of Betty Neels' best books.

Peggy Jean Turner, mayor of Cobb's Landing, a small New England town, is happy that mysterious banker, Max, has turned their once poor town into a colonial-themed tourist attraction, but is less than thrilled that he wants the town to reenact the first Thanksgiving for the tourists. Although she knows the town needs the money, PJ believes that Thanksgiving should be spent with friends and family. However, PJ is in the minority and she reluctantly agrees to take part in the reenactment. As she is preparing for the reenactment, she also has to deal with the obnoxious Prunella Post who is renting a neighbor's house for the winter. With crime on the rise, including someone breaking her shop window, Peggy is happy to welcome former police chief Stu McIntyre back to town and his old job. But when Prunella is found murdered and Stu's fiancee, Emily, is the chief suspect, Emily finds herself investigating the murder.I'm hooked on this charming cozy mystery series. What I like most about the series is the depiction of the friendship between PJ and her best friend and next door neighbor, Lavinia. Readers will enjoy their close and easy relationship and the friendship between their sons. PJ is a strong heroine, at times a bit headstrong, but very realistic as she struggles with running a town and business and life as a single parent. Her relationship with Ian is sweet, but feels a bit rushed. I wish Kate Borden had let the relationship build through a few more books before escalating the way it did in this book. The mystery was well plotted and I didn't guess the identity of the murderer until right before PJ did.The only problem I have with this series is that Borden's description of life in New England seems a bit off at times. I found it hard to believe not only that a town would not plow after receiving eight inches of snow but that the kids would still have school (nor would they have school when there's a foot of snow). Towns always go over budget on snow removal; it's a part of living in New England.Those issues aside, I've devoured the first three books in the series and look forward to reading the next one.

When my work gave out thePedometer Accusplit AE2720 Step, Set of 12for a Walktober event, it also gave out the Safety Leash for Pedometers to help hold the pedometer in place - a good thing because I've almost lost the pedometer more than once. The leash is easy to use - attach it to the pedometer at one end and hook the metal clip on your waistband or belt loop - I often attach mine to the top of my pants pocket. It helps hold the pedometer neatly in place and if the pedometer does fall off, the clip prevents it from falling all away off -the pedometer swings in space until you grab it. My one complaint is that the leash is not adjustable - it is a bit long and visible unless you clip it way to the side or wear a long the shirt/jacket. But that's a minor complaint for a product that works really well.

In this latest entry in the Sneaky Pie Brown mystery series, many of the residents of Crozet, Virginia are at a crossroads in life. Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen has quit her job as postmistress because her two cats - Mrs. Murphy and Pewter - and her dog, Tee Tucker, are no longer allowed there. As she tries to decide what to do next, Fair, her ex-husband, proposes for what he says will be the last time. Harry's best friend Susan, has problems of her own, including a secret she has kept buried for years; plus she is convinced that her husband, Ned, who has just been elected Senator, is cheating on her. "Boom Boom" who has always been a man killer, finds herself in a surprising relationship. While they are all dealing with these changes, Harry and Susan visit a monastery where they discover a statue of the Virgin Mary that appears to be crying tears of blood. When Susan's Uncle Thomas, a monk, is found dead kneeling at the foot of the statue, Harry suspects he was murdered. When a news reporter is brutally murdered, Harry suspects the two are related, but will she be able to catch the killer before she becomes the next victim?"Cat's Eyewitness" is one of the weaker entries in this cozy mystery series. At times I forgot I was reading a mystery, since the book seemed more about the characters' mid-life crisis rather than the mystery itself. Taking Harry out of the post office seems to have weakened the series, as she no longer interacts as much with many of the characters that helped make this series so interesting. The book focuses on the changes the characters are going through in their lives and while I found most of the changes plausible, Boom Boom's new relationship just didn't work for me. Rita Mae Brown has always used this series as a means of expressing her personal beliefs, but she went overboard in this book with her thinly disguised lectures on issues such as politics, war, and abuse in the Catholic Church.Devoted fans of this series will want to read "Cat's Eyewitness" but casual fans may want to skip it.

"Frozen in Time" is a well researched and well written look at the entire U.S. Skating team that was killed in a 1961 plane crash in Brussels. Author Nikki Nichols focuses mostly on the Owen family (nine time National Champion Maribel Vinson Owen and her daughters, "Little Maribel" and newly crowned National Champion, 16 year old Laurence) and Stephanie Westerfield, Laurence's closest rival and her sister Sharon. The book also gives insight into what skating was like at that time, with detailed explanations of elements such as school figures which are no longer included in competitions and the different competitions themselves, including the North American Championships which no longer exists. Finally, the book also talks about the devastating affect the deaths had on family members left behind as well as how the deaths forever changed the United States figure skating program.Although I was just a baby when it happened, I'm a long time figure skating fan and I grew up hearing about the plane crash and wondered what had happened. This long overdue remembrance is a poignant read and by the end readers will feel as if they knew each skater. Nikki Nichols intersperses the history of skating with her narration, including the fact that 1961 was the first time Nationals was shown on television (although on tape, not live). Nichols also compares skating then to skating now and skating fans probably won't be too surprised to learn that even back in 1961 Maribel Owen was fighting corrupt judges. The book is full of pictures and many of them are haunting, such as the team posing for pictures on the steps of the doomed plane; a burnt skate; the charred copy of Sports Illustrated with Laurence Owen on the cover; and the ever present smile of Laurence.If the book falters anywhere, it's when Nichols tries to imagine what the atmosphere on the doomed plane was. Of course, no one can know what conversations took place on the flight and Nichols valiant attempt doesn't work and tends to be over dramatic. I also wish the section dealing with the rebuilding of the U.S. Skating team had been a bit longer.Still, these minor flaws shouldn't keep anyone from reading this excellent book.

Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace are still adjusting to their new life after their parents' divorce. Not only do they have to adjust to a new school (Jared especially is having a hard time with this) but they are living in a house and area inhabited not only by humans but hobgoblins, trolls, fairies, and griffins. When Simon's cat disappears he goes looking for it and soon he also disappears. Jared and Mallory set off to help Simon, but they'll need some help in order to find him in time."The Seeing Stone" is the sequel toThe Field Guide (The Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 1)and is the second book in "The Spiderwick Chronicles" series and for the most part it is pretty good fun. Children will love the fantasy elements of the goblins, trolls, fairies, griffins, etc. especially the rhyming Thimbletack. The Seeing Stone (which helps them see the Goblins) is a nice addition to the series and authors Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black invent a funny if somewhat gross way for the children to see the goblins without the seeing stone. What kept me from entirely enjoying the book is that I felt some of the scarier moments were a bit too scary for young children. I found the goblins especially bothersome with their cages full of kidnap victims. And the hint of what might have happened to Simon's cat may be traumatic for younger children."The Seeing Stone" is a good fantasy but parents may want to read it first to make sure their children can handle it.

The Petrodex Cat Dental Care Kit was designed by a dentist and formulated especially for cats. It helps clean teeth and fight bad breath. The Kit comes with malt-flavored tooth paste to entice cats; a finger toothbrush (perfect for kittens); and a regular toothbrush. The toothpaste helps remove plaque and food debris and the toothbrush massages gums. The tooth brush and finger toothbrush are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.I have two young cats. One of them is already showing signs of gingivitis and I want to stop it before it gets too painful for her (and too expensive for me). I followed the instructions on the package and let her taste the toothpaste before even attempting to brush her teeth. She didn't like the smell of the toothpaste from the beginning and it is an epic chore to try and brush her teeth. I've tried both the finger toothbrush and regular toothbrush - I've had slightly better success with the regular toothbrush. Because of my struggles I've yet to see improvement in her gums, but I am determined to keep trying.The irony of all this is that while the cat who needs her teeth brushed fight me every single time I try to brush her teeth, my other cat - who doesn't have gingivitis - loves having her teeth brushed. She loves the taste of the tooth paste and would eat it right from the tube if we let her. She comes running over every time we to try to brush my other cat's teeth and sits there until we brush her teeth. If only she were the one with the gingivitis - we'd be all set!The Petrodex Cat Dental Care Kit isn't for all cats but some will love it!

After going through some difficult times, including being sent to live in an orphanage after the bizarre deaths of their parents, life seems to be getting better for Wally and Cheyenne Shluffmuffin. They're living with Professor Spydelle and his wife Shirley and they've even adjusted to the fact that Shirley is a giant spider. They're having a harder time accepting the fact that their father, who died in a porta potti accident, has returned and is now a zombie. Professor Spydelle thinks he has a potion that can bring their dad back to life, but instead turns him into a vampire (Spydelle should have known better since the last potion he used turned his human wife into a giant spider). Having a dad as a vampire causes all kinds of problems because as much as Wally and Cheyenne love their father, they don't want him drinking their blood. As if that wasn't bad enough, the Onts show up again, determined more than ever to take over the world, starting with Wally and Cheyenne. Wally and Cheyenne try to explain to the FBI that giant ants are threatening to invade, but things go disastrously wrong and Wally and Cheyenne are forced to face the Onts on their own.The Secrets of Dripping Fang series keeps getting funnier and funnier and book three "The Vampire's Curse" is extremely funny. The humor starts with a funny definition for zombies that you probably won't find in your encyclopedia and Professor Spydelle's eagerness to see a real zombie and continues from there. There's a humorous trip to a music store that also happens to sell viruses, a funny trip to the hospital when dad really needs some fresh blood and an equally funny trip to the FBI. There is humor to be found everywhere in the book, including the illustrations and chapter titles (chapter 3's title is especially funny). Other funny moments include dreams that Wally and Cheyenne have and a phone call from the Jolly Days Orphanage in which Hortense Jolly offers orphans at a discount price (the more you buy, the cheaper they are). Although the book is clearly meant for a young crowd, there are some nice bits of humor aimed at adults, including a quote from Dickens. Adults should be warned that there are some parts of the book that may be a bit scary for children. While the vampire and zombie parts are played for humor, the FBI's visit to the Onts may be too scary for younger children."The Vampire's Curse" is great fun.

Emma Hastings is on vacation in Holland with her mother when she hits a car driven by Dutch Surgeon Justin Teylingen. Not exactly a good start to a relationship and she is not thrilled to learn that he will be performing surgery at the hospital where she works as a nurse. Emma thinks Justin is in love with his cousin, little does she realize that he is in love with her and is willing to wait until she falls in love with him.This is another wonderful romance from Betty Neels. The plot is one of her most popular - a handsome and rich Dutch doctor falls in love with a plain English nurse who is excellent at her job and comes from a poor but loving family. She also throws in the plot device of having the heroine in danger and the doctor must save her (showing the reader he loves her although the heroine isn't aware of it yet). There is nothing new here, but that's what is so great about her books - you know exactly what you are getting when you read them and they are a great pick me up when you need it."Wish With the Candles" is another winner from Betty Neels.

Abby Knight is thrilled that her cousin Jillian is getting married. Sure, she's not thrilled that her bridesmaid's dress makes her look like a clown, but Jillian has hired her to do the flowers for the wedding and Abby, owners of the Bloomers Flower Shop, can use the money. Abby's even willing to look after Jillian's grandmother-in-law during the wedding. Life is never dull with Abby around as a fistfight breaks out during the wedding. But the real trouble starts when Grandma wanders off and Abby finds her near a dead body. Abby's not one to shy away from investigating a murder and is especially anxious to solve this case, as one of the suspects is the boyfriend of Grace, her shop assistant."Dearly Depotted" is a delightful entry in this charming cozy mystery series. Abby is a plucky heroine, not afraid to get involved in a mystery; outspoken, often without thinking ahead of the consequences; bright, yet confused about her relationship with hunky ex-cop Marco. The book is also filled with Abby's delightful sidekicks: shop assistant's Little and Grace (I chuckled when Kate Collins described Grace meeting Elvis when he was in the army); Abby's roommate Nikki and her playful cat Simon; her client Trudee DeWitt; and her incredibly selfish cousin Jillian. Besides the mystery, there are several subplots going on that help make the characters seem real. The mystery itself was well written and plotted and I had no idea who the murderer was until the very end.Well done.

As both a jigsaw puzzle fan and a fan of the TV show "Lost", I couldn't resist buying "The Hatch" jigsaw puzzle. It turned out to be one of the most difficult jigsaw puzzles I've ever worked on. For starters, I didn't realize that the picture on the box did not match the puzzle itself, which made it much more difficult. The puzzle is divided into several sections, separated by black and white borders, so there are dozens of black and white pieces that could go anywhere. Some of the sections are pretty easy for fans of the show to figure out, while others were so difficult that I didn't know what part of the show it referenced until I put the very last piece in. The puzzle does reference several different episodes of the show and fans will enjoy reliving those episodes through the puzzle.As for the secrets "revealed" in the puzzle, there may be some secrets in the puzzle itself, but it seems that you have to buy all four puzzles in the series (the other three are called "The Others"; "The Numbers" and "Before the Crash" - this one has not yet been released) to fully reveal the secrets. So you would have to put together all four puzzles, keep them assembled and then turn them over since there is secret is on the reverse side (it's glow in the dark). With each puzzle being approximately 19" x 26", I'm not sure how many people have that kind of room for all four assembled puzzles.People who like a challenging jigsaw puzzle and have plenty of time to solve it will enjoy "The Hatch" jigsaw puzzle.

"Walk Away the Pounds Express" features two walking exercise programs: a one-mile "Easy Walk" and a two-mile "Brisk Walk". Both walks are led by Leslie Sansone and she has a group of walkers with her. Each walk incorporates the Stretchie Band (although you can do the exercises without the band)."Easy Walk"The "Easy Walk" is a very quick (approximately 18 minutes) but very effective exercise routine. It features all of Leslie's regular moves: the four basic steps (walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts) as well as kick backs (hamstring curls). You exercise at a pace of nine minutes for each half-mile. The Stretchie Band adds just the right bit of intensity to make this a challenging walk when you are short on time. You start using the Stretchie Band about 13 minutes in and you use it for about three minutes - it sort of serves as the cool down period. You use the Stretchie Band twice both in front of you and around your waist. Finally, there is a nice stretch sequence at the end (about two minutes)."Brisk Walk"The "Brisk Walk" is a two-mile walk that takes about 32 minutes from start to finish - each mile is about 15 minutes long. Again, Leslie uses her four basic steps and kick backs, but adds some upper body moves (reach your hands over your head and pull them down again) and some movement - (walk forward and back while doing knee lifts) and balance and coordination (put one hand out while kicking with the opposite leg) that aren't included in the one mile walk. While this is a nice invigorating workout, Leslie does not incorporate some of the vigorous routines she does in other two-mile walks. For example, she only does single side steps no double side steps and only single knee lifts rather than double or even four knee lifts at a time. The Stretchie Band does add a nice bit of intensity to the workout. You use it about 21 minutes in and use it for about six minutes (with some breaks in between). Again you use it twice in front of you and twice around your waist. It is a nice segment and I could definitely feel the results afterwards."Walk Away the Pounds Express" is a nice workout DVD by Leslie Sansone and the Stretchie Band adds a nice boost to both the one-mile and two-mile walks.

First shown on PBS, "The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits" is a fun look back at the 1970's TV Show. It consists of several clips from the show as well as interviews with cast members Skip Hinnant, Jim Boyd, Rita Moreno and Judy Graubart as well as contributors to the show Joan Rivers and Tom Lehrer. There is also an interview with Joan Ganz Cooney who helped create the show. The special features include deleted interviews with the cast members and an audio review with Tom Lehrer.For the most part, "The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits" is an enjoyable documentary. At the time it debuted in October 1971 it was a groundbreaking show with a fully integrated cast teaching children how to read using comedy and music. It's always fun to watch a show as an adult that you loved as a kid and catch some of the references you missed back then. Easy Reader was of course based on Easy Rider but it was interesting to hear Skip Hinnant say that he stole largely from "Get Smart" when doing Fargo North, Decoder; Jim Boyd saying J. Arthur Crank was based on Ralph Cramden; and Rita Moreno saying "Hey you guys" came from Abbott and Costello. There are plenty of clips from the show including animated ones such as "The Adventures of Letterman" and several based on Tom Lehrer's delightful songs including "Silent E" and "-ly". The live action skits include "I'm in love with a giant" and "The Super is eating his supper" which is fun to watch just to see the cast trying to keep a straight face as water pours down on them.Since this is a documentary and not full episodes of "The Electric Company" adults will probably enjoy this DVD more than children. It does have quite a bit of praise for Morgan Freeman, currently the most famous of the then unknown actors, but it stops just short of going overboard on the praise. While it was nice to see Hinnant, Boyd, and Graubart, I hope other actors from the show such as Luis Avalos, Hattie Winston, and Lee Chamberlain show up in interviews on future DVDs. For some reason the show focuses solely on the adult members of the cast, with no mention at all of the Short Circus and the child actors, a bit surprising since Irene Cara was a member of the Short Circus for awhile."The Electric Company's Greatest Bits and Hits" is good nostalgic fun.

As I write this, my Roomba is working away, vacuuming my living room. It's amazingly easy to use, you just charge it until it's ready, set up virtual walls if needed (it comes with two although I usually only need one), turn it on, and let it go to work. The Roomba picks up an incredible amount of dirt, I'm a pretty neat person but I have a cat who keeps the Roomba busy picking up her fur. I love the fact that the Roomba goes under my bed, which is one of my cat's favorite places to sleep. The Roomba needs to be emptied out and cleaned between each use, but it's fairly simple to clean it.While I love my Roomba, there are a few things I don't like. Before using the Roomba, you have to make sure there are no power cords or wires dangling that the Roomba can get tangled up in. This isn't really a problem, but I've yet to figure out a way to Roomba proof my computer room with all the equipment and power cords in that room. The Roomba takes a long time to vacuum a room, often as long as two hours. And once it's finished vacuuming (nicely redocking itself when it's done) it has to recharge for three hours before it can be used again. This means that it can take all day to Roomba my house. Still, it's not like I'm pushing a vacuum all day, so I really can't complain.The Roomba isn't cheap, but to me it's worth every penny I spent. I love it!
