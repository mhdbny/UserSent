Oasis emerged out of the woodwork in a sudden moment in mid-1994 to become one of the most remarkable rock bands in recent memory.It was this album, Definitely Maybe, that started Oasis-mania; or in graver terms, the new britpop invasion of the world.Definitely Maybe is definitely a classic. Noel Gallagher, the band's lead guitarist and songwriter, gives out one classic song after another. Whether it's the cool rock phenomena of Supersonic and Live Forever, the best composition Noel has written over the past 10 years. Fan favorites Columbia, Rock 'N Roll Star, Shakermaker, and Slide Away all have equal power to blow you away. The roof raising Up In The Sky is yet another example of Noel's writing genius. The low key but very blunt and funny Married With Children is the album closer leaving the listener with a nice tune to bid farewell to this rock epic before pressing the play button again!Liam Gallagher, Noel's younger brother who also happens to be the band's vocalist frontman, is probably one of the best rock vocalists of the past twenty years. His voice shines on tracks like Slide Away, Live Forever, and Married With Children.Today, Oasis are still a force to be reckoned with in the british charts, but elsewhere, their magnifying glory has either washed away or stumbled a bit. There's always Definitely Maybe and the follow up What's The Story Morning Glory to remind people that these guys aren't just some one hit wonders. They are in fact, in the Gallaghers' words, "the best band in the world"RecommendedA

Oasis had come a short distance but crossed boundaries and were the kings of britrock that had crossed over and ruled America over the course of the summer of '96. The band packed their bags, trashed the tour and returned home and went straight into the recording studios to make the album they were dreaming about. Their very own White Album.Be Here Now is an example of a band that had pushed the envelope. A band that sits on top of the world and taking itself way to seriously. But why wouldn't they? Oasis have released two major number one hit albums back to back one year apart with 'Definitely Maybe' in 94, and 'What's The Story Morning Glory' in 95. Now it's 97, and Oasis had all the right to take advantage of their name, the equipment they had, and come out with one loud rocking bang!Be Here Now opens up with Do You Know What I Mean which is the strangest sounding rock song ever released since The Beatles released Revolver. A cool song that marks Oasis' first experiment with the avant garde-ish sound that the other fab group before them ventured into. My Big Mouth is a loud hair raising rock tune. Liam's best vocals in years. One of the best tracks on Be Here Now. Magic Pie is Noel's first vocal duty on the album. A solid accoustic song that elevates into a hard rocker with Noel singing his heart out. Stand By Me is Oasis at their best. A low key rocking ballad that will make you want to fall in love. It's songs like these that really give Oasis their unique voice. I Hope I Think I Know is a punk rock song where the music is much better than ythe lyrics. Girl In A Dirty Shirt is Noel's bluesy ode to his then girlfriend Meg Mathews. Fade In/Out is the loudest song on the album. That scream in the middle comes as a surprise. Johnny Depp plays slide guitar on this song that sounds like a theme from a western movie at the very beginning. One of the album's highlights. Don't Go Away is what Oasis can do best. A Wonderwall-ish rock ballad. The most beautiful tune on the entire album. This song can easily fit on Morning Glory. A rock classic. The Title track Be Here Now, which doesn't make sense at all, moves on by at flight speed but not hurting the album. Intended to be the Morning Glory of the album, and even though it fails it's still a not too bad song. All Around The World is where Oasis really push it. At 9 minutes, this has got to be the longest song I have ever went through. One of the album's highlights. A grand epic about peace on earth. More like a cry for help on the band's part. It's Getting Better Man sounds like it was recorded live. And that only makes it sound better man! The reprise at the end sounds unnecessary but for a White Album that had to be put in there.On a Oasis level, this is their most overproduced, and over hyped album they ever released.But it grows on you like a fungus. The only reason that Oasis are still rocking big in the UK today is because they really know how to make good music and know how to cheer people up. Be Here Now will cheer you up. If it doesn't then you can do what Liam tells you to do in the title track ' flash your pan at the song that I'm singing' Whatever way you choose, thsi is a great album, not the greatest, but compared with the rest of the albums in the market, the greatest.

16 years after Tim Burton stunned audiences and critics with his believable and dark motion picture version of Batman, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) has remade the movie with an even more believable premise and darker edge.After Burton and Batman star Michael Keaton left the Batman series in 1992 with Batman Returns, the sequels got worse and ridiculous (Joel Schumacher literally destroyed the Batman installments with Batman Forever, with Val Kilmer as Batman, and Batman And Robin, with George Clooney turning Batman into a smiling dummy). Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.As the title prescribes, the film explores Bruce Wayne's gradual emergence into the dark caped superhero, and in the process resurrects the death of his rich and famous parents. The film then shows Bruce getting picked up and raised by the family's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), departing from Gotham to no man's land where he learns the skills of fighting on the hands of ninja warrior Ducard, played by Liam Neeson (Gangs Of New York), being initiated into but refusing to join a dark cult known as the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), returning to a corrupt and crime-ridden Gotham city, reestablishing a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, played by Katie Holmes, and vowing to bring back order to the city that his father help build, and in return got him killed, while in the process fight a relentless enemy known as The Scarecrow, played brilliantly by Cilian Murphy (Red Eye), with a little help from an honest detective named Jim Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace, JFK).Nolan's directing never fails, while Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is only second best to, if not equal to, Michael Keaton's. Whether you agree with me or not, Batman Begins is destined to be a new beginning for yet another adventurous and exciting Batman franchise, just as long as Joel Schumacher stays away!RecommendedA

Office Space is a hilarious comedy directed by Mike Judge, the man who brought us Beavis and Butthead (he provided the voices for both characters as well), and starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston and featuring Mike Judge as an irritating restaurant manager.The reason why many people have liked this film is because it touches upon an issue that is very common amongst people: hating work!Peter Gibbons, played by Livingston, is our hero who is hassled by more than one manager about some memo that he says he recieved but forgot to implement, and hates the fact that his manager always picks on him to come in on Saturdays to finish some leftover work. One day, Gibbons goes to a shrink who hypnotizes him into a complete state of relaxation right before he, the shrink, has a heart attack. Peter becomes carefree. He goes to work when he feels like it wearing jeans and sandals. He even decides to stop going to work, stop paying his bills, and gets the courage to speak out calmly like everything is cool.What happens next is up to you to find out.If you seriously are being hassled at work by your employers, annoyed by everybody and everything from your obnoxious co-workers to that stupid printer that always jams, I really recommend you watch Office Space.A

Magical Mystery Tour was a significant moment in the Beatles' history simply because it marked the biggest flop for the fab four. Don't get me wrong there, it was the movie inspired by the album that flopped, not the album itself.The songs on Magical Mystery Tour are typical Beatle greatness. The first Beatles single of 1967, which has been revered as their best single ever, released before the epical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is featured here: Lennon's raw and elusive Strawberry Fields Forever and McCartney's sweet Penny Lane. The title track, penned by McCartney, is similar to its predecessor's title track Sgt Pepper in that it is a carnival of sound with the band welcoming you, only this time on a wonderful trip. The high point on the album has to be Lennon's landmark tune I Am The Walrus (he would later reveal that the walrus was Paul in The White Album's track Glass Onion), his other contributions are nothing less than spectacular: the quirky Baby You're A Rich Man, and the anthemic All You Need Is Love, a song that defined a generation of peace-seeking hippies. McCartney, on the other hand, takes over most of the production like he did on Sgt Pepper: the reflective The Fool On The Hill, the song that was probably a hit before your mother was born Your Mother Should Know (I love the sound of that song!), and the extravagant Hello Goodbye. Harrison offers Blue Jay Way, another one of his experimental songs, that by then had become his signature sound.Despite the failure of the movie inspired by the album, Magical Mystery Tour is yet another classic album from the best band that had ever walked the earth.RecommendedA-

It was November 22, 1963, the day US president John F. Kennedy was assassinated marking one of the most overwhelmingly saddening and pivotal events in American history. A man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was caught the very same day and charged with the murder of the president. The next day, Oswald was assassinated by former FBI agent Jack Ruby as he was leaving the facility he was being held in. The investigation has since frozen, and it was Oswald's name that has been linked to that of the president as the lone gunman who killed him.Less than 30 years later, controversial American filmmaker Oliver Stone reopened the JFK assassination files with this excellent movie that studies the assassination, and comes up with theories revolving around Oswald, and a plot to kill Kennedy that involved the CIA, FBI, Cuban exiles, Lyndon B. Johnson and many others. Now remember, it's all a matter of theory. But the theories presented in JFK are eye opening. How could Oswald shoot no less than 5 bullets in a mtter of 8 seconds and get the president from at least 3 different angles? (The magic bullet theory). What about the people who said that they heard shots coming from the picket fence right in front of the motorcade as it was passing by?JFK is an interesting movie with a star studded cast including Kevin Costner as District Attorney Jim Garrison, who takes us along on an inspiring investigation spree of who did what, and for what reasons, Sissy Spacek as his impatient wife, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw Bertrand, the man Garrison is trying to pin, Gary Oldman who does a brilliant job as Oswald, and many others including Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donald Sutherland, and Michael Rooker.One of the best movies ever made!RecommendedA+

The Farrelly brothers, who gave us Dumb And Dumber, Kingpin, and Me Myself And Irene, direct There's Something About Mary, a movie that stars Ben Stiller (Meet The Parents), Cameron Diaz (The Mask, Gangs Of New York), Matt Dillon (The Outsiders, Crash), Chris Elliot (Groundhog Day, Scary Movie 2), and many others.Mary is a story about a Rhode Island loser named Ted, played by Stiller, who can't keep his high school dreamgirl Mary, played by the charming Diaz, out of his mind 13 years after their prom date went terribly wrong way before it happened. He hires an obnoxious guy named Patrick, played by Dillon, to spy on her and tell him what she's been up to. Well, Patrick falls for Mary, and decides to move out to Florida where she resides to get to know her, and he does. Ted discovers that Patrick isn't giving him the truth about Mary and goes out to find her himself. It turns out that Mary has many admirers who try to win her heart (or shoes!) besides the lonely Ted. So the movie becomes a race on who can get her first and forever.It's a silly tale but under the Farrellys direction, it's a surefire laugh-fest all the way through. Expect to see lots of sick humor like a guy giving a dog CPR, or bodily fluids used as toiletries. Also, the characters in Mary are funny by nature. The funniest character of them all is Warren, Mary's handicapped and heavy set brother, who punches people who touch his ears and loves to give piggy back rides.RecommendedB-

Stop the Clocks deserves the respect of hardcore fans and past fans of Oasis. The band has been making music for the past 12 years, haven't lost their touch, haven't sold out to make pop or rap, and, after 12 years, still revolve around the once-known-to-be fueding brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, the voice and soul behind one of the most exciting and unpredictable bands in recent memory.Clocks delivers a retrospective of Oasis's bumpy career thus far. To no surprise, most of the songs, which were all compiled by the Gallaghers themselves as songs that, according to them, encapsulate their band's best contributions to modern rock over the past decade, are from their first two albums: Rock 'n Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, and Slide Away from the 1994 breakthrough debut Definitely Maybe; Some Might Say, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova from the 1995 mega hit follow-up What's The Story Morning Glory. Other classic hits include the UK number 1 hit Go Let It Out from 2000's dud Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, the Liam penned ballad Songbird from 2002's subtle Heathen Chemistry, and the UK number 1 hits Lyla and Importance of Being Idle from 2005's solid Don't Believe The Truth. The boys even manage to thrown in 4 great b-sides, which sound better than most of the singles they've released to date: the brilliantly written acoustic ballad Talk Tonight, the sentimental The Masterplan, the arena rocker Acqueisce, and the stunning Half The World Away.The only flaw I find on the compilation is the title: Stop The Clocks is a song Noel has been writing, rewriting, recording and re-recording over the past 5 years; someway, somehow, it would have been nice to have this song included on the compilation instead of causing some sort of confusion, and even misleading some music-goers to the content of the album, but that's Noel Gallagher for you!Besides that, both the collection of classics and the band still rock on!RecommendedA

It had been 6 years since Oasis ruled the music scene in Britain and the rest of Europe, and it had been 3 years since Oasis confirmed their conquest of America when Be Here Now debuted into the Billboard charts at number 2.But now it's...a new decade for the boys from Manchester and a new Millennium for the rest of the world, and Oasis put out the most daring album yet.With two founding members gone, and two new members replacing old glory, Oasis were on the way to a new making. The music still sounds the same except for some.F**king In The Bushes can easily be looked upon as one of their most exciting musical jams ever. When i first heard it i couldn't believe that it was Oasis. No singing on this one except for some old lady commenting on how wonderful the Isle Of Wight was. This is way better than the Swamp Song from Morning Glory. Go Let It Out! is a new swing for Oasis. Though not as powerful as previous songs like Live Forever and Morning Glory, the song delivers a hand raising anthemic chorus. Who Feels Love can sound mesmerizing if you are in the right mood. It has indian sitar, psychedelic mixes of backward guitar loops, and so forth. The message of the song, however, sounds more like Jim Morrison gibberish. Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is is a not worth the money really. This is an album filler. Sounds better as a b-side. Little James is Liam's first composition. It is genuine. I love this song. It's so innocent, so touching, so delicate, so not Liam!!! Gas Panic is by far the best track on the entire album. It is the first time i hear Oasis do something dark. A very impressing experience. Where Did It All Go Wrong? is Noel delivering one of his best lead vocals to date. Noel's songwriting reaches it's mature peak on this song. Sunday Morning Call, however, takes that maturity a little too far. Not that it's a bad song, but it's not really the best Oasis can come out with either. I Can See A Liar is the least impressing track on the album. Out of place completely. This one would have sounded better as a b-side also. The album comes to a close with the mellow, Champagne Supernova type song Roll It Over which compared to it's predessor album closers doesn't amount to much. But you can't ignore that touching chorus line and Liam's sensatonal voice pondering with every word.The brilliance of Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is that it is a band on a transitional stage from one era to another. This was the beginning of a new beginning of Oasis. ...Oasis have become more underground here in America than commercial. But if i want to compare any track on this album with the garbage that America is listening to nowadays, the album is pure gold all the way. That comes to show that the leftover[s]... that Oasis throw behind outweighs any Linkin Park or Smash Mouth or Blink 182 or Kid Rock, that's for sure. That's why i give this album 4 stars.

Oasis have come a long way.Since 1994, the two Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, along with three other members who have been replaced over the past 5 years have gone through instant rise to stardom, a quick blow to a tour that could have cemented their star status in America, inner fueding, at least one lousy album, broken marriages, and children. Despite all this mess, Oasis have never failed of delivering pure rock n roll music in the form of delightfully catchy and tuneful songs.Don't Believe The Truth is the band's 6th studio recorded album. Let me just open up by saying it's way better than Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, their 2000 album that over time has become my, hands down, least favorite Oasis outing. Whether the album re-establishes Oasis as a major player in mainstream rock in America or not, Don't Believe The Truth is a satisfying Oasis release.Noel Gallagher, Oasis' typical songwriter, takes passenger seat this time around with the other members taking turns at the wheel. Liam sparks with three above average songs, the first of which is Love Like A Bomb, a Lennon-esque rocker ballad, a quite amazing tune with simple lyrics just like Songbird from 2002's Heathen Chemistry. Guess God Thinks I'm Able is another delicate accoustic Beatles-esque tune with lines like "No one can break us, no one can take us", a subliminal and blunt message from Liam to brother Noel that their partnership is undisputed. Finally, Liam lets it all hang on The Meaning Of Soul, a song Noel describes as "Elvis on Red Bull". Whatever, the point is, Soul is an average fast tune that qualifies Liam as an able songwriter. The opening track Turn Up The Sun, a cool ballad written by former Ride guitarist bassist Andy Bell, a member who replaced Paul McGuigan in 1999, is a powerful rocker with a message about loving one another. Gem Archer, rhythm guitarist and replacement of Bonehead since 1999, offers A Bell Will Ring, a feel good rock number that, unfortunately, is at best only filler. Noel's creativity shines on Part Of The Queue, a mellow rock number with a northern feel, a song about life in the city, reminiscing Noel's past b-side contributions from the 90's. Another track worth a brag is the first single Lyla, another Noel song that after repeated listening will become quite catchy. Although very ambitious, Lyla lacks the fever that past songs like Roll With It had. The Importance Of Being Idle, a highly appreciated Noel number, is deliberately filled with some cool surfer rock style guitar hooks. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino borrows a sample from Idle in one of his future films. The highlight of the album, and one of my personal favorites, comes last on the album. Let There Be Love, written by Noel, features the first time both Noel and Liam share lead vocal duty since Acqueisce, a delightful song and I just love the way Noel enters the song with "Come on baby blue". Priceless!Track picks:LylaLove Like A BombGuess God Thinks I'm AbleTurn Up The SunLet There Be LoveRecommendedB+

Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) joins Academy Award winning actor Adrian Brody, Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts, and comedian Jack Black in the heart winning remake of the classic tale of King Kong.The movie pursues an eccentric 1930's film maker, Black, who takes off on an ocean voyage after getting scolded by his producers following a bad test screening to find the mysterious Skull Island where it was said is home to a monstrous creature. All that the director wants is to capture scenes from this island to put in his next movie to make millions. Accompanying him is an aspiring actress named Ann, played brilliantly by Watts, his writer, played by Brody, and the rest of the movie and ship crew.Cutting to the chase, King Kong, an enormous ape, is discovered on the Island occupied by grizzly natives who sacrifice Ann to him. What occurs between Ann and the ape is a heartwarming relationship. Ann discovers that the monstrous animal is not that monstrous, but playful, courageous and loyal. The scenes where Kong rescues Ann from the raging dinosaurs, including a few T-rexes, are reminiscent to Jurassic Park, but amazing action sequences that end with quite a laugh.The story evolves into a striking love story, not a romance, between the ape and Ann that end up in an incredibly rebuilt 1930's New York City, where Kong causes awe and havoc in the city, but all for the search of his lovely Ann where he sees a beauty that kills the beast within him.It's a lovely tale, and you will feel pleased to watch it despite many criticisms revolving around differences between the original and this new version.King Kong will make you laugh, cry, and sit at the edge of your seat. Definitely one of the best movie experiences of the year!RecommendedA-

Jersey girl is a sweet and funny movie directed by Kevin Smith (Clerks), and starring Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (both previously appeared together in Armageddon), comedian George Carlin, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.The story is about a New York music executive named Ollie Trinke who loses his wife, played by Jennifer Lopez, while she is giving birth to their first child, a girl he names Gertrude after her deceased mother.Under stress and frustration due to his current situation and lack of fatherly experiences, Ollie also loses his job after he trashes his biggest client, "Fresh Prince" Will Smith, in front of reporters. He moves in with his father, played by Carlin, in Jersey as a result.7 years later, Ollie is still unemployed and struggling as a single parent to 7 year old Gertie, played by Raquel Castro. He meets Maya, a video store clerk played by Tyler, and they both hit it off. Ollie is also trying to a find a way back into show business.The story's dillemma is whether or not Ollie should get a job and lose the fruitful relationship he has going with his daughter, or sacrifice that to being a full time father.Despite being corny and seemingly a cliche movie, and Ben Affleck's bad acting, Jersey Girl is delightful! I honestly found myself enjoying the film even though I don't usually do that with stories that offer nothing new or actors I dislike.Watch out for cameo appearances by Jason Lee, Matt Damon, and the fresh prince himself, Will Smith.RecommendedB-

The Beatles' break up in 1970 was headline news all over the world. The boys had been working nonstop for 8 years straight, producing number one albums one after another and maintaining the title of the most important band in the world. However, the abrupt breakup left an album worth of songs unfinished in Apple studios. Producer Phil Spector took the job to complete what was to become the Beatles' final album Let It Be, released in the spring that year.Let It Be is unique in that it is, after all, the last album by The Beatles. You sense a lack of chemistry especially between Paul and John on the first track I Got A Feeling, where Paul is singing the chorus and John enters with "everybody had a hard year..." which sounds like a completely different song altogether. However, the Beatles succeed in revisiting their sound from the early 60's in One After 909, a song that can fit well on A Hard Day's Night, while Paul and John seem to put away their differences and settle down on Two Of Us, an incredible duet between the two most famous songwriting partners in history. Individually, three of the Beatles offer their traditional dosage of tunes. Lennon offers Across The Universe, which has become one of his greatest contributions to the Beatles catalogue. Harrison rocks it out good on I Me Mine. McCartney, on the other hand, gives the album the theme song Let It Be, which became a soundtrack song of the generation, The Long And Winding Road, and the awesome rocker Get Back.With Let It Be, the world lost their most gifted rock band forever (the murder of Lennon in 1980 drew the curtain on the possibility of the fab four ever getting back together), and the soundtrack of an entire generation came to a close.RecommendedA

Okay, it's official, Million Dollar Baby is one of the best films of the year 2004. I watched this movie last night with high expectations; I was not disappointed. Like Clint Eastwood's previous melodrama, Mystic River, this film deals with some real emotions of average people you and I encounter everyday. Is it a great boxing film? Well, it is in a way. But unlike other great boxing films like, say, Rocky or Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby doesn't focus on the rise and/or fall of a striving boxer for a shot at the title. The movie touches more on the feelings of the boxer, the manager, and everybody around them. Hilary Swank (The Next Karate Kid, Boys Don't Cry) is stunning in her role as a struggling waitress striving to become a prize fighter, Maggie. Like Rocky Balboa, she is a down-on-her-luck average nobody who is determined to make a name for herself even if it takes spending hours in the gym punching the bags in spite of the ridicule of the other club fighters and the rejection of the club owner, an oldtimer named Frankie who refuses to train a girl and cares more about protecting his fighters than giving them a title match, and the sympathy and encouragement of Eddie, played remarkably by Morgan Freeman, a former contender who never got the chance at the title for losing his eye after a long damaging fight, who cleans the toilets, wipes spit, and literally lives in the gym.Behind the sweat and the guts of each of our main characters are ordinary problems for average people. Eastwood's Frankie has lost his number one contender, Big Willie, to a big-shot businessman who gives him the title match and the heavyweight championship, something Frankie would have delayed for another 2 or so fights, and also he has lost touch with his daughter who he tries and fails to send letters to, only to get the letters sent back under "Return to sender". Maggie's constant struggle in life is topped with her dissatisfied, ungrateful, and uncaring trailer-dwelling mother. Eddie, who narrates the events in the film, has to deal with a pride-swallowing job and coping with the loss of a boxing career and never surpassing his 109th winning fight.What happens next? Frankie begins training Maggie after seeing the determination that she has. He leads her through a successful fighting spree where she keeps on winning, and in the meantime building a very close and loving relationship with his once, neglected 'girlie' fighter.The movie might seem close to Rocky in many ways, but nearly half way through the movie, the story takes a 180 degree turn in a totally different direction that enhances the characters' deep feelings and struggles with loss, guilt and neglect.Million Dollar Baby is a powerful drama brilliantly directed by Clint Eastwood and featuring powerful performances by Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman (both having a big chance of winning this year's Oscars for Best Actress and Supporting Actor respectively), and Clint Eastwood.Very recommendedA

Home Alone is a brilliant comedy produced by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire), and starring child sensation Macaulay Culkin (Uncle Buck), Joe Pesci (Goodfellas), Daniel Stern (City Slickers), John Heard (187), and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice).Home Alone is not only the highest grossing comedy of all time, (the movie has made more than 500 million dollars worldwide to date), but it is also the film that made Macaulay Culkin, who was only about 9 years old at the time of the film's release, a household name and an international mega star overnight.Home Alone is about a child named Kevin McCallister, one of the many children of the upper-middle class and very eccentric Chicago suburbanites McCallisters, played by Heard and O'Hara, who accidentally is left behind by his huge family when they rush to the airport on their way to spend the winter break in France, so Kevin finds himself alone at home, hence the title. In the meantime, two scheming and rather stupid burglars: Harry, played by Pesci, and Marvin, played by Stern, are going house to house in Kevin's neighborhood stealing everything they can. They set their eyes on the McCallister home because as Harry describes, it is the silver platter. However, Harry and Marvin are in for a surprise and lots of pain as Kevin is smarter than they think.Home Alone is flat-out hilarious. John Hughes, the man behind such 80's comedy classics as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and Uncle Buck, continues his string of Chicago based movies with Home Alone. There are several signature Hughes elements in the film: in addition to the Chicago theme, there is the scene where Kevin talks to himself in the bathroom mirror, right before he puts aftershave and screams (the movie's most copied signature scene). This is a reference to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris, played by Matthew Broderick, breaks the 'fourth wall' and speaks directly the viewers.Almost 16 years after its release, Home Alone is still one of the most popular family comedies ever made.RecommendedA

Malcolm Little, a.k.a. Red, was not a man I would have wanted to be seen hanging around with. I wouldn't even have wanted to cross paths with him. But what happened to him later on in his life and the change that he underwent is one of the most influential and inspiring true stories that have ever touched my heart. When Malcolm accepted Islam, even though he entered this great religion from a wrong and very misleading angle, it was the beginning of a legendary figure's emergence into the American conscience and a beacon for all that stood up to the oppression and injustice that America was doing to its own people. This legendary person's name was Malcolm X, or Hajj Malek Shabbaz, may God bless him.Spike Lee, the director of Do The Right Thing, brings Malcolm X to the big screen with Denzel Washington portraying the late Black leader. The movie takes you through Malcolm's turbulent childhood, his upbringing into a young con man, drug abuser, and gang leader. It was his 6 or so years spent in jail where Malcolm was introduced to the rising Nation of Islam lead by Elijah Muhammed from one of his inmates. Malcolm educated himself in jail and turned out to be what many never expected; an outspoken, strong and very intelligent spokesperson for the Nation and the struggles of the black community across America. The movie successfully reveals the inner conflicts between Malcolm and the Nation, and the result of Malcolm breaking away to become an independant activist. The film also does Malcolm's story justice by showing his pilgrimage to Mecca - pilgrimage is known as Hajj in Arabic and is considered the fifth and final pillar of Islam. It was this special visit to Mecca where Malcolm was exposed to mainstream Islam - the true picture of Islam unlike the misleading teachings of Elijah Muhammed and the Nation of Islam. The movie ends with the disturbing assassination of Malcolm and a piece narrated by Ossie Davis featuring pictures of the real Malcolm X and a scene with Nelson Mandela giving his thoughts on Malcolm.The movie is based on the bestselling book 'Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Malcolm X himself as told to Alex Haley.I do recommend reading this book to get a wider picture of Malcolm's life and realization of mainstream Islam.One of the best movies I have seen.A

Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star-studded cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Benecio Del Toro (Traffic), Jessica Alba (Honey), Mickey Rourke (Get Carter), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks), Clive Owen (Closer), and Elijah Wood (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy). The movie also features cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) and many others. The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.Sin City comes straight from the comic by Frank Miller, who also takes the helm as co-director. It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.Sin City is a comic book come true!RecommendedA

The Beatles stunned critics, took their millions of fans by surprise, and literally outdid themselves when, in 1967, they presented the Grammy Award winning Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a rock album of epic proportions, after nearly a year on break (Revolver was their last album in 1966 before returning with Pepper).38 years later - yes, that's right...it's been that long, Sgt Pepper's is still revered as the first real concept album. According to many people today, it was this album that would inspire other major rock bands' work like Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and, later on, The Wall, The Who's Tommy, and pretty much most, if not all, of Led Zeppelin's work (no pun intended).Sgt Pepper contains some of The Beatles's most powerful work, something that might please Paul McCartney since he wrote most of the material himself. The opening title track is literally a curtain raiser, with the band welcoming us to the show. The song fades right into With A Little Help From My Friends, a remarkable tune sung wonderfully by Ringo. The 'rock opera' of Sgt Pepper ends there (or does it?), just in time for John Lennon's mesmerizing, and quite controversial, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds followed by a string of strong McCartney tunes: Getting Better, Fixing A Hole, and She's Leaving Home. Lennon returns with the extravagant Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite, followed by Harrison's Within You Without You, a song that inspired the boys to take a 'spiritual' journey to India to visit the maharishi, something George would later take seriously while the others shrugged off. Paul comes back after that with the witty When I'm Sixty Four and Lovely Rita before John makes the final and lasting appearance on the album with, first, the experimental Good Morning Good Morning and, after the Sgt Pepper show closing Reprise, the mindblowing A Day In The Life, the highlight album closing song that stirred heads, and remains to be one of Lennon's greatest contributions to the Beatle catalogue.RecommendedA+

Saw was a horror film with a good storyline and an excellent twist at the end. Saw II, however, doesn't come close to the original.The sequel introduces a new character Eric Matthews, played by former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg, a cop with a grudge who has just had a falling out with his son. Jigsaw attacks once again and this time it's Matthew's son who's in the torture chamber with a group of convicts that Matthews put away.Unlike the original, the script for Saw II seems like it wasn't revised enough. The characters aren't given much background study even though Jigsaw is finally introduced as an old man dying of cancer, but the torture scenes, especially the one at the beginning of the film, are horrific.Fans of the original and horror films in general might find Saw II quite entertaining. But the film's staleness and silly character buildup makes the original much more entertaining.Mildly recommendedC

Def Leppard's 1987 classic Hysteria sounds terrific 20 years after its release. With the help of the album's straight-out 80's rock vibes, sweet lyrics, catchy tunes, harmonious choruses, and solid grade-A rock ballads, Hysteria is commended as one of the greatest albums ever made. The album features Leppard's finest work: the monumentally popular Pour Some Sugar On Me, the hair-raising Rocket, the heartbreaking Love Bites, the spine-tingling Hysteria, the elusive Animal, and the awesome Women.The album will leave you with the impression that 80's hair bands weren't so dreadful after all, and Def Leppard are to be taken nothing less than seriously!RecommendedA

Four Brothers is the latest film by director John Singleton who back in the early 90's made Boyz N The Hood to a mass of critical and audience acclaim.Singleton's newest feature stars singers turned actors: the already veterenated actor Mark Wahlberg, Outkast's Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and the up and coming actor Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers who return to their old neighborhood and home in Detroit after their foster mother is shot to death at a local convenient store to seek revenge.The movie attempts to mix light humor in its dialogue while turning the knob up on the anger, melancholy and frustration the boys endure as they are out to get the guys who killed their beloved gaurdian. There are the usual twists and turns along the way but the revenge remains very straightforward, Singleton style.There are no over the top performances by any of our main characters including the supporting cast that features Terrence Howard, who just recently shined in the Singleton produced Hustle And Flow, and Josh Charles, but the movie makes its point by succeeding in grabbing your attention even through the usual revenge/action-movie cliches that it's filled with.RecommendedB-

East Seventeen. Or East 17. Or E17. When I think of East 17, I also think of Take That. These two rival boy bands were the hippest thing in Britain and the entire world from the border east of that country and over between 1992 and 1995. It's been 7 years since. And let me tell you, their music still sounds cool! You might call it a guilty pleasure now, I would call it some really cool memories.The songs on here are all of East 17's singles throughout their very short career. Dance tunes 'House Of Love', 'Steam', 'Let It Rain', 'It's Alright', the soulful tunes 'Hold My Body Tight', 'If You Ever', 'Slow It Down', and the ballads 'Stay Another Day', 'Someone To Love' and 'Hey Child'. This pretty much sums up one big part of what the early 90's generation considered to be the coolest music around.Enjoyed it then? Enjoy it again!East 17 are no more. But this collection of songs is timeless.Recommended

Denzel Washington has played many brilliant characters in the past, most notably Malcolm X and The Hurricane, Rubin Carter. Unlike those real life characters, Alonzo Harris has no ties with reality, thank God. This character is a cop who has been in the streets for too long dealing with scum that eventually his mind and morale went crooked. Trust me, we do not want these kind of characters wandering our streets! Denzel nails the part with extreme professionalism which earned him an Academy award for Best Actor.Ethan Hawke, who plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt, is excited and yet very unlucky to be assigned to Harris for a his first day, training day. What Hoyt is about to experience is a day that he will be looking back at not as a day of his training to be a cop, but as a day he chose the moral path he would stick to for the rest of his life.Antoine Fuqua's direction brings the realism of the streets and smoothens the atmosphere for his characters to express themselves freely, especially Washington who seems to steal every scene he's in with the dialogue that he conveys like a pro and its Ethan Hawke who does a wonderful job of staying one step behind Washington making the characters interactions one on one an interesting viewing.The DVD features several bonuses including a behind the scenes segment, an alternate ending and a couple music videos.RecommendedA-

David Fincher, the director behind Se7en and Fight Club, makes an extravagant suspenseful thriller with The Game. The noir-ish theme from Se7en remains, but this isn't a story about a crime being uncovered; only The Game is about a crime in the making (or is it?)Michael Douglas plays a successful rich businessman (an echo image of Gordon Gekko from Wall Street) who's haunted by his father's suicide. His life is typical; no adventures, just the same old, same old everyday. Things change when he recieves an unusual gift from his younger brother, played charmfully by Sean Penn. Nothing else should be said after this for I do not wish to ruin the plot if you haven't already seen it. But just to give you a glimpse, Michael Douglas' life turns very bumpy, dark, mysterious; in other words, it turns completely upside down in one of the worst nightmarish mind-boggling roller coaster trips any rich successful businessman stuck in a routine and haunted by his past could ever have!Very Recommended!A-

The most popular superhero makes his way onto the screen with this extraordinary motion picture directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) and featuring a star studded cast including Academy Award winners Marlon Brando (The Godfather) and Gene Hackman (The Unforgiven, The French Connection), Christopher Reeve (Deathtrap), Ned Beatty (The Toy), Valerie Perrin (Lenny), and many others.Superman is one of the most exciting superhero flicks ever, and one of the best movies ever made!You all know the story already: young Superman, Kal-el, the son of Jor-el, played remarkably by Brando, is sent to earth by his father right before his planet Krypton bursts into smithereens. He lands in a small town called Smallville, picked up by the Kent family, and raised as their own child that they name Clark. Clark grows up with unexplainable super powers, like scoring touchdowns all the time, kicking a football across the state, and racing trains and winning. Clark discovers a piece of kryptonite in the barn of his earthly parents' farm that tells him to head north, where he, or the toss of the kryptonite, builds his new home Krypton on earth where he meets the image and voice of his father who expains to him that he is not one of the humans. Years later, he's wearing tight blue pants, a red cape, and shirt that has the sign S on it. You know the rest of it so I'll stop right here.Superman was a major motion picture event when it was released back in 1978. It still is today despite the more advanced special effects in movies today. Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luther, Superman's nemesis who plans to destroy the world and take over, while Reeve, in his first major starring role, shines as Superman, a role he would find hard later on to escape the shadow of, and pass away nearly 26 years later and be remembered for nothing more than that.The film is electrifying, entertaining, engaging, and absolute fun for the entire family.RecommendedA

Martin Scorsese is one of the best film directors today. Robert Deniro has teamed up with Scorsese in over 5 movies: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, and more. Scorsese's films are primarily realistic, meaning that the stories that he works on are reflections of some real social issues. Take Taxi Driver, where Travis Bickle played by Robert Deniro, an average american nobody, takes up guns and an assassination plot to kill a local political figure to attract some sort of attention to his miserable and useless self, only to later channel all his anger in making a positive action by ridding the community from a disgusting lowlife pimp and his croonies.In The King Of Comedy, Scorsese offers us another slice of american realism. This time Travis Bickle...er, I mean Rupert Pupkin played again by Deniro, is our central character. Pupkin is another average american nobody who is so self-centered, too obnoxious, and worst of all, he thinks too much of himself. He wants to become the new king of comedy, a phenomenal comedian who will take america by storm. Pupkin begins harrassing Jerry Langford, a famous TV talk show host, played by Jerry Lewis, who is more like Johnny Carson or in today's terms, David Letterman. All that Rupert wants is a chance to be in a short stand up on Jerry's show, and all that Jerry wants is Rupert off his back. Unlike Taxi Driver's Bickle, Pupkin doesn't resort to violence, instead he kidnaps Jerry and demands to be on the live show. The results are hilarious.The King of Comedy is a realistic but very quirky film with Robert Deniro delivering one of his most outstanding and underrated performances in his career.The movie also stars Sandra Bernhard as Rupert's equally twisted and Jerry-crazed sister.RecommendedA

Macaulay Culkin rose to fame as Kevin McCallister in 1990's blockbuster comedy Home Alone.2 years later, and with an 8 million dollar salary, the highest amount ever offered to a child actor, Culkin returned to the big screen after the mild success of 1991's My Girl in a sequel to his starmaking hit.Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is another hilarious movie produced and written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire). Returning for the sequel are Joe Pesci (Goodfellas) and Daniel Stern (City Slickers) as dumb burglars Harry and Marvin, John Heard (187) and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice) as Kevin's parents, the McCallisters, and the entire McCallister family. On board this time around is a hilarious cast including Tim Curry (Oscar), and Rob Schneider (Demolition Man).Exactly a year has passed since the fateful winter, and the McCallister family again rush to the airport, this time to catch a flight to Florida. Kevin lags behind and accidentally takes the flight to New York, hence the title. It turns out that the 'wet bandits' Harry and Marvin have escaped from prison from Illinois and made to the city that never sleeps. The two theives set a plan to rob a local toy store called Duncan's Toy Chest that Kevin find interest in because the store's manager donates all of the money he gets on the holiday to the children's hospital. In the meantime, Kevin tours the city and checks himself into New York's finest hotel, The Plaza, where the Hotel Concierge, played by Curry, and the bellboy, played by Schneider, become suspicious of the young boy who's dad they never see. Anyways, the burglars bump into Kevin again and are in for yet another failed heist due to Kevin's wit and all the goodies and traps that he has set up for their painful pleasure!The movie is funny, but it has a similar plot to the original. I'm sure many people who watched the movie in 1992 felt they were watching Home Alone again, which explains why the sequel made less money at the box office than the original.Keep an eye out for former brat-packer Ally Sheedy, who worked with John Hughes in the 1985 classic The Breakfast Club, as a New York ticket agent.RecommendedB+

Wall Street is a marvelous movie directed by Oliver Stone (JFK) and starring Michael Douglas (The War Of The Roses) in his only Oscar winning performance, Charlie Sheen (Scary Movie 3), Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill), and Martin Sheen (Catch Me If You Can).Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, is an ambitious stockbroker who wants to make the big time as a highroller. Gordon Gekko, played by Douglas, is Bud's idol and dream client. After a brief meeting with Gekko and an offer of buying the airline that his father, played by Martin Sheen, works for, Gekko takes young Bud under his wing, exposing him to the lifestyle of the rich and merciless and initiating him into the corrupt world of Wall Street.Nearly 20 years after its release, Wall Street remains to be a powerful film. What makes the movie so interesting is Douglas's convincing performance as a man who's got it all and has lost all sense of morality.RecommendedA

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors living today. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, and his most recent The Aviator are modern day classics.The Color Of Money is also on the list of Scorsese's movie portfolio, and it's also one of the best movies made in general. The film stars Paul Newman (The Hustler) and Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire, Rain Man) as hustlers out to make big cash in the pool halls. Newman reprises his role as Fast Eddie Felson, from 1961's film The Hustler, an oldtimer who is looking for new talent to sport around, Tom Cruise plays his target Vincent, a talented pool player and potential hustler. Felson teaches Vincent and his girl sidekick Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) everything there is to know about professional hustling and then out they go across country hustling through every state they pass on their way to the big championship in Atlanta. The highlight of the film is in the tense relationship between the desperate Felson, the crazy jealous Vincent and the manipulative Carmen, and how they manage to work as a team.RecommendedA

The Lost Boys is a cool teen horror flick directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever) and starring the Coreys, Haim and Feldman (License To Drive), Keifer Sutherland (Young Guns), Dianne Weist (Bullets Over Broadway), and Jason Patric (Sleepers).Weist plays a single mother who arrives with her two boys, Michael and Sam, played by Patric and Haim, to California to start a new life. Immediately upon arrival, Michael is initiated by a group of young vampires to become one of them on the account of his admiration of one of the girls in their cult, played by Jami Gertz. Sutherland plays the leader of the vampires, David, who is as creepy as the best of them. Sam discovers his brother is turning into a vampire after getting tips on how to identify a vampire from the Frog brothers, played hilariously by Feldman and Jamison Newlander, who work as vampire killers, and he struggles to fight the bloodsuckers who are targetting his whole family.The movie is funny, dark, slick, and scary. It's also one of the more famous movies that paired the Coreys, and one of their best.RecommendedB

Buffalo, New York band Goo Goo Dolls scored big with 1998's platinum selling album Dizzy Up The Girl. After all, the album featured their biggest selling Number 1 hit single to date Iris, a song made famous for its inclusion in the best selling soundtrack for the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan fiasco City Of Angels (the sountrack also featured songs by U2, Eric Clapton, and Alanis Morissette to name a few).Iris is not the only big hit on Dizzy. The album includes some of the best songs for the New England trio: the elusive hit singles Black Balloon, Broadway, and the hard rocking Slide, the Def Leppard inspired album opener Dizzy, the mellow Acoustic # 3, and the sharp Bullet Proof.Dizzy Up The Girl is the most successful album the Goo Goo Dolls have released so far. It is also one of the biggest rock albums of the past 10 years.RecommendedB+

A History Of Violence is a new thriller directed by David Cronenberg (Naked Lunch) and starring Viggo Mortensen (The Lord Of The Rings trilogy), Maria Bello (The Cooler), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), and William Hurt (Syriana).Violence is a tale of a seemingly ordinary family living in a small town in Indiana. Tom Stall, played by Mortensen, the head of the household, owns a diner, and tries to keep his family out of trouble, at one point chastising his son Jack, played by newcomer Ashton Holmes, for beating up his bully. One night out of the blue, Tom and his workers at the diner are encountered with two vicious killers who intend to hold up the place and kill everyone inside, Tom reacts and ends up killing both men in cold blood. The town instantly revere Tom as a local hero. His 15 minutes of fame costs him his privacy and security when a mob led by Carl Fogarty, played by Harris, begin stalking Tom and his family assuming that he is a notorious ex-mobster from Philadelphia that he insists he isn't.The movie is engaging and will keep you wondering what will happen next. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. With dynamic performances by the entire cast, a surprise cameo by William Hurt as a mob boss, an excellent screenplay, and a short running time, A History Of Violence is what a movie should be.One of the best movies of 2005!RecommendedA-

Martin Scorsese has followed 2002's Gangs Of New York by recasting Leonardo DiCaprio in the biography picture of movie director and founder of TWA, Howard Hughes, in The Aviator.I honestly was not looking forward to seeing this movie. But last night, there was no other movie worthy of a brag so I gave it a try. The result was a very impressive 2 hour and 30 minute film that didn't bore me once.Dicaprio has proven himself, at least a little, as a capable actor. He plays the eccentric, daring, bold, detail-oriented and paranoid Howard Hughes. The movie takes you through his years as a movie director and how he spent more than three years shooting, reshooting and reshooting again the first big budget movie in history, Hell's Angels. The film also reveals his eccentric life with Katherine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett, and later with Ava Gardner played by Kate Beckinsale, his obsession with airplanes and how in fact he would end up modeling planes for the american army, his daredevil tactics in test flying planes, one of which led to a near death accident, his engaging confrontations with the senator of Maine, played by MASH star Alan Alda, over accusations of war profiteering, and the attempt by PAN AM headman Juan Trippe played by Alec Baldwin to shut down TWA to avoid international flight competition, but unable to convince the crazy and determined Hughes to sell.What the movie, or Scorsese, tries to do is emphasize Hughes' crazy personality, which it does successfully. From watching The Aviator I now know that Hughes was quite unusual. He was mean, full of green (money), and tough on hygiene!Hughes saw his vision of aviation as the way of the future. This movie is a true and successful vision of Howard Hughes' way.A

What amazes me about Matchbox Twenty is that they didn't fall short, compared with other bands like Counting Crowes, after winning awards for their debut album. Matchbox kept on going, striking out one hit after another and making themselves shown as a serious musical talent. Of course, none of this would have actually happened without Rob Thomas' singing and songwriting gift. He was the big winner along with Carlos Santana at the Grammies 2000 for the song 'Smooth', just several months before Thomas was to relaunch his status as a frontman to the band with a highly anticipated follow up to the first album, Yourself Or Someone Like You. Mad Season, true to its title, came out and it proved that Matchbox Twenty was a band that was going to be around for a much longer time than many people expected, including myself.The album includes hard rocker Angry; soft rockers The Burn, Bent, Rest Stop; and ballads If You're Gone, Bed Of Lies, Leave. A collection of songs that are diverse in sound and share the common touch of Rob Thomas' outstanding lyricism. The highlights have to be If You're Gone, which is rich in its music and its touching lyrics and overall sound; the title track Mad Season; Rest Stop, a true story narrated (or sung) by Rob; The Burn, a song that will grow on you slowly; and, of course, Bent, a powerful hit single.RecommendedA-

The 1980's were all about Michael Jackson. He was the biggest musical artist of the decade, and everything that he was involved in sold in millions.His second album released in the 80's, third in all counting 1979's Off The Wall, Bad was a huge hit. Following the biggest selling album of all time, 1982's Thriller, the 11 track album included some of Michael's most challenging and inspirational classics: the funky title track Bad, the soulful ballad The Way You Make Me Feel, the slick Smooth Criminal, the peace anthem Man In The Mirror, the rocking Dirty Diana, the strange but awesome Speed Demon, the media-bashing Leave Me Alone (the first in the never-ending string of such songs), and the amazing Liberian Girl.Bad marked Michael's first and only album to score an astonishing five consecutive Number 1 hit songs in the US: I Just Can't Stop Lovin' You, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man In The Mirror, and Dirty Diana. The album sold more than 30 million copies worldwide making it the second biggest selling album after Thriller.It's no surprise that Michael was on top of the music world nearly 20 years ago. He wrote the best songs, sold the most albums, and attracted more listeners than Eminem does today. Bad features Michael at a point in his career, which has been in a downfall since 1993, when he was extremely confident and had the entertainment world in his back pocket.Who's bad?RecommendedA-

The quiet Beatle, as he was always known, George Harrison's solo career is highlighted in this worthy compilation of his best work during the Dark Horse years, 1976 through 1989.In my opinion, George's best solo work occured during this period. Just listen to the breathtaking Blow Away and Life Itself for extra proof. Other stand out tracks include the anti-establishment, anti-corporate brilliance of Cockamamie Business, an underrated song that even John Lennon couldn't write, a song that bashes fast food restaurants, record companies, and the movie industry. Then there's the sultry Poor Little Girl, the amazing Number One hit cover Got My Mind Set On You, the ode to the Beatles days When We Was Fab, the elusive All Those Years Ago, and the rocking Cheer Down, which was featured on the soundtrack to the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover blockbuster Lethal Weapon 2.Other tracks like Crackerbox Palace, Here Comes The Moon, and Gone Troppo show Harrison at his least creative stage in his career. But overall, the album's consistency is a nice treat for Harrison, Beatles, and classic rock lovers alike.RecommendedB

Glengarry Glen Ross is a superb drama directed by James Foley (At Close Range), and starring a powerful all-male cast including Al Pacino (Heat), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator), and Jonathon Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl).The movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by David Mamet, who also helms the screenplay to the movie version. The thing that drew me most to Glengarry Glen Ross was the dialogue. And since I tried my hand at door-to-door sales, I felt very connected to the characters in the movie, especially Sheldon Levene, played remarkably by Lemmon. The presentation made by Alec Baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist.The movie is not just for salesmen (even though I find it mandatory for anybody who's considering a career in sales), but for everybody who appreciates real movies.RecommendedA

Fifth album released, including that one "Swing While You're Winning", and Robbie is still the world's most fabulous pleaser.The kid's come a long way since his boy band days in Take That back in the 90's. It's been ten years since Take That took over the British charts. A decade has passed...who would have ever thought that Robbie out of all the members would be ruling the charts singlehandedly?Escapology is a remarkable elevation for the entertainer. A little bit of R'n B, Rock, and those signature Robbie songs and you have yourself a new type of Robbie. A much more musically focused artist.The saga begins with 'How Peculiar'. A rock anthem in the steps of past songs 'South Of The Border', and 'Let Love Be Your Energy', short and easy to digest. Then comes 'Feel' which is by far one of Robbie's finest songs. A dramatic boost for Robbie in the direction of artistic excellence. Elton John, George Michael and Sting come to mind after hearing this. This is the most intimate Robbie song ever caught on tape. The song will move you like no other. And it's no wonder that it was chosen as the first single from the album. 'Something Beautiful' is bubblegum pop extraordinary at its best. Highly influenced by the anthemic blues of Billy Joel and the performance of Tom Jones. This is the first new ground that Robbie covers on Escapalogy. 'Monsoon' is a hard rocking track. Expect this to be a live favorite. 'Sexed Up' is the Angels of Escapalogy. I said before in a review of "Sing When You're Winning" that it's songs like these that give juice to Robbie's albums. Well 'Sexed Up' is more than just the juice, it is the fruit itself. A beautiful tune. In fact, the highlight of the entire album. With an open message to former love Nicole Appleton, Robbie declares that it was he who broke up with her and not vice versa. Whatever the song is based on, it is a universal message for all those who can't seem to stick to one partner. 'Love Somebody' follows suit. A good song where the music is much better than the lyrics. 'Revolution' covers the second new ground for Robbie. This time in the rhythm and blues direction. On this one he duets with an unknown, Rose Stone, and what you get is an impressing sweet tune. 'Handsome Man' is a charmer. A rock anthem in the same theme of past tunes 'Let Me Entertain You' and 'Old Before I Die'. What you can't ignore about this song is Robbie's ego surpassing the norm with lyrics like 'I put the brits...in celebrity' The Ego Has Landed? Actually, it has taken off! 'Come Undone' is where he lands once again. A gentle tune where Robbie proclaims 'I am scum....but I'm your son...I come undone' Britain, are you listening? Next Robbie takes on the freshest new ground that he never covered but only wishes to. America. 'Me And My Monkey' is a spoof on modern day pop culture where the stars are...monkeys? A western theme flows throughout the song that steals the title of the famous John Lennon penned Beatles song 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey' and the storyline of the Paul McCartney penned 'Rocky Raccoon' both from The White Album. The song is weird. Funny weird explains it best. But Robbie sure does a good American accent. One of the albums highlights and at over 7 minutes, the longest track Robbie has ever done. 'Song 3' is a hard rocking jab at Blur's 'Song 2'. Not as good as the Blur hit but worthwhile. The following track on the list is 'Hot Fudge'. This song's got "potential future hit single" written all over it. Robbie covers the ground he's trying hard to capture again. In the same theme of John Lennon's "New York City", here he praises Los Angeles in every verse and line of the chorus refering several time that 'there's a green card in the way'. Robbie planning to make the same move that the previously mentioned did to America? 'Cursed' is a low key rocker with a disco orchestration in the background. Whether he is or is not refering to Spice Girl Geri Haliwell in the song, it doesn't matter. Skip! The album ends with Robbie's first ever solo composition titled 'Nan's Song' An ode to his deceased grandmother. A sweet acoustic tune ending the album on a good note that Robbie is a much more talented artist than most people think.Escapology is a staggering effort put together by Robbie Williams and his mate since the very beginning, Guy Chambers. No doubt about it, this pair is one big hit making machine.As for Robbie individually, he's grown and is growing into a dynamic entertainer. Escapology is a step up from his previous album 'Sing When You're Winning'. It's not necessarily reinvention because Robbie needs no reinventing. Straight and simple, he knows how to make good music.Escapology is an instant classic!Highly Recommended

Let me just open up my review by saying that I had no intention to see this movie tonight, but I did because the group I was with wanted to watch it.With that said, I was expecting to watch some ridiculous Hollywood summer movie type of trash. If Zorro does score as trash, I'm not surprised. It's the same old cheesy cliches repeated one scene after the other.The reason I give it a 3 instead of a 0 is because I enjoyed the majority of it. Antonio Banderas succeeded in making me laugh in several scenes. The action scenes also were worth the money. Catherine Zeta Jones has honestly lost her aura that she had nearly 8 years ago, and she just struttles from one scene to the next. The one actor that does steal the show to a certain extent is the Zorro's son, especially in the scene where he kicks his teacher's ass!I'm not a big fan of action/adventure films, but Zorro is delightful in a way that it mixes the action with much humor. In other words, this movie is not for the intellectual viewer. So just mark a Z on intellect and enjoy it while you can.Not for everybodyC+

Although most of the stars of this classic teen comedy flick are now long gone or just aren't as sparkly as they were when this mvoie was released, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still the best comedy movie of the dreadful 80's. Jeffrey Jones's Ed Rooney character is the highlight as the school dean who gets his ... kicked, ripped and bitten by everything and everybody except the one person whose driving him nuts, Mathew Broderick's Ferris Bueller. Alan Ruck's Cameron Frye is the legendary character that each person relates to, absolutely hilarious in the most "depressing" way...and i do mean that in a good funny sense. Mia Sara's Sloane Peterson is the sweetie pie that not only Ferris wanted to marry, Edie Mcclurg as the dean's secretary will make you crack more laughs than the number of pencils in her hair...and let's not forget Jennifer Grey's Jeanie Bueller, the jealous bitchy sister who falls in love with a drugged out loser played by Charlie Sheen in the funniest cameo appearance ever.This is one of my favorite comedies of all time...despite the features which only include director John Hughes shot by shot commentary, the DVD quality of this classic is worth the while.Now don't tell me that you can't hear Wayne Newton's "Danka Shane" and the Beatles' "Twist and Shout" playing in your head!own it now!

Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, The Aviator) returns with The Departed, a gangster thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic), Jack Nicholsen (The Shining), Matt Damon (Ocean's 11), Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights), Martin Sheen (Catch Me if You Can), and a whole lot of cellular phones!The story is about two undercover spies, one working for gangster Costello, played by Nicholsen, in the police department (Damon), and one working for the police chief, played by Sheen, in Costello's band of low-lives (DiCaprio). What you get is a one helluva twister of a movie. The plot, as simple as it may be, crawls all over you like a snake in the sand pinching you every now and then, making you wonder in amazement "What the heck just happened?" In the midst of all that, there's a love traingle that evolves between a police therapist and both Damon and DiCaprio.For a movie that is being hyped up as Scorsese's return to basics, it's not what you'd expect. The movie is fun, but not colossal like Scorsese's classics Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, and his previous film, The Aviator.RecommendedB-

Beverly Hills Cop is an action comedy, and possibly the best in its genre. The movie stars Eddie Murphy (48 Hours), Judge Reinhold (Fast Times At Ridgemont High) and Ronny Cox (Deliverance), and is directed by Martin Brest who would later direct Al Pacino in his only Oscar winning performance in 1992's Scent Of A Woman.Beverly Hills Cop is about a Detroit cop, Axel Foley, played by the foul and loud mouth Eddie Murphy, who's surprise visiting friend gets killed right outside his apartment door, and he sets out to Beverly Hills on vacation but secretly out to investigate the killing of his buddy which leads him to the discovery of a gang boss dealing with coffee and drugs. If you want to see Murphy in his funniest moments onscreen, then this is the movie. Cop is where Eddie's famous open mouthed laugh originated, as well as such classic scenes came from, Murphy dangling out of a speeding truck, getting thrown out a window, and pretending to be an inspection agent. But it's really the friendship he makes with the Beverly Hills cops assigned to watch him, the uptight Taggart (John Ashton) and the lightfooted Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), and the funny one-liners that make Beverly Hills Cop one of the funniest movies ever made, and a definite classic."I don't smoke Lucky Strikes man, I smoke King-Sized Kents!"RecommendedA

I saw this movie when it was first released back in September, and something gave me the feeling that this was the year that the critics and hollywood were going to blow up Jamie Foxx out of proportion. Well, they did and now Foxx has won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a musical/comedy for his performance as the late musician Ray Charles.First of all, if you are not a fan of Charles or simply do not know who he is or was, then I presume that this film is not for you. The movie was made for Ray's fans in particular and those who appreciated his music. In modern terms for the younger generation, Ray is a long version of a Behind The Music episode on VH1, but instead of interviews, we get dramatic re-enactments of the events surrounding Charles' life from his younger years, how he became blind, rose to fame, and destroyed himself with a heroin addiction. The film successfully details these events, and does it with an eager enthusiasm. The major drive behind of the movie, however, and the true highlight of the entire story is the music. Remember, this is a movie about Ray Charles, the man who sang such classics as You Don't Know Me, Hit The Road Jack, Georgia On My Mind, and Unchain My Heart; all these songs appear in the movie.Finally, there's the acting. To be honest, I didn't get the whole Jamie Foxx buzz (he was in Held Up for crying out loud, one of the worst films ever made). It will take Foxx the next couple of films to really prove himself, which in my opinion he won't be able to due to the fact that he really isn't the best thing I have seen on the big screen in a long time. I mean he doesn't come close to Denzel Wasington or Will Smith (who's been making some really dumb movies recently) I can't deny, however, that Foxx does an excellent impression of Ray Charles, but I don't think impressions are worthy of any best acting awards, unless of course if the actor added his own into it. If Foxx is getting all this praise, then I guess Jim Carrey should have won about 3 Oscars already, and Dave Coulier should make a comeback very soon!Average***1/2 out of *****C+

Coldplay's first album Parachutes sparked raving reviews and good feedback from audiences around the world (including this particular one right here!)Their second outing is no different and in fact it takes Coldplay's stardom to another level."A Rush Of Blood..." is as the title states a rush of some really cool drifting soulful mellow and effective tunes that will flow straight to the head.In My Place by itself sends shivers and a sweet sense of joy every time you'll hear it and sing along to those beautiful verses and chorus.Politik is a straight out low key rocker with that ever so delicate sound of Coldplay.If you thought that was not enough, then comes the outstanding Clocks, God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, The Scientist and Warning Sign that will mesmerize you just as much as Sparks, Spies and Yellow did on Parachutes.What seems exciting to me about A Rush Of Blood To The Head is that even though it is a follow up to a successful debut album, it sounds as though it is the debut album. The band have not relyed on any new sounds or any heavier or more expensive equipment while recording this album (it's obvious from comparisons between this one and the first). Coldplay can indeed record each album with the same melodies that they recorded before and it will still sound amazing. Not that the songs on A Rush... sound like the ones on Parachutes but it sounds as if they were all written and performed during the same time when Coldplay were possibly unknowns and trying to make a break. Well, a break they did make and this album is a delight to the ears.After years of prolific British talent rising, most notably Oasis, Radiohead, Travis and The Verve, Coldplay are the new breed, the new generation of British Rock talent that will score big in the charts around the world. The album's lengthy stay in the top ten on the Billboard charts could be an indication of just that, that they are here to stay, at least for now and hopefully for a longer time. I wish them luck and more beautiful albums with those sweet and not too flashy songs. To put it in a nutshell, A Rush is not your Morning Glory but it ain't your Be Here Now, it's not Urban Hymns and it's not The Man Who nor The Bends. It has an identity of its own just as much as Parachutes did. That ID was Coldplay, and they are just as celebrated as any of those bands.And as the opening song Politik says "open your eyes..." Maybe it is time to open your eyes to a new Brit rock invasion of Coldplay, maybe they intended it to be more than a lyric. A statement.Final Rate: 10/10A+

Wow, what a classic!I've probably watched Super Fuzz so many times when I was younger, it's become like what Gone With The Wind is to many people.This brilliant laugh-out-loud comedy stars Terrence Hill as David Speed, a police officer who, after being exposed to ultra-red rays, gains super powers that allow him to move objects, like trucks, with his eyes, fall out high buildings without getting hurt, and make huge balloons from blowing bubble gum. The only kicker is that everytime he sees the color red, he loses his powers temporarily.The movie co-stars Academy Award winning actor Ernest Borgnine (Marty) as David's uptight Sergeant Dunlop.Super Fuzz is a highly enjoyable comedy that everybody will love.RecommendedA-

Little Man is a new collaboration of the Wayans brothers: director Keenan Ivory, and comedian actors Marlon and Shawn.Unlike their past films Don't Be A Menace, Scary Movie, and White Chicks, Little Man has little funny substance to offer.The movie does have its funny moments, but nothing extraordinary that'll split your sides, or crack you up.Marlon Wayans plays the little man, a convict who upon his release from jail, goes on a new heist, steals a diamond the size of a golf ball, comes close to getting caught again, slips the rock into the purse of Shawn Wayan's girl, follows them to their house, pretends to be an abandoned baby at their doorstep...and the rest of the film revolves around a one-joke plot: baby fondles and gropes the women, baby can get out of his crib at night to make phone calls, baby can beat the heck out of all the grown ups...etc.Marlon Wayans looks extremely funny as the baby, or the little man. And that's pretty much what's funny about Little Man.Not really recommendedD+

Christian Bale (Batman Begins) shines in this small underrated gem about a factory worker named Trevor Reznik who is suffering from severe paranoia and a serious case of insomnia and weight loss.He hasn't slept in a year, and his health is not great- he's losing weight at an alarming rate. And worst of all, he encounters things and people, creepy as they may be especially his co-worker Ivan, that seemingly exist only in his head (or do they?).The only people he can turn to for a little bit of comfort are Stevie, his next door prostitute neighbor and occasional lover, and Marie, a waitress at an airport snack bar.You will feel hypnotized and entrapped as you follow Trevor in his demonic nightmare trying to figure out what all the sticky notes are about, who all these people are that he is encountering, and whether or not they are plotting against him and why. I will stop right here because the movie holds many secrets and surprises along the way.What keeps the movie highly interesting is Bale's incredible performance -he actually shed 63 pounds to play the role, something that will make such sophisticated charactor actors as Robert De Niro jealous!Overall, The Machinist is an extraordinary film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, and keep you on the edge of your seat.A top notch psychological thriller!RecommendedA-

From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.Hitch is a romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and starring Will Smith (Bad Boys), Eva Mendes (Out Of Time), and comedian Kevin James.Smith plays Alex Hitchens (a.k.a. Hitch), a love doctor, who helps desperate single men make the right moves and get the women of their dreams. Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for. On the other hand, Hitch begins falling for Sara, a columnist for a major New York newspaper, who is following up on a story on Allegra Cole and her unknown hubby, Albert, and one woman who thinks the love doctor is nothing but a manipulative man who tricks women but doesn't know who he is in person. I think you get the picture as to where the movie goes next.Will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor. Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics. Those are only two of the reasons why Hitch works.The movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!RecommendedA-

American History X is a powerful film directed by Tony Kaye, and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation).The movie is about racism in American society, focusing on a white suburban man named Derek Vinyard, played brilliantly by Norton, who following the death of his father on the hands of a black man, becomes an active member of a white supremacy group led by Cameron Alexander, played by Keach. His ideals are all about ridding their society and ultimately the country from all the immigrants and minority groups who as he believes have infested the good white culture with poverty and struggle in 'their' own land. The events of the film are recollections, shot in black and white, of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Furlong, who witnessed his older brother murder a black kid outside their home and get arrested. While Derek is in jail, he comes to a realization that everything he stood and fought for was an ill cause, and finally redeems himself; he comes out only to find that his own flesh and blood is following in his footsteps.American History X is a very intriguing movie about redemption, discussing some very delicate and serious issues that are infesting in American society on a daily basis. What makes the movie so powerful is Edward Norton (he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his excellent performance) who delivers his best onscreen performance to date.RecommendedA

Groundhog Day is the funniest movie of the 90's. Brilliant performance by Bill Murray who plays a cocky weatherman Phil Connors who covers Groundhog day every year in the small town of Punxatawnee that he hates. The day end with him being stuck there because of a blizzard that he didn't predict...and what more, he relives groundhog day over and over again...taking advantage of it, taking his own life, making a move on his producer Andie Macdowell which turns out to be his first lesson in reviewing his inner cruelty and becoming a better person, and a local hero!This movie is straight out funny...it will make you crack up with every viewing. Watch out for Stephen Tobolowski in his bizarre role as Ned Ryerson, and a cameo appearance by the film's director (and Murray's costar in Ghostbusters) Harold Ramis.The features are well worth the money too.

Howard Stern is the world's most famous radio DJ. He's obnoxious, sleazy, perverted, silly, and overrated. However, his 1997 semi-biographical film Private Parts, adapted from the book with the same title, is outrageously funny.The movie gives us a closer look at Howard's college years, his beginnings on live radio, and rise to fame. But the movie focuses more on his romantic life with his wife-to-be Allison, played by Mary McCormack, his hysterical confrontations with WNBC's executive, the one Howard calls Pig Vomit, played by the even more hysterical Paul Giamatti, and his collaboration with long time partners Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, played by themselves.I personally do not approve of or like Howard's show, but this movie cracked me up laughing when I first saw it, and still does today.RecommendedB+

American Beauty is a spectacular movie directed by Sam Mendes (Jarhead, Road To Perdition), and starring Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects), Annette Bening (The Grifters), Chris Cooper (Adaptation), Mena Suvari (American Pie), Peter Gallager (Short Cuts), Thora Birch (Now And Then), and Wes Bentley (Soul Survivors).Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a burnt out middle-aged man who's wife and daughter both think he's a gigantic loser. He knows this and plans to change it all by reliving his younger years before he's killed in less than a year; of course he doesn't know that yet! He meets his daughter's conceited best friend Angela, played by Suvari, and immediately becomes infatuated with her. This begins a period of change for Lester who quits his job, buys the car of his dreams, smokes pot with his young new neighbor and daughter's admirer Ricky Fitts, played by Bentley, and works out to "look good naked". His wife Carolyn, played by Bening, on the other hand wants to hit the big time in the real estate world and starts a sexual affair with the real estate king Buddy Kane, played by Gallagher. His daughter Jane, played by Birch, is an insecure teenager who somehow befriends Angela who is stuck up and, as we find out later in the film, phony. She finds love in neighbor Ricky, whose father Col. Frank Fitts, played by Cooper, is an abusive former military officer.The movie successfully follows each character as the script builds up to the unevitable conclusion with Lester being killed. Director Mendes focuses most on Lester's character, who becomes the hero of the film as he is the only adult in the film who remains loyal and honest, but doesn't neglect the other characters. The best part of American Beauty is watching Kevin Spacey act like an irresponsible young man: smoking pot, benching weights, quitting his job, and fantasizing about Suvari.American Beauty garnered several well deserved Oscars in 2000, including Best Picture, Best Director (Mendes), and Best Actor (Spacey).One of the most memorable movies of the past 10 years!RecommendedA

Jared Hess, the man behind 2004's sleeper hit Napolean Dynamite, returns with the explosively hilarious comedy, Nacho Libre.Jack Black (King Kong, School of Rock) plays Ignacio, known as Nacho, an orphan raised at a Mexican monestary, and assigned to serve the orphanage by cooking the food for the children. However, Nacho has other ambitions in life, and that is to become a successful wrestler, and win the heart of the new nun, the beautiful Encarnacion, played by Ana de la Reguera. He picks out a wrestling partner, a skinny homeless bum named Esqueleto, played by Hector Jimenez, dons a suit and mask and goes out secretly at night to the rings, fights it out, loses, and makes some serious money. He eyes the greatest fighter Ramses, played by Cesar Gonzalez, as his next opponent because if he wins he'll make enough money to buy the monestary a bus for the children to go on trips, and prove to Encarnacion and everybody else that wrestling is not a sin.Jack Black is hilarious as Nacho Libre. However, the best thing about the movie is Jared Hess's unconventional directing, made famous in Napolean Dynamite, the film's quirky dialogue and punch lines, and the one-dimensional character's personalities and body languages.Like Napolean, Nacho Libre is definitely a winner!RecommendedB+

It was 43 years ago today...when the Beatles conquered the music charts with timeless classics, and stole the hearts of pretty much everybody on the planet. Almost half a century later, two of the founding members, John and George, are deceased, and here we have the third founding member, Paul, still releasing records. Who knew?What's different about Paul's latest album, Memory Almost Full, is that the aging artist is more aware of his status amongst musical legends, and yet isn't frightened to face the audience with a song like the wonderful The End Of The End, where he explains what he would like to happen on the day he dies, "on the day that I die, I'd like bells to be rung, and songs that were sung, to be hung out like blankets..." The staightforward comment sets a certain theme to the album, which to some might seem dark and sad, but not at all. Let's not forget that Paul has lost his former bandmate George and wife of 30 years, Linda, just over the past 10 years.Memory Almost Full is Paul's love message to the fans that have adored him since it all began, the younger fans who follow in his footsteps, and his old friends. The opening track, Dance Tonight, is an ode to Paul's earliest work circa McCartney, a nice, catchy accoustic number where Paul declares that everybody should just have some fun; in other words, an excellent way to begin an album. The album also features some of Paul's best work in recent times. Ever Present Past, one of my favorites on Memory, is a delightful slow rocker and surefire hit, if it's ever released as a single, where Paul sings about how he dealt with his famous past and how it "flew by in a flash". The splendid Gratitude is where Paul pays his respect and many thanks to the fans and everybody who's loved him over the years. On the medley that includes Vintage Clothes, That Was Me, and Feet In The Clouds (an obvious homage to the b-side of Abbey Road), Paul indulges further in self-reflection creating one of Paul's greatest contributions to modern rock. Mr. Bellamy could be Paul's first psychedelic experimentation since Sgt. Pepper's. It's a cross between Eleanor Rigby, and John Lennon mind benders like Tomorrow Never Knows, a track so good it could easily fit on Revolver, Abbey Road, or even Sgt Pepper. The dark hard rockers Only Mama Knows and House Of Wax, which is another of my favorites, show Paul's ability to pen powerful rock songs, with some banging guitar solos to go with it, echoing his classic Helter Skelter from 1968's The White Album. Of course, no Paul album could go without sweet ballads, which in this case comes to us in the form of You Tell Me, and See Your Sunshine, a warm bluesy song which ranks up there as one of Paul's finest songs ever.I haven't felt this excited about a former Beatle's solo album in a long time. Memory Almost Full not only delivers the goods that will satisfy any Beatle-hungry fan like myself, but it's also the closest thing you'll ever get to McCartney, the man, artist, and living legend.Track picks:Dance TonightEver Present PastSee Your SunshineMr. BellamyVintage ClothesThat Was MeFeet In The CloudsHouse Of WaxThe End Of The EndHighly RecommendedA

Neil Young is a rock veteran who's been around since the 1960's. Known as one of the prominent anti-war figures and outspoken rock stars, Young revisits his old ways with this brand new verbal attack on the government's policies, specifically George W. Bush and his war on Iraq.Since September 2001, very few artists and rock bands have made any statements regarding Bush's war on "terror", instead focusing more on the hiphop culture induced rubbish of women (or ho's), money and latest model cars; in other words, the music scene is becoming more brainless, repetitive, and just plain stupid.Thanks to people, or artists, like Green Day (2004's American Idiot), Pearl Jam (their most recent self titled album), and now Neil Young who have made the effort of opposing the cultural norm nowadays and have spoken out against Dubya and his absurd foreign policies. I just wish all other artists will follow suit.Living With War is an outstanding collection of 10 songs written by Young, recorded in less than a month, and released instantly to the public. Young goes straight to the point talking about how disgusted he is with the war in Iraq on After The Garden, a call for peace on Living With War, a possible solution for all the problems and lies on The Restless Consumer, where Young repeatedly chants "don't need no more lies", soldiers coming back home in coffins in Shock And Awe, and, my personal favorite, the self explanatory Let's Impeach The President, which features Bush soundbites where he is apparently contradicting himself.Not since the days of Buffalo Springfield or Crosby Stills And Nash has Neil Young made any political statements through song, but with Living With War, he has successfully delivered the first significant protest album of the decade.RecommendedA

Dead Presidents is an engaging war movie directed by Allen and Albert Hughes, also known as the Hughes brothers (From Hell), and featuring an excellent cast including Larenz Tate (Crash), Chris Tucker (Rush Hour), Keith David (There's Something About Mary), Bokeem Woodbine (Almost Heroes), and Terrence Howard (Hustle And Flow).Tate plays Anthony Curtis, a young African American, who joins the army straight out of high school in 1969, fights in Vietnam, and returns to America to find no respect and no job anywhere. Anthony then plans a doomed heist with his former war buddies including the heroin addicted Skip, played by the electrifying and hilarious Tucker, pool hall owner and big time hustler named Kirby, played by David, and priest, played by Woodbine.What makes Presidents an extraordinary film is its depiction of black life before, during, and after the Vietnam war, and how they (the black veterans) got it worse than their peers, and a remarkable screenplay. The movie also succeeds in bringing about a well designed late 60's, early 70's theme with the music, fashion, and lingo.RecommendedB+

I remember listening to Supertramp when I was just a little boy in the early eighties. I didn't know the name of the band. I just knew the famous catchy tunes and the signature BeeGees-type voice of its singers. It's Raining Again and Give A Little Bit are the songs I really remember getting hooked on. I just love the theme and sound of those songs...and more.This compilation is probably the best Supertramp greatest hits album they can come out with. Its got all the big hits, the highlights are: Breakfast In America, a sweet little pop song; Goodbye Stranger, another sweet pop song that the lyrics of will play back in your head everytime you read the title (ok, you can stop now!); The Logical Song, a logical choice, this song was one of Supertramp's biggest singles and it is possibly their best written song; From Now On, a nice sing along; Its Raining Again and Give A Little Bit, for the reasons listed above.RecommendedA-

Grosse Pointe Blank is a fabulous dark comedy in the vein of Pulp Fiction, where violence and humor mix wonderfully. The movie stars John Cusack (Say Anything), Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting), Alan Arkin (Glengarry Glen Ross), Joan Cusack (The School Of Rock), Jeremy Piven (Scary Movie 3), and Dan Aykroyd (Trading Places).Cusack plays Martin Blank, a ruthless hitman who meets with a psychiatrist, played by Arkin, who wants nothing to do with him, lives on the west coast, and recieves an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe where he'll have to make amends with Debi, played by Driver, the girl he stood up 10 years ago, escape a goon who's trying to kill him and Grocer, played by Aykroyd, a rival hitman who is forcing him to join a hitman union. Once in Grosse Pointe, Blank is up for one surprise after another including a change of heart, and lifestyle, for the girl that he loves, and his final mark who happens to be her father.Grosse Pointe Blank is one of my all time favorite comedies. The script is slick and funny, and Cusack simply lights up the screen in his most dynamic performance to date. In addition to that, the fight scene in the school hallway is classic!RecommendedA

No Retreat No Surrender is a classic 80's indie film that introduced the world to cheesy "karate" films inspired by The Karate Kid and Jean Claude Van Damme.The movie stars Kurt McKinney as a wimp named Jason whose dad gets beaten up by a Russian guy named Ivan, played by Van Damme.

Just when he thinks he can never learn karate, Bruce Lee's ghost appears to him and turns him into a fighting machine. In the meantime, the Russian arrives to fight for a championship against the karate bullies...and the rest is history.No Retreat No Surrender is one of those movies that connects me to my past childhood years.

No Retreat No Surrender 2 is a cheesy 80's action flick directed by Corey Yuen, who also directed the original. Part 2 has no connection to the original. None of the characters return from No Retreat, and the storyline takes a 180 degree turn.The film follows Scott, played by Loren Avedon, who arrives in Southeast Asia, witnesses his girl getting kidnapped by Russians, and finds himself tangled up in a vengeful rescue attempt with buddy Mac, played by Max Thayer, and his love interest Terry, played by Cynthia Rothrock, in the moutainous regions of Cambodia and battles it out with the Russian forces.No Retreat No Surrender 2 also goes by the title Raging Thunder. It features gory and intense action sequences and a much more monstrous bad guy played by Matthius Hues. However, the film remains nostalgic to me since I have seen this film many times when I was young.RecommendedB+

In 1991, Nirvana exploded into the rock music scene with Nevermind. Two years later, Nirvana were still the most powerful band in the world with millions of records sold and millions of fans across the globe. During this time, Kurt Cobain, the band's frontman, was growing tired and weary of the media's exploitation of Nirvana. The price of fame was on his shoulders, and only his shoulders, to pay.In 1993, Nirvana returned with a massive rock album that, to many Nirvana fans, sounded better than its predecessor. The album delivers some of Nirvana's finest tunes: the crunching opener Serve The Servants, the hardcore Scentless Apprentice and Rape Me, the elusive Heart-Shaped Box, the heartbreaking Dumb, the melodic Pennyroyal Tea, and the beautifully written All Apologies.2 months after the release of In Utero, Nirvana recorded an awesome edition of MTV Unplugged in New York (the session has been released since 1994 and is titled Unplugged In New York). 5 months after Unplugged, the band, Nirvana, was no more.In April 1994, Kurt Cobain committed suicide. Cobain's troubled mind and despair can be felt clearly on the tracks of In Utero. Troubled as it may be, the album remains to be one of the best rock albums of the 90's.RecommendedA-

Eminem's second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, is loved by many, and hated by many others! And that's well understood.I was one of those who hated it. But there's one thing I can't deny, and that is it has some really addictive beats that will make any hip-hop hater...love it!Eminem, or shall I say Marshall (or is it Slim Shady?), isn't ashamed of expressing his hatred towards his mother (extremely dysfunctional and sick), wife (perverse), homosexuals (I hate them too!), boy bands, the media, and more people. However, Dr Dre's production and Eminem's rhymes are infectious: the vicious The Way I Am, the creative Stan (a song about an obsessed fan), and the satirical The Real Slim Shady.Whether you agree with Eminem or not, The Marshall Mathers LP is classic hip-hop at its most rotten!RecommendedB-

There hasn't been a movie ever since Pulp Fiction that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a genius form of storytelling.The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) and Kate Winslett (Titanic), Sunshine is an instant classic.The movie might be a little awkward, but the detailed direction of Michael Gondry gives you no excuse not to be able to follow along understanding what is going on. The film is about a shy man named Joel who meets an eccentric girl named Clementine (like the song!) and immediately they fall in love.Clementine's behavior takes a toll with Joel who begins distrusting her, so Clementine leaves him and erases him out of her memory with the help of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak, played by Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson. Joel goes crazy as a result and ends up at the same doctor's office to have his memory cleaned up of all memory of Clementine.Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind from here on. The essence of the picture is that Joel realizes, as his treasured memories of Clementine begin to fade away one after the other, that he still loves Clementine and attempts to get out of the procedure before it's too late.Jim Carrey is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future. Winslett, who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for Carrey.Eternal Sunshine is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years.Highly recommendedA+

If someone asked me what I thought of Green Day ten years ago, I would have said they were a bunch of punks who could write some catchy tunes but seemed utterly crazy. I would have never predicted back then up until now that this Californian trio could ever write an epic masterpiece that would stand out to become THE album of our times in the same sense that Pink Floyd, The Beatles or The Who defined their times with concept albums that will forever be remembered.American Idiot can be easily compared to Tommy and The Wall in the sense that the album chronicles a fictitious character (St. Jimmy or Jesus of Suburbia in this case) through the times that America is currently living in. You can feel the frustration, anger, and disapproval of a generation in the 13 tracks of this mega rock opus. Like the two albums I've mentioned earlier in additon to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, American Idiot is the modern day concept album that will be remembered as long as there's rock 'n roll.The title track, American Idiot, is the perfect way to open up the record as it signals the fact that Americans are consumed and brainwashed by the political Americanization system tool called the media. Billy Joe Armstrong, the band's frontman, with his engaging vocals and ripping lyrics describes those who allow the government to take over their way of thinking as idiots, but that's only another way of introducing the main character of this rock opera, a kid named Jesus (or is it St. Jimmy?) who refuses to go with the flow.Jesus Of Suburbia is introduced quite well in the second track, a 5 part episode that shows Jesus as a typical dysfunctional American youth hooked on pop and Ritalin, smokes marijuana, is religiously clueless, and watches TV all day while his mom is out with who knows who. In City Of The Damned, Armstrong does some character background to show how lost Jesus is in a land that misleads to nowhere. With this, Jesus is outraged and this is revealed awesomely in I Don't Care, where he describes everybody as "full of sh*t" and how the land doesn't believe in him and how he just simply doesn't care anymore. The feelings of confusion deepens in Dearly Beloved where Jesus questions whether he (and the youth) is demented, disturbed or just retarded.In the following track Holiday, one of the album's highlights, the war in Iraq is refered to a lot and Bush is called President Gazman. With Holiday, the frustration that Jesus of Suburbia is feeling has become a nation wide epidemic. Armstrong begs the public to "dream and differ from the hollow lies", the lies erupting from the pre-Iraq war of WMD's and so forth, adding more fuel to the fire of frustration of the American youth. On Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Jesus finds himself walking alone in search of the American dream that he was raised to believe exists, but only finds himself lost in the real world where the dreams are broken. Are We The Waiting is the youth questioning in added frustration who they are, where Jesus denies himself and begins creating a new image and a new personality, a more outraged and angry character named St. Jimmy. At this point, Jesus's, or Jimmy's, life starts changing. He meets a girl named Whatsername, who is described well on the catchy pop tune Extraordinary Girl, and gets hooked on novocaine to keep the pains of the past away, chronicled well on Give Me Novocaine. It's a family tragedy and the death of his father that brings him back to his conscience, the sweet and breathtaking Wake Me Up When September Ends was actually written by Billy Joe to commemorate his deceased father but the song fits well into the story of Jimmy. Jimmy snaps out of his over-the-edge second personality and returns to old self, the more humble and controlled Jesus of Suburbia as a result and like other people of his generation, he grows up. Jesus becomes a hard working employee on 12th Street filling out paperwork, but deep down inside his American dream has not been fulfilled. He'd rather be out and about again. He lost Whatsername because of his dramatic change and Nobody Likes (You) him anymore. This stage in Jesus's life is chronicled completely in the 5 part episode of Homecoming, a stage where you sense the routine and boredom that has now over taken him just like every other typical American. Jesus has come full circle.American Idiot is quite an engaging album in the fact that it sounds really good. Each track is a hit single in its own right despite its connection to the next one. Green Day have succeeded in inventing a record that tells a story from beginning to end while entertaining the listener with excellently produced and well polished catchy songs.Definitely, the best album of our time.Track picks:American IdiotJesus of Suburbia*HolidayBoulevard of Broken DreamsAre We The WaitingGive Me NovocaineExtraordinary GirlWake Me Up When September Ends* includes all five (5) parts of medleyHighly recommendedA+

Click is the latest collaborative work between director Frank Coraci and actor Adam Sandler, both have worked together on The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy. Their latest film attempts to enter new territories, fantasy and melodrama, along with the usual toilet humor. The result is a heavily cliched, predictable, and messy film that seems to lose direction and doesn't know where it is taking the viewers.Click has its highlight moments- any film that has a premise involving a remote control that controls time and space is bound to have the funnies. However, the movie's message, that we learn long before midway through the film, is that family comes first.Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect who cares more about getting a promotion from his superior, played by a creepy David Hasselhoff, than spending quality time with his wife, played by Kate Beckinsale, and kids. He also has a problem using the right remote control to turn on the TV- one that turns on the ceiling fan, another that operates a toy car - which doesn't make sense (What kind of a person can't tell one remote from the other?). He drives out to a Bed Bath and Beyond, enters the Beyond section where he meets the mysterious Morty, played by Christopher Walken, who gives him a magical remote for free. The remote turns out to be a controller of Michael's life. He skips through time to when he's promoted, arguments with his wife, and sickness. The film then takes a turn into a melodramtic tale of when Michael realizes that he's skipped through very important events and struggles to go back and get things fixed.It seems to me that the writers of the film were trying to be creative with the script, however, the movie turns out looking and feeling too immature. Somebody should have seriously clicked off the script and made a rewrite somewhere along the line.The movie has its moments, but it's not as remarkable as Sandler and Coraci's other two films.Not really recommendedC-

I said it before and I'll say it again: The Beatles were, and still are, the best band that ever walked the earth. Since their big break around 1963, the fab four never hit and missed. Each album they made was hailed as their best work. And after 8 years and somewhere around 13 albums, give or take, it's really hard to point out their best album. Actually, it's impossible.However, one thing is for sure and that is that their 1966 album Revolver symbolized a clear transitional point for the boys from balladeering teenyboppers to mature and serious musical artists.Revolver, which follows in the footsteps of previous album Rubber Soul, comes fully loaded with songs that speak little or nothing about love and dabbles into topics never before discussed by any other band, The Beatles included; take Harrison's funny Taxman, McCartney's social commentary take on Eleanor Rigby (a subliminal response to Lennon's excellent Nowhere Man from Rubber Soul), Lennon's ode to the man who introduced LSD to him and the boys Doctor Robert, the highly experimental Tomorrow Never Knows and She Said She Said (in which heavy drug use triggered the writing of both), and I'm Only Sleeping, a song about laziness. On the other hand, The Beatles return to old form on songs like Lennon's witty And Your Bird Can Sing, McCartney's beautiful Here There And Everywhere and For No One, and rock poppin' Got To Get You Into My Life and Good Day Sunshine, while Ringo gives his voice on the classic children song Yellow Submarine (which would go on to inspire an animated film with the same title starring the boys).RecommendedA

Automatic For The People is REM's 1993 album released as follow up to the successful Out Of Time. The album is unique in REM's discography in that it relies heavily on string arrangements, which gives the album a nice, cozy, and sentimental feel.The albums kicks off with the outstanding Drive before driving us through 11 tracks of pure excellence that includes the brilliant Try Not To Breathe and The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite, the heartbreaking hit single Everybody Hurts (a song once dedicated to the late Nirvana frontman, and Michael Stipe's friend Kurt Cobain), the politically charged Ignoreland, the elusive Sweetness Follows and Star Me Kitten, the Andy Kaufman ode and hit single Man On The Moon (the song that would eventually become the foundation for a movie of the same title in 1999 starring Jim Carrey as Kaufman), the ethereal Nightswimming, and the folksy album closer Find The River.REM went on to release other powerful albums in the years that followed Automatic, most notably Monster, but Automatic stands out as an album that really pulled me in, and made me appreciate REM to this day.One of the greatest albums ever released!RecommendedA

On December 8, 1980 at approximately 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, a musical genius came to an abrupt and tragic end; John Lennon, founder of the best rock band that ever walked the earth The Beatles, was shot and killed outside his home in New York City just minutes after returning from a recording session. The world fell into a state of shock. People cried, mourned, and could not believe that the man they grew up listening to and were influenced by was gone forever.Double Fantasy, his final effort released just the previous month, featured John and Yoko in John's first collection of original songs in over 5 years. The album is not entirely classic material (Plastic Ono Band and Imagine still top Lennon's best achievements) due to the fact that only half the songs are written and sung by John; the other half is written and sung by Yoko, hence the title Double Fantasy. However, the fact that it was John's last album made it a popular favorite and the 1981 Grammy award winner for Album of the Year. What may make some listeners weep while listening to Fantasy is John's calm and pleasant attitude, and optimistic vision of what the 80's should be and sound like. Unfortunately, 1980 was the only part of the 80's that John survived.The album features some of John's best songs: the renewed love vow to Yoko, Just Like Starting Over, the greatest love ballad ever written Woman, the song about laziness Watching The Wheels, the dark and hard rocking I'm Losing You, the sweet lullaby Beautiful Boy (written for his son Sean), the brilliant Cleanup Time, and the usual dedication to his wife of 11 years, Dear Yoko.The other part of Double Fantasy features songs written by Yoko for John, in which John responded to with his batch of songs. The highlight of Yoko's songs is the US Top 20 dance hit Kiss Kiss Kiss, which was also featured as the b-side to first single and Number 1 hit Just Like Starting Over.Despite his death, Lennon's discography does not end at Double Fantasy, 1983's posthumous Milk And Honey features songs that John was recording right before he passed away.RecommendedB

The movie Cop Land combines long lost talent in its leading star, Sylvester Stallone; top notch performances from its supporting cast, Ray Liotta, Robert Deniro, Harvey Keitel, and Annabella Sciorra; wonderful cinematography by Eric Edwards; and brilliant direction of James Mangold who later went on to direct such hits as Kate And Leopold, Identity, and Girl Interrupted.Cop Land is a fictional tale of crime and corruption in a city run and occupied by New York's unfinest cops. Stallone pulls it off excellently as the city's overweight sherrif, Freddie Heflin, who couldn't get into to the force on account of his deaf ear. When the police force covers up a cop shooting that leaves two innocent men dead and stages a hero story, its up to Sherrif Heflin to reveal the truth and bring order to the city known to everybody as Cop Land.The movie features an outstanding performance by Robert Deniro as an FBI agent trying to uncover the deceptions and opens Heflin's eyes to the corruption around him.A memorable film with an even more memorable ensemble cast.

Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer is their finest offering to date.The bizzare concept album about computers taking over and dehumanizing us people is as good as it is confusing.Thom Yorke sings his heart out on each grand track that embodies one of the most brilliant albums of recent memory: the excellent first single Paranoid Android, the gripping Bob Dylan borrowed title Subterranean Homesick Alien, the sad and elusive Let Down and Exit Music (For A Film), the hard hitting and amazing hit single Karma Police, the sentimental No Surprises, the computerized spoken track Fitter Happier, and the rocking Climbing Up The Walls.Whatever the band were intending to say with the title of the album, all you have to know is that this 'computer' is beyond OK, it's a classic!RecommendedA

In 1998, The Verve broke up. The band had been making music together for a long time but they hadn't reached the height of success until a year earlier when Urban Hymns became a mega hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Now, Richard Ashcroft, the founder and frontman of The Verve, was on his own setting the record straight to everybody.Alone With Everybody is a well constructed and vibrant record with 11 over the top tracks. This is The Verve stripped down to the one man that mattered the most in the entire group. So, if you are a Verve fan, you shouldn't be too saddened with their fallout.The album begins with A Song For The Lovers which is a rich love ballad. This track along with the rest of the album can fit in easily on Urban Hymns. The dazzling effort put on songs like Brave New World, Crazy World, New York, and I Get My Beat make this solid debut a clear mark on today's music industry which was able to dull the album's voice in the market taken over by cheap noise. C'mon People is the reason why Ashcroft is a very important singer/songwriter today. Here he makes pop but in no way comparable with the lameness of boy band pop. The song like all others have conviction in the voice of its singer and attitude in the music. The one thing I love the most about Alone With Everybody is its sentimental rhythm and touching orchestrations. You On My Mind In My Sleep, for instance, is the most beautiful mindblowing ballad I have ever heard. I can almost gaurantee that somebody somewhere heard this song and began to weep.Ashcroft delivers his signature sound on his first solo effort. But considering that The Verve would have done nothing without him, Alone With Everybody is the most powerful Verve album right after Urban Hymns.Highly RecommendedA

Stand By Me has always been one of my all-time favorite movies. The chemistry between the four boys out to find the body of a kid their age has always been an inspiration for me growing up.Rob Reiner's direction is tops. How he managed to get those four boys to act their hearts out is still a mystery today. The best comes out of River Phoenix as the troubled leader of the pack Chris Chambers, and Jerry O' Connell's part as the way-too-innocent scaredy cat Vern Tessio, Corey Feldman's turn as the crazy Teddy Duchamp, and Will Wheaton as the narrator of the story, the more focused than the others Gordon Lachance. Cameos by Richard Dreyfuss as the older Gordon, and John Cusack as Gordon's deceased brother Denny add an overwhelming feeling of delight to the entirety of this magnificent movie.Special features include a behind the scenes of the film plus interviews with nearly the entire cast, a tribute to River Phoenix, Ben E King's music video of the theme song Stand By Me and commentary by director Rob Reiner.This is one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen it, you don't get bored of watching again.Highly Recommended

Reservoir Dogs is a cult classic written and directed by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill), and starring Tim Roth (Pulp Fiction), Harvey Keitel (Taxi Driver), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill Volume 2), Steve Buscemi (Fargo), the late Chris Penn (Footloose, Rush Hour), and Tarantino himself.Dogs is the first film by Tarantino that paved the way for his second and most successful film to date, the revolutionary Oscar winning Pulp Fiction.The film follows a group of thieves who go by aliases that represent colors: Pink, Brown, Orange, White... They've just planned a major heist that eventually goes terribly wrong after the cops show up. It turns out as we follow the events of the film that an undercover cop, played by Roth, had infiltrated their gang by posing to be one of them.The movie features extraordinary performances by the entire cast, especially Madsen in his most sadistic role to date as the crazy Mr. Blonde (the torture scene where Blonde cuts off the cop's ear and pours gasoline all over him has become one of the most memorable scenes in motion picture history). But what makes Dogs, and all other Tarantino films, an exciting film is the realistic and funny dialogue.The special edition DVD of the movie is a must have with tons of features including interviews with the cast about making the film.RecommendedA

Clerks is American filmmaker Kevin Smith's directual debut. The film cost about 25,000 to make, and went on to gross 3 million at the box office -not bad at all for a first movie. Today, the movie is viewed as a cult classic, quoted by many, and revered as Kevin Smith's best film to date -even after movies with bigger budgets.Dante Hicks, played by Brian O'Halloran, is called in to work at a New Jersey convenient store on a Saturday. He gets there to find that the shutters won't open, the customers that will walk in on that particular day all have major issues, two stoners Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith respectively, that hang around right outside his door all day, and his next door video store clerk buddy Randal, played by Jeff Anderson, is less excited about being at work than he is. In additon to that, he had arranged plans that day to play hockey - which he ends up doing on the roof of the store, and finds out a dirty secret from his woman that explodes into a fight and a possible affair with an old flame.The film's plot might seem pointless, but Kevin Smith's hilarious dialogue makes Clerks an enjoyable film, plus the movie is shot in black and wite that gives it a sense of coolness. The movie also introduced the world to the quirky characters Jay and Silent Bob, who would end up appearing in all of Smith's future films.Most importantly, Clerks has become an inspiration for many young American directors to make their mark with the smallest and most affordable budget possible.RecommendedB+

Tears For Fears was one of the hottest bands of the 80's. The band consisted of two men: Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.Their crisp pop/rock hippy-ish tunes and stadium rockers cemented the band's position on the charts and their status in rock history.Although many consider Tears For Fears a nostalgic act that was begging to vanish away; their classics cannot be denied: the Beatlesque Sowing The Seeds Of Love, the anthemic mega hit Everybody Wants To Rule The World, the mellow Woman In Chains, the stadium rockers and fan favorites Shout and Head Over Heals, the elusive Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down), and the groovy Mothers Talk.Even though the band are not as big as they used to be, shed no tears for Tears For Fears, their best 80's music is timeless and it's all here on Tears Roll Down.RecommendedB-

Assassins is a cool action drama directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon), and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), Antonio Banderas (Mask Of Zorro), and Julianne Moore (Hannibal).Stallone plays our anti-hero Robert Rath, a professional hitman who is at the top of his game but getting tired of the whole thing and wants out. Before he can make such a decision, his employer whom he doesn't see but recieves jobs from on the computer assigns him to retire one more mark, a computer hacker known as Electra, played by Moore. The problem that Rath is about to encounter is Miguel Bain, played remarkably by Banderas, another professional hitman who's out to get the same mark and kill Rath to become number one. The film turns into a cat and mouse game between Rath and Bain.Director Donner succeeds in focusing less on the action, but more on the characters themselves and the interactions between them. There is no major body count nor is there the sound of gunshots or machine guns (all the guns in the film are silenced), and nor are there that many explosions, except for the scene where Bain gets blown out of a kitchen window.RecommendedB-

Out of all the Rocky movies, the third sequel to the Oscar winning original movie Rocky (1976) has the best soundtrack. Rocky IV came out in 1985 in the midst of the 80's synch pop and hair bands. But there is little or no indication that Stallone or whoever put these songs together was highly appreciative of that dreadful music scene.Survivor returns to the soundtrack of yet another Rocky sequel after their successful 1982 Rocky III theme song Eye Of The Tiger. This time they contribute Burning Heart, an even more ambitious and powerful song about the east and west clash (america and the soviet union). James Brown offers Living In America. John Cafferty's adrenaline fueled Hearts On Fire shows up twice in the movie and that only indicates that it's the highlight on the soundtrack. Kenny Loggins, the king of 80's soundtrack hits such as Footloose and Danger Zone, makes a modest appearance on Rocky IV with Gladys Knight on the bluesy Double Or Nothing. Go West's One Way Street is another bluesy pop song that fits the soundtrack quite well. Finally, there's the instrumental tracks: War and Training Montage that are memorable as the movie itself. Of course, I'm not forgetting Robert Tepper's No Easy Way Out which comes on in the most engaging scene in the movie, when Rocky is remembering his past, Apollo Creed, and the frightful face of Drago coming to end his life.Rocky IV is one of the most bankable movies of the 80's. It also is one of the best soundtrack albums of that decade.A

North Country is a drama directed by Niki Caro, and starring Oscar wining actresses Charlize Theron (Monster), Sissy Spacek (JFK), and Frances McDormand (Fargo), Woody Harrelson (Kingpin), and Sean Bean (National Treasure).The film is about a Minnesota single mother named Josey, who takes a job at the local mine where she is sexually harrassed, and underestimated by the entire male staff. Josey gets the courage after so much humiliation with her ailing work buddy Glory, played by McDormand, and lawyer Bill, played by Harrelson, at her side, to face the workforce, the community, her coworking and disapproving father, played by Bean, and mother, played by Spacek, in a fight that will shake the very foundation of the mining industry and force a law forbidding sexual harrassment in the workplace in the future.The movie is ambitious, but fails to engage the viewers long enough.

Mustafa Akkad, the man who also brought us Lion Of The Desert, directs and produces The Message. The film is based on the story of Islam and the prophethood of Muhammed, peace and blessings be upon him. Islam in Arabic means 'submission to God', a Muslim is one who accepts Islam and therefore is a 'submitter to God' All prophets before Muhammed had been sent down with the same message of truth; to submit to God and worship Him alone. The Message reveals this as much as it reflects the true prophethood of Muhammed and the revelation of the Quran being the last revelation that God sent down to mankind.The film is well acted. Anthony Quinn plays the role of Hamza Bin Abdul Mutalib, the prophet's uncle, who was one of the first people to accept the message that his nephew had been sent with, one of the greatest warriors and early martyrs in Islam. The film is also beautifully shot in the deserts of North Africa.I recommend this film to all Muslims and non-Muslims. For the Muslims, this film will be an engaging and very emotional experience. For the non-Muslims, it will be a good lesson in knowing and understanding the truth and essence of Islam and how its message is universal and true.Muhammed, peace be upon him, is not portayed on screen because it is forbidden to resemble any prophet by another person even for artistic reasons. This does not apply only to prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him; but also to Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Noah, David and all other prophets peace and blessings be upon all of them.A

My subject line is what the title of this album should have been. Because by the summer of 1998, people doubted that Robbie could earn any respectability as a solo artist after his huge success with Life Thru A Lens, in particular his takeover of the UK charts with the hit single Angels that elevated Robbie as a mainstream pop phenomena.But September 1998 came about and Robbie dropped the bomb. An instant classic chart-topper titled I've Been Expecting You. Along with Oasis, Robbie became the only British artist who released two consequetive number one hit albums back to back one year apart.The album opens up with, surpisingly, a self confession, 'Strong' reveals that Robbie isn't who he really is in the public eye and that he is a man dealing with weaknesses and insecurity but that at the end of the day he feels happy to be making music. The track is an Oasis-esque rock song with the weirdest lyrics such as 'early mornin' when i wake up, i look like KISS but without the make-up, and that's a good line to take it to the bridge''No Regrets' is a powerful ballad, possibly more powerful than Angels. Robbie sticks and jabs at the unknown target with everything he's got. A song about losing a person you love so much and the anger and helplessness you feel that you talk to yourself about. 'Millenium' is a artsy pop song. Sounds disco with the theme of a James Bond movie. This is the song that crossed Robbie over the Atlantic and landed his first hit in America, but trust me there are way better tracks here and on his previous album than this one. 'Win Some Lose Some' features the voice of Robbie's ex and currently the love of Robbie's rival Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, Nicole Appleton. The song is a fun pop tune with those jingling acoustic guitar strums. 'Karma Killer' is powerhouse rock tune featuring a very angry Robbie. The song, like No Regrets, is a song about a guy who just lost his lover and isn't afraid to lash out at her. 'She's The One' is the best track on the entire album. A perfect mellow love song which brings out the best of Robbie's voice. 'Man Machine' is the album's own 'Let Me Entertain You', a powerful party tune and the album closer 'These Dreams' is a beautful and touching ballad about following one's dreams and not giving up on hope.The album as a whole is a artistic statement from a man who spent the previous year in success over a debut album, but not knowing whether it was luck or out of pure talent. I've Been Expecting You proves that Life Thru A Lens was not luck. Robbie is a modern day pop genius where everything he touches turns to gold.Highly RecommendedA

Die Hard is an exciting action packed movie directed by John McTiernan (Last Action Hero).The movie stars Bruce Willis as troublemaker New York cop John McClane who visits his wife in her Los Angeles workplace, a big firm called Nakatomi Corporations, at the same time a group of European terrorists take over the firm and hold everybody hostage. But they're in for a surprise, McClane is going to drive them up the walls in a cat and mouse game all around the building while the clueless LA police stands aside.The movie is similar to the Rambo films in that McClane alone battles the entire group of bad guys, but Die Hard maintains its own identity thanks to Willis' sense of humor and catchy one-liners.RecommendedB+

The Karate Kid is a classic directed by John G. Avildsen (Rocky), and starring Ralph Macchio (The Outsiders, My Cousin Vinny) as Daniel, and Noriyuki Pat Morita (Happy Days TV series) as the memorable Mr. Miyagi.The movie was released the same year Ghostbusters, Beverly Hills Cop and The Terminator became blockbusters, and it was one of the top films of that year.The story is about a teen, Daniel La Russo, who has just moved in to California with his mother. We get to experience the struggles he has to go through while trying to adapt to the new home and school. Of course, things go bad for Daniel. He gets bullyed by a group of karate champs and he just so happens to be romancing the ex of the leader of this gang, Ali (with an I) played by Elizabeth Shue. After several beatings, he is finally rescued by the quiet and mysterious maintenence man, Mr Miyagi who ends up teaching him self defense in the most awkward but profound way. The movie focuses on the close friendship that bonds between Daniel and Mr Miyagi and how Daniel learns to balance his life amidst such rough situations.The ending where Daniel goes the distance against the leader of his bullies, Johnny, played by William Zabka, who happens to be the 3 time champion of the All Valley under 18 Karate Tournament, and wins is quite breathtaking.Morita earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor that year for his mesmerizing performance as Mr Miyagi, but he lost. In my opinion, he deserved that award. It's also my opinion that The Karate Kid is one of the best films I have ever seen.RecommendedA

The Bonfire Of The Vanities is an underrated gem directed by Brian DePalma (Scarface), and featuring an all-star cast including Academy Award winners Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump), Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby, Driving Miss Daisy), F Murray Abraham (Amadeus), and a supporting cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Melanie Griffith (Shining Through), and Kim Cattrall (Turk 182).The story depicts a decaying society infested with racism, greed, hypocrisy, and corruption. The particular society in focus here is New York City, where an incident that signifies a major clash between the white upper class and the black lower class becomes media dinner. Hanks plays Sherman McCoy, a wealthy businessman who cheats on his wife, played by Cattrall, with another rich man's wife Maria Ruskin, played by Griffith.On one of their nights on the town, McCoy and Ruskin find themselves in the slums of New York, where they are jumped by two black youths, and end up committing a hit and run as they run over one of the kids as they flee in McCoy's car. This goes straight to headline news. The African American community are not pleased, the mayor of the city, played hysterically by Abraham, wants to gain Black support by taking a rich 'white' turkey to court and reprimending him; in this case, the turkey is McCoy, a religious man who's only after money, and a drunken down-on-his-luck reporter Peter Fallow, played by Willis, who's hot on McCoy's tracks for this could be the story that will bring him to the top of his game, and in the longer run, make him a star of the moment.Everybody's in for a surprise, however, to find out that Ruskin was the one driving the car, not McCoy, but the entire city wants McCoy's neck anyways. McCoy, on the other hand, must play a dirty game to clear his name even if it means that he should break the law.The Bonfire Of the Vanities has no heroes. All the characters in the movie symbolize very dirty and corrupt people. The only voice of wisdom in the film is the judge, played by Freeman, hot off his Oscar nominated performance in Driving Miss Daisy, who gives a convincing speech at the end of the movie.Even though the movie flopped in 1990 when it was released and today is considered one of the worst films ever made, I find Bonfire a truly unappreciated social commentary take on a dysfunctional system with ordinary people working as organizers of the system. It's a bittersweet slice of American realism that many people tend to walk away from.RecommendedB

Goodfellas is an astonishing motion picture directed by Martin Scorsese (Cape Fear), and starring Robert Deniro (Heat), Ray Liotta (Hannibal), Joe Pesci (Home Alone), Lorraine Bracco (TV show The Sopranos), and Paul Sorvino (The Cooler).Hailed as one of the best films in general, and best gangster film in particular, of all time, Goodfellas triumphs with an excellent cast, memorable screenplay, and accurate execution.Based on a true story, the film follows Henry Hill, played by Liotta in his starmaking role, a young Irish/Italian kid who longs to become a member of the local gang led by the quiet restaurant owner Paul Cicero, played by Sorvino. His gang includes the Irish bred Jimmy Conway, played brilliantly by Deniro, and the guncrazy Tommy Devito, played by Pesci in the role that earned him a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Goodfellas examines Hill's rise and fall with the mob, and eventually his abrupt exit from the gang after testifying against the big heads, Cicero and Conway, in a court of law in the early 80's. Today, Hill lives under federal protection.What makes Goodfellas an outstanding movie is the actual depiction of events that occurred, with all the violence and dialogue, that only Scorsese can pull off successfully with long takes (Henry and Karen's first date scene), and quick jump shots (Henry running errands under the influence of cocaine as the FBI are on the watch scene).RecommendedA+

In The Line Of Fire is an intense action thriller directed by Wolfgang Peterson (The Perfect Storm), and starring Oscar winning director Clint Eastwood (The Unforgiven), John Malkovich (Con Air), Rene Russo (Lethal Weapon 3), and Dylan McDermott (Runaway Jury).Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent who was hired to protect President John F. Kennedy, but obviously failed. 30 years later, Horrigan has become an undercover agent until he discovers a twisted lunatic Mitch Leary, played by Malkovich, who is plotting to kill the new president. Leary knows everything about Horrigan, and begins taunting him with phone calls. Horrigan finds out that Leary is smart and serious, and attempts to save the life of the president even if it means he'll have to stand in the line of fire.The highlight of In The Line Of Fire is Malkovich's brilliant performance. Eastwood proves once again that even at an old age, his 'Dirty Harry' bad*ss image is still intact.RecommendedA

Young Guns is a good 80's western directed by Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid), and starring brat packers Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club), Keifer Sutherland (The Lost Boys), Dermot Mulroney (About Schmidt), Lou Diamond Phillips (La Bamba), Casey Siemaszko (Stand By Me), and Charlie Sheen (Wall Street). The movie also stars Hollywood veterans Terence Stamp (Superman II), and the late Oscar winning actor Jack Palance (City Slickers).Guns follows the trails of the legendary William H. Bonney, also known as Billy The Kid, played by Estevez in his most memorable film role. Bonney is a delinquent who's picked up off the street by rancher John Tunstall, played by Stamp, and disciplined into becoming an educated citizen along with other boys that call themselves the regulators: Doc Scurlock, played by Sutherland, Chavez, played by Phillips, Dick Brewer, played by Sheen, Dirty Steve, played by Mulroney, and Charley, played by Siemaszko. Tunstall is brutally murdered by a group of men belonging to rival Murphy, played by Palance. The boys can't get fair justice through the law because Murphy has connections with the sherrif's office, so they're made deputies and go out to arrest the killers of their master. Bonney, however, decides to take both the law and vengeance in his own hands and leads the pack into a killing spree of revenge. The boys give up their badges and become outlaws.Young Guns features an excellent cast of, then, Hollywood's freshest new talents; over time, of course, neither actor held his own except Sutherland, who's had a successful career as the star of TV drama 24, and Sheen, who appears in slapstick comedies to make a living (e.g. Hot Shots, Scary Movie 3), while the script is made especially to attract younger audiences to watch a modern western, something Clint Eastwood would revive only 4 years later with his Academy Award winning picture Unforgiven.Many people disregard Young Guns as a bad western with young actors who'd better off becoming models. But Young Guns successfully carries the plot, silly it may be or not, and delivers good action sequences and quirky dialogue, especially Emilio Estevez's silly laugh, better than other western films.RecommendedB-

Dave Grohl and company are back in business!In Your Honor is an overall satisfying dual album offering one side of loud rock tracks and the other of softer ones.The loud section features the first single Best Of You, a catchy tune which was the reason I became curious to purchase this album in the first place. Grohl screams and shouts through mostly all of the tracks here, reaching his peak in songs like the title track In Your Honor, No Way Back, DOA, The Deepest Blues Are Black, and Resolve, a song with hit single potential.The 'not so loud' section features a mellowed out band and a softer pitched Grohl strumming and crooning through songs like Still, a song that sounds like Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Blue Sky", but a very pleasant listen as well as What If I Do?, On The Mend, Miracle, Over And Out, a song that sounds like a good future single, and Cold Day In The Sun, a top notch song that sounds like it was taken straight out of a 70's rock band recording session. However, most of the other tracks are filler: Another Round, Friend Of A Friend, and the achingly intolerable Virginia Moon which doesn't fit the mood of the album as whole with its jazzy edge.I can see that the Foo Fighters were trying to create their own White Album with this effort. Some tracks on both sides of In Your Honor do score well on the 'It rocks!' scale but others fall flat on their face, which leads me to say that In Your Honor is not an honor roll effort, but satisfying enough to buy.Track picks:In Your HonorBest Of YouDOAResolveStillWhat If I Do?Over And OutCold Day In The SunRecommendedB

Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot is a comedy directed by Roger Spottiswoode (Turner And Hooch) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), Estelle Getty (TV sitcom The Golden Girls), and JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist).Stallone plays Joey Bomowski, an LA cop who gets a surprise visit from his mother Tutti, played by Getty. She's in town to clean up Joey's house, clean up his crumbling love life with his boss Gwen, played by Williams, and clean up the city as she partners up with her son to catch some bad guys who were involved in a crime that she is the only witness to. Joey, on the other hand, must deal with his mother showing everybody she meets his baby pictures, washing his gun with water and soap, and feeding him breakfast (the most important meal of the day!)The movie is silly but mildly entertaining. Getty and Stallone's onscreen chemistry is the worst since Dolly Parton and Stallone's duet performance in Rhinestone. However, the film manages to pull some funny moments that you can't resist but laugh to.Not really recommendedC

5 years after the dreadful but watchable Rocky IV, Stallone returned to the big screen but not the ring for another Rocky sequel.In Rocky V, Rocky returns from the brutal fight with Ivan Drago to discover that he's being diagnosed with brain damage. With the now annoying nagging of Adrian, Rocky decides to retire once and for all. To make matters worse for the poor old slugger, he goes bankrupt after his accountant runs off with his fortunes.Rocky returns to the streets of Philly where he takes over Mickey's old gym. There he meets a young Oklahoma fighter named Tommy Gunn. Rocky sees a conviction in the kid and decides to take him into his home and train him to become the next champ.Cut to the chase, a loud mouthed boxing promoter named Duke, played by Richard Gant, who is a carbon copy of Don king but without the hairdo, lures young Tommy with cash and fortune and a chance at the title, something he failed to do with the stubborn and honest Rocky. Duke has plans however, and that is to bring Rocky back into the ring and the way to do that is to turn his protege against him for a fight of a lifetime (Old lion against Young lion).The movie focuses on the corruption of the boxing commission, and Rocky's family problems: Rocky's preoccupation with Tommy leaves his son Rocky Jr, played by Stallone's real life son Sage, having to learn how to cope with street life alone, causing a near family breakup.The movie succeeds in bringing back the grit and realism of the original Rocky thanks to the return of John G. Avildsen to the director's seat, something that Stallone disregarded in Rocky IV.RecommendedB-

Sylvester Stallone has been in some really bad movies; most notably Cobra and, of course, Rhinestone.In 1993, Stallone made a breakthrough, a breakthrough meaning that he made movies that people didn't walk out on! First off that year, he made Cliffhanger, which was a big domestic and worldwide box office success, and then he followed that with Demolition Man, which was his best breakthrough movie since...well, Cliffhanger.The movie mixes the usual action with humor. Sandra Bullock cuteness and Wesley Snipes' whacky hairdo and funny oneliners makes this movie watchable. Stallone plays bad-boy cop John Spartan who is frozen in time for irresponsibly taking the lives of innocent people after a bust to catch bad guy Simon Phoenix, played by Snipes, who is caught and put in an ice cube also. 36 years later, the world is a much safer place. Crime is at a rate of zero and people are well-behaved. What happens next? Simon Phoenix escapes from his prison and he is out in search of destruction and since there are no equally demented cops to catch this sort of criminal, they release Spartan to pursue him. And the fun begins! Bullock plays the role of a 90's obsessed cop who becomes Stallone's partner. Her quotes are the funniest in the entire film. ... The movie also features funny cameos by Denis Leary and Rob Schneider.Despite the movie being a mixture of action and comedy and not solely comedy, this is one of Stallone's funniest roles to date.The DVD features only include the trailer and shot-by-shot commentary by the film's director Marco Brambilla. But for the movie's sake, this DVD is worth keeping!RecommendedB

At Close Range is a dark but outstandingly beautiful movie starring Sean Penn (I Am Sam) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter) and directed by James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross). Based on a true story of the Johnston family crimes. The name was changed for dramatic purposes to Whitewood.Sean Penn plays young Brad Jr who is lured by Brad Sr, played remarkably by Walken, into his gang of thieves. When Brad Jr finds out that the gang does more than just steal, but also murder, he decides to walk out leading the movie to the very frightful and haunting events that followed.The movie was nominated only for a Berlin International Film Festival award. Why it was not nominated for any Golden Globes or Oscars is a mystery. The movie presents very strong performances from its lead actors as well as the supporting cast that includes Mary Stuart Masterson, Crispin Glover, Keifer Sutherland, and Sean Penn's younger brother Chris Penn.The movie also has an incredibly bittersweet musical score, taken from Madonna's wonderful song 'Live To Tell'Very RecommendedA

Kill Bill Volume 2 is an amazing spectacle directed by the best filmmaker in Hollywood today, Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs), and starring Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), and Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs).Kill Bill Volume 2 delivers yet another heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords and quirky dialogue. The movie begins where Volume 1 left off: The Bride, now revealed as Beatrix Kiddo, played by Thurman, has just killed two of her former co-members in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Vernita Green, played by Vivica A. Fox, and O-Ren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu. Now, Beatrix is determined to get to the leader of them all and once she does she will kill Bill, played by Caradine, but not before she confronts the one-eyed maniac Elle Driver, played by Hannah, in the most memorable fight scene of all Kill Bill films, and Bud, played by Madsen, Bill's trailer dwelling brother. Along the way, we are finally introduced to Bill (in the first Volume, Bill is heard but not seen). We're also given Bill's motives for ordering the assault on the Texas church where The Bride, her fiance and companions were brutally massacred by the DiVAS. The sequel also explores how Kiddo, or The Bride, was trained into becoming a killing machine, and, finally, introduces us to the fate of The Bride's baby and who the father is.Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 have been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. As one whole movie, Kill Bill is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films of the first decade of the millennium.RecommendedA

Ice Cube has really evolved from being the most brutal member of gangsta rap group NWA, to a brutal actor and, now, to a light and funny man. Who knew?Since his rise to fame as an actor with Boys N The Hood in 1989, Cube has been in hit movies like Friday and The Barbershop and duds like Torque and XXX 2: The Next Level.Are We There Yet is his latest lightfare road comedy about a man named Nick who wants to prove to the woman, played by Nia Long, he's interested in that he can handle responsibilities by taking her two snot-nosed kids from Oregon to Toronto where she is conducting business just in time to celebrate New Year's with her in his brand new Navigator. The kids do almost everything annoying and disgusting that you can think of: throwing up in the car, locking Nick out and taking the car for a wild spin, and setting Nick's pride and joy on fire!The film is cute and tolerable considering that it borrows its ideas from past road comedies like Vacation, Planes Trains And Automobiles, and Road Trip. However, kids and even grown ups will laugh at how silly Ice Cube can really be!RecommendedB-

This is Matchbox Twenty's third installment after 1996's Yourself Or Someone Like You, and 2000's Mad Season. More Than You Think You Are is a fresh sounding musical extravaganza that is too good to be true. The albums opens up with hard rocking Feel, a good start. This is followed by the first single Disease, a song cowritten by Rob Thomas and Mick Jagger. (Santana, Jagger. Who's next, Rob? McCartney possibly!) Third track Bright Lights has got to be the highlight of the album, a chillingly beautiful tune with Rob's best vocal duty to date. Unwell is M20's finest ballad to date. Cold, All I Need and Hand Me Down are examples of Matchbox Twenty's talent put to test ending with a passing grade. The rest of tracks excluding the last are mediocre. The Difference is a powerful closer, not counting the hidden track.To sum up this album, it is a typical Matchbox Twenty offering. No new sounds, no experimentations. Just the good old sound of Matchbox Twenty. And there's no doubt, Rob Thomas is on his way to becoming a leading songwriter of his generation.RecommendedB+

The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places).Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well "not even exist at the school", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents.The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas.The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on.RecommendedA

The intriguing life story of the man who was born Steven, lived his life known as Cat and after an encounter with the truth transformed into Yusuf Islam is worth writing a book for or making a movie about. In the seventies, people around the world were falling in love or were already in love with the music and the charisma of this poetic young intelligent well-spoken well-behaved englishman. One album after another, Cat Stevens made an eternal mark in pop/rock history books. From the witty "Matthew And Son" through the charm of "Wild World" and the maturity of "Father And Son" Cat's music was diverse and grew more and more intellectual and serious.One will sit through this outrageous compilation of songs written and performed by this man during the years he was an energetic Pop music machine and just smile. How could you not when you hear the catchy 'The First Cut is The Deepest", the sentimental "Lady D'Arbanville", the touching "Morning Has Broken" and "The Wind", and the smart "Moonshadow"? His lovely masculine voice empowered by the delicate string arrangements and his own guitar compositions became the tone and the rhythm of the era. "I've Got A Thing About Seeing My Grandson Grow Old" is the only previously unreleased track on the album, sounding as crisp as it would have been it was released when the song was originaly recorded sometime in the 70's, it's a grand track with Cat speaking about settling down and living his life for his children and grandchildren.Cat Stevens is no longer that same pop hit single machine anymore. He's not even Cat Stevens anymore. He's discovered Islam (which means Submission To the One God of all prophets and all humanity in arabic), and he has now become a devoted Muslim, father and husband. His recent recordings under the name he's had for over 25 years now, Yusuf Islam, are wonderful and inspiring Islamic teachings from the life of Prophet Muhammed peace be upon him, to the teachings from the Holy Quran. I recommend you pick up one or more of those albums when you have the chance.But musically, this album is a must have. Even though I do think that many good Cat songs were left out such as "I Think I See The Light", and "If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out" I still love this album and recommend it to all.

Everybody was hoping for it. In 1995, it finally happened!That year, director Michael Mann (Ali) convinced the two strongest actors of our time Oscar winners Robert Deniro (Raging Bull) and Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman) to co-star in the intense action thriller Heat. Heat would become the stars' second shared credit in a movie together, the first being The Godfather Part 2, in which both actors did not appear together in any of the scenes, and Deniro won a supporting actor Oscar for.Pacino plays LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna, while Deniro plays heist master Neil McCauley. Hanna is aching to bust McCauley in the act, and McCauley knows Hanna's every move. Two of them are the flipside of one another. Hanna's got family problems, McCauley's got a love interest who thinks he's a salesman. Hanna is great at his job in putting crooks away, McCauley is great at his 'job' in stealing millions of dollars and getting away with it.We sit, watch and anticipate the moment that these two powerful men meet. When they do, it's for a cup of coffee in a restaurant, where each rival sets the other one straight. Neither will hesitate in killing the other if they ever cross each other or come face to face while in the line of duty, even if it will risk uncovering McCauley's true identity and losing the woman he loves.Director Mann takes a back seat and lets his star-studded cast which includes Val Kilmer (The Doors), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Jon Voight (Runaway Train), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith), and Ashley Judd (Kiss The Girls) lead us into one of the most memorable mindblowing movie experiences of the past 10 years! Deniro and Pacino each delivers an outstanding performance in a movie that perfectly teams them up.Bring on the Heat!RecommendedA+

Set in 1999 in the war-torn African country of Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond delivers an adventurous, action-packed, and tragic tale of what people will do for the most expensive rock on the planet, the diamond.Directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), and starring Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Dijimon Hounsou (Amistad), and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Blood Diamond is a satisfying but flawed thought-provoking film.The story revolves around three characters, the Souith African ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer, played with flair by Dicaprio, the African fisherman turned diamond miner Solomon Vandy, played brilliantly by Hounsou, and the TV reporter who is looking for a killer story about blood diamonds Maddy Bowen, played by Connelly. While mining for diamonds under force of the Armed Forces, Vandu finds a 10-carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison. In the meantime, rebels attack the village where his family live kidnapping his son Dia in the process and turning him into a child soldier. Archer knows he found the diamond he's been looking for and makes a deal with Vandy that if he helps him find it, he will get his family back and split the amount between the both of them. He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.Blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!RecommendedB-

2000's Warning was Green Day's least selling album since their best selling album Dookie. However, that doesn't mean that Warning is a bad album. It features some very catchy songs with infectious music. Minority, Waiting, and the title track, Warning, are the three tracks that were released as singles. The album's remaining tracks are a combination of signature Green Day: Fashion Victim, Deadbeat Holiday; with some promising new-ground venturing tunes: Blood Sex And Booze, the Beatles-esque Misery, Church On Sunday, the Dylan-esque Hold On, and the beautiful Macy's Day Parade, that all sum up the highlights on Warning.This album sounded cool when it was first released, and now with the release of Green Day's masterpiece American Idiot, it sounds even better.RecommendedA-

Al Pacino (Scarface) won his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 1992 when he starred in Scent Of A Woman, a movie directed by Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop) and co-starring Chris O'Donnell (Batman Forever).Pacino plays Lt. Colonel Frank Slade, a blind and retired military officer who spends thanksgiving weekend with his caretaker, a young and poor Oregon man named Charlie, played incredibly by O'Donnell, in New York City.Charlie goes to a rich boy's school, Baird, where he is held as a witness to a disciplinary issue revolving around an incident that humiliated the headmaster, who threatens expulsion for Charlie if he doesn't tell the board who the perpetrators were. On the other hand, the other witness is a rich man's kid, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), who eventually gets an easier treatment. Charlie decides to work over the thanksgiving vacation as a caretaker for Slade, whose family leave him to go out of town.Pacino's performance as Slade strikes gold. He's vicious and moody for a blind man, one who refuses to be held at the arm when walking, but he's also lonely, miserable and in need of a good time. Charlie accompanies Slade against his will to New York City where Slade has set an agenda that includes dining in a fancy restaurant, attending thanksgiving dinner at his estranged brother's house, dancing the tango with a beautiful woman, played by Gabrielle Anwar, driving a Ferrarri, getting laid, and finally blowing his brains out.What makes the movie engaging is the bond that we see gradually occuring between our grumpy old man and the sweet and sensitive young man, and how Slade stands up to the lonesome poor boy with a lot of integrity in the climactic disciplinary hearing scene.Scent Of A Woman is one of the best and most unforgettable motion pictures of the past 15 years.RecommendedA

The Beatles' self titled album from 1968, famously known as The White Album, is regarded as a rock classic; a genuine demonstration of how a powerful rock band can make music just for the sake of making it, and put all the songs from the recording sessions on the album without a care in the world. That, in a nutshell, explains why The White Album is a double album.The music on The White Album ranges from mellow: Lennon's tearful ode to his mother Julia, the magnificent Dear Prudence, and the bedtime lullaby Good Night, sung by Ringo, with it's wonderful string arrangement, and the 'revolutionary' Revolution 1 (a later version of the song featured as the b-side to Hey Jude is the most famous version for it's hard rocking vibe), McCartney's self-analyzing Blackbird, biographical Mother Nature's Son, and the dreamy Martha My Dear, and Harrison's beautiful While My Guitar Gently Weeps (which features Eric Clapton on guitar); hysterical: Lennon's odd but cool Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey, wierd but wonderful Happiness Is A Warm Gun, self and Beatles mocking Glass Onion, and adventurously bizarre Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, McCartney's fairy tale spagetti western Rocky Raccoon, bizarre Why Don't We Do It In The Road, and the 50's inspired Honey Pie, Harrison's blatant criticism of the upper class Piggies, and Ringo's joyful Don't Pass Me By; to the hard rocking: Lennon's bluesy Yer Blues, McCartney's vicious Helter Skelter, and poppy Back In The USSR.The White Album remains to be one of the best rock albums ever made.RecommendedA

The Beatles are the best rock band that ever was...and ever will be.The fab four's 1969 album Abbey Road, which was their last album released while they were still together (1970's Let It Be was released after The Beatles' official break up), is an outstanding collection of some of the band's greatest moments in rock history. It's flawless, geniune, and brilliant in every right.The list of songs includes one of John Lennon's best contributions to the Beatles back catalogue Come Together, George Harrison's irresistably beautiful Here Comes The Sun and Something, Paul McCartney's artistic vision on She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, and The End (which features the most positive lyric ever put on tape "...and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make"). The album also features some recording session bits and pieces put together to form a puzzle that is listenable as it is overwhelmingly enjoyable: Lennon's bluesy rocker I Want You (She's So Heavy), which stands alone as the most underrated Beatles rock jam ever, Mean Mr. Mustard, and Polythene Pam; Paul's 50's inspired Oh Darling!; Ringo's overlooked classic Octopus's Garden, and the essential and harmonious Lennon penned number Because.It's hard to point out the best Beatles record, but Abbey Road is easily considered a contender!RecommendedA

Cloak And Dagger is a sweet 80's family movie directed by Richard Franklin (Psycho II). The movie succeeds in being a kiddie suspense/thriller flick without seeming too sappy, like most children's movies are.The star of this classic flick is Henry Thomas, who played Elliot in Speilberg's E.T. Extra Terrestrial, as David Osborne, a young video game fan who has an imaginary friend, a Cloak And Dagger video game hero named Jack Flack, played by Dabney Coleman (9 To 5), and a real life friend named Kim, played by Christina Nigra (Twilight Zone: The Movie). David's father, also played by Coleman, doesn't spend time with him so he learns to depend on himself. However, his self dependency is about to wear out when his game antics turn real following an incident he witnesses when a game technician gets murdered by a couple of foreign spies but not before the victim hands him a copy of Cloak And Dagger that holds government secrets.Cloak And Dagger is one of those films that I've probably watched hundreds of times when I was a kid. It kind of scared the heck out of me when I was young (especially the scene when the lady exposes her hand that's missing some fingers). Even though the film has some excusable flaws (now that I'm adult, I realize these things!) because of it's appeal to children, Cloak And Dagger remains to be one of my childhood favorites!The film also stars Michael Murphy (Batman Returns), William Forsythe (The Devil's Rejects), and the old couple John Mcintire and Jeanette Nolan (previously appearing together in the 1960 horror classic Psycho).RecommendedB+

Music bands come and go. Some come and stay for a long time. Others come for a brief moment and leave afterwards never to be heard from again. The Cranberries can fall in both categories depending on what your point of view is on the 90's rock music scene or just this particular Irish band. One thing is for sure, &quot;No Need To Argue&quot; is a timeless work of art. The album mixes rock 'n roll with a nice cozy sentimental feel that would make any person weep. The album is brilliant really and I would have to be a biased reviewer here and say that I judge this album on my personal account on what it means to me personally. In other words, I love this album.From the beautiful hum and sing along tune 'Ode To My Family', to the deeply moving '21', 'The Icicle Melts', and 'Disappointment', the albums carries you along a flow of groundbreaking songs one track after another. To be honest, there isn't a bad track on 'No Need To Argue' even if I tried to find one. The music, the singing, and the lyrics all shape up together beautifully to form a masterpiece. Standout tracks, however, are 'Zombie' which remains to be one of The Cranberries most famous songs and one of the best songs written in the 90's; 'Ridiculous Thoughts' is the most haunting track on the album that plays with your ears and your senses for as long as it is, and its Dolores O Riordan's vocals that makes this song as well as all others an exciting listening; 'Dreaming My Dreams' is a beautiful love ballad and so is 'I Can't Be With You',; 'Ode To My Family' is as the titles states a beautiful ode to the closest people in your life.Since 1994, when this album was released, The Cranberries have failed to equal the power and originality of 'No Need To Argue' They probably won't ever even if they tried to but who would need to prove himself after giving an excellent example of what a music album should sound like?The Cranberries should enjoy what a successful album they put together here, and you should too!

Two years after the explosively successful 'No Need To Argue', Irish sweethearts The Cranberries released 'To The Faithful Departed' True to its title, the album pays tribute to casualities of war, dead singers, and just about anybody dear to somebody who had departed. This takes up the theme of most of the album: sad, emotional, and bittersweet. 'I Just Shot John Lennon' takes its title straight out of the mouth of the person who said it right after killing former Beatle Lennon, Mark Chapman. This track, like many others, is a dark and haunting song but moves by at a quick pace ending with the sound of gun shots. Yet on the other side, we get 'Hollywood', a Zombie-ish tune, turning Hollywood into a character in a gothic tale. 'Salvation' presents the dangers and ugliness of drug abuse. The highlight on 'To The Faithful Departed' has got to be 'When You're Gone' which is the soundtrack of the album's theme. The song can be related to just about anybody. And when Dolores croons the line '...but i miss you when you're gone...that is what I do...yeah yeah yea', it somehow makes up for most of the missing gaps and dullness of some of the other tracks on the album. Yet out of all the misery the album has to offer, we get one feel-good treat 'Free To Decide', a very good but typical Cranberries tune.Somehow most of the tracks here are mostly forgotten. Unlike 'No Need To Argue' which is a compilation of memorable tracks, 'To The Faithful Departed' is at best a mediocre offering with outstanding tracks; When You're Gone, Free To Decide, Salvation, songs that shouldn't be missed out on a greatest hits compilation.GoodC+

Reckless was one of the albums I remember buying myself on vinyl at the age of 7 when it was released in 1984.This is classic Bryan Adams to the core. His finest songs are here including 6 US Top 40 hits: the dark and elusive Run To You and One Night Love Affair, the sweet Number 1 hit ballad Heaven, the fan favorite and stadium rocker Somebody, the Tina Turner duet It's Only Love, and, my personal favorite, the nostalgic Summer Of '69 (which still sounds awesome blasting out of your car speakers 20 years on and counting).Bryan went on to write similar easy-listening rock tunes on his following albums, preserving his image as a 'kid' rocker in the process (hence 1996's 18 Til I Die). But nothing comes close to the glory of the summer...the summer of '84!RecommendedA-

Bad Boys is a solid prison drama starring Sean Penn (State Of Grace, Fast Times At Ridgemont High), Reni Santoni (Cobra), Ally Sheedy (The Breakfast Club), Alan Ruck (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Young Guns II), and Esai Morales (La Bamba).Penn plays Mick O'Brien, a menacing delinquent, who after a failed heist runs over a boy with his car, gets arrested and confined to a juvenile prison where he must deal with a couple of bullies. In the meantime, the brother of the boy he ran over and killed, a hispanic delinquent named Paco Moreno, played by Morales, is not satisfied enough; he wants to kill Mick, so he gets himself arrested, and follows him to the same prison for a bloody and relentless showdown.Bad Boys was released in 1983, only one year after Sean Penn's star making role as pothead Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Boys proved that Penn was more than just an onscreen goofball, but an actor who can take on characters of different dimensions.RecommendedA

Catch Me If You Can is the brilliant true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, the man who by his late teens had made a fortune from forging checks across the US and parts of Europe, was finally caught by FBI agent Carl Hanratty, and has been working for the FBI's Check Fraud unit since the late 60's. He also designed the checks that are circulated in the country on a daily basis.Catch Me is directed by Steven Speilberg (E.T. Extra Terrestrial) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator), Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump), Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Martin Sheen (Wall Street).The film follows Frank, played convincingly by DiCaprio, through his younger years when his parents divorce, and his father Frank Sr., played brilliantly by Walken, slides down the social ladder and how this all leads young Frank into a life as a fraudulant and smooth con artist. He becomes a co-pilot with PAN-AM airlines, a doctor in charge of the entire midnight shift, and a lawyer. Frank's mission is to take back all the money that his dad lost from the US government, and its the no-joke FBI agent Hanratty, played by Hanks in one of his best roles, whose hot on his tracks and always one step behind him.The movie is one of the most entertaining and funniest films I have seen in a while. Speilberg lets his movie flow smoothly and gives his actors enough freedom to let their sense of humor shine through.RecommendedA-

Rocky II is the best in the Rocky movie sequels.Released 3 years after the Oscar winning original Rocky, the movie takes place right after the exciting fight between our hero, Rocky, and the champion of the world Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers.The difference between Rocky in the first and Rocky here is that now Rocky has become famous for going the distance against the champ, recieves a nice chunk of cash for the fight which he spends on a new house and unnecessary clothes and items, and is getting offers to appear in commercials, which he does. However, the fact that he cannot read results in the rejection from the director of the advertisements, rejection from employers to hire him, and his failure to obtain an 'office job'. Rocky finds himself struggling to keep a job, especially after his now wife Adrian, played by Talia Shire, becomes pregnant. Rocky finally returns to work for Mickey, his trainer, in the gym where Rocky has now become 'royalty'.In the original Rocky, Rocky had to deal with being a nobody struggling to make a voice for himself, in Rocky II, he has to deal with swallowing his pride and keeping his head up despite the lack of a decent job and a humiliating ordeal of holding the bucket for rookie boxers to spit in. In the meantime, the equally proud Apollo will not put up with his fans' harrassments and accusations that the fight against Rocky was fixed and that he has lost his edge. Apollo determines to prove to the world that Rocky going the distance with him was a matter of chance and challenges Rocky to fight him a second time. The rest is history!Sylvester Stallone's script of Rocky II is equally powerful to that of Rocky, only the thrills are more vibrant in the original. All the actors who lit the screen in Rocky return to the sequel. Director John G. Avildsen, who earned an Oscar for his work on Rocky, does not return. It's none other than Stallone himself who directs this one. He will also go on to direct Rocky III and Rocky IV. Avildsen would return to the director's seat in Rocky V. Stallone does this movie justice.RecommendedA

Rocky 1976 is my all time number one favorite movie. This movie is the reason why Sylvester Stallone has been one of my all time favorite actors, despite his bad films! Stallone invented the story and wrote the screenplay for Rocky, making him a Hollywood genius.Everything about Rocky is outstanding. The directing, acting, and even the musical score by Bill Conti.It's a beautiful triumphant tale of a nobody who gets a shot at being a somebody. Our striving nobody, Rocky, is a club fighter who gets a lucky shot at the boxing championship title against the Muhammed Ali clone Apollo Creed, played by football player turned actor Carl Weathers. Then, there's another down on his luck character, Mickey, an old timer who never reached the big time and now can achieve his lifetime dream by training Rocky. This character Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith, is probably one of the most memorable personalities from Rocky. The movie's director, John G. Avildsen would later get inspirations from this secondary memorable character with Mr. Miyagi, and the movie as a whole with 1984's The Karate Kid. And behind the blood and guts of our main character is a wonderful and sensitive heart. The movie doesn't focus much on the fighting. In fact, the movie is all about Rocky's love to Adrian, played by Francis Ford Coppola's real life sister Talia Shire. And when Rocky goes the distance with the champion of the world in the most thrilling and astounding boxing scene in motion picture history, and loses due to the judges' votes, Rocky doesn't mind. He just stands there screaming out "Adrian!" to the reporters, and the whole world.On top of the strong drama, is the engaging music of Bill Conti, including the classic training song Gonna Fly Now!Rocky is definitely a movie for all ages and for all times.By far, the greatest movie experience.A+

I have not seen this film until recently. I never really cared for this film nor for its leading star, Mr. Russell Crowe. But I happened to be in Blockbuster and I passed by this DVD so I picked it up only to quench my curiosity over why it was named Best Picture. I was amazed at how wonderful 'A Beautiful Mind' turned out. Of course, I liked Ron Howard's past movies 'Apollo 13', 'Backdraft', 'Gung Ho', 'Cocoon', 'Splash' and 'Nightshift', so my expectations were particularly high.Russell Crowe amazed me as he delivered a very good performance as John Nash, a mentally disturbed mathematician genius at Princeton University. Jennifer Connelly reached her all time career peak as the woman Nash falls in love with and has to deal with her husbands problem. The movie is haunting, dark, funny at times, and very touching. I don't really know whether the movie dramatizes too much for movie purposes, but it sure unfolds very well. The makeup work is one of the highlights of the movie. Ed Harris is surprising in his role.In no way is 'A Beautiful Mind' boring nor is it dumb. It sparks excellent performances and a beautiful character-actor picture.Highly Recommended.A

The Champ is an astounding motion picture directed by Franco Zeffirelli with outstanding performances by Jon Voight, Faye Dunaway and the unbelievably convincing Ricky Schroder.The movie is the best intimate melodramatic tearjerker that I have ever seen. One view of this film will leave you with a lump in your throat and teary eyes, the next viewings will just leave you in plain tears. Yes, its that kind of movie that you'd see more than once and still feel engaged.Jon Voight plays former boxer Billy Flynn who is down on his luck raising his son TJ, played by Schroder, alone after his wife, played by Dunaway, left him and the boy and went on to marry a millionaire after he falls out of his life of boxing, doctor's orders. The movie brings you close to the lives of all three of these characters, you feel their pain, their grief, and their emptiness. Billy has turned to drinking to escape the pain of not being able to return to boxing to support a family. TJ does not know his mother since she left him when he was still an infant, and still sees his deadbeat father as a hero, calling him 'champ'. Faye Dunaway's character can't seem to cope with the fact that her son has grown up believing she is dead and can only take him as a friend after bumping into him at a horserace, the horse that 'champ' bought him was competing in this race. The story begins to unfold when the three characters enter each other's lives again.What's more beautiful about this movie is its musical score. The music is really another character in the film, and is quite breathtaking.Highly RecommendedA

Young Guns II completes the story of Billy The Kid from the original Young Guns released just two years before.Emilio Estevez reprises his role as the most wanted man in the wild west, William H. Bonney, a.k.a. Billy The Kid. Keifer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips also return as Doc Sturlock and Chavez respectively. Billy's group now has a few new members: Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh, played by Christian Slater (Heathers), Hendry William French, played by Alan Ruck (Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Tom O'Folliard, played By Balthazar Getty, and Pat Garrett, played by William Peterson. Young Guns II also stars James Coburn (Payback) and Viggo Mortensen (Lord Of The Rings trilogy).Guns II comes out as a more serious, and more fun, movie than its original. Billy has become a national phenomenon to the point where he can 'make people famous' by simply killing them. The law men have had enough of him and want him dead, so they hire his buddy Pat Garrett to pursue Billy and his gang and finish them all off.The movie features an excellent cast, catchy one liners, and an awesome soundtrack by Jon Bon Jovi including the song Blaze Of Glory.RecommendedB+

From the opening credits, that take place as you are zooming out of a garbage bin, to the very final blast of the movie, you are hypnotized into the world of its lead Edward Norton who flawlessly plays the down, dull, depressed and lonely insomniac. His disoriented thoughts leads you through a trail of helpless explorations in the world of dark dumbing depression. People with insomnia are bound to find bliss watching Norton carry out his hallucinative journey. He begins attending sessions for terminally diseased patients speaking out. One day, he meets this very well dressed, well spoken, and handsome man named Tyler Durden. He sells soap for a living. The two hit it off and literally hit it off every night in the streets. Other dysfunctionally miserable men of society join in and the two form an underground cult they call fight club.Okay, I'm not going to get into details as to what happens next...but the story's got so much hidden secrets. The movie will end leaving you in complete awe and you'd want to watch it again!The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed. And the stylish directing of David Fincher, the genius behind Se7en, brings back the noir-ish grizzly theme of his previous and present films back to your own viewing pleasure.This movie is highly recommended. This DVD is a must-have.

Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire) is one of Hollywood's prominent filmmakers. 1989's Say Anything... was Crowe's earliest hit movie and it still is the most beloved film by his fans.Say Anything stars John Cusack (Identity), Ione Skye (Four Rooms), Lili Taylor (Dogfight), and John Mahoney (Tin Men).It's a sweet romantic comedy about a popular high school nice guy Lloyd Dobbler, played remarkably by Cusack, who is madly in love with the most popular nice girl Diane Court, played by Skye. Dobbler takes her out, gives her driving lessons and his heart, helps her overcome a fear of flying, and they both fall in love. The one thing that gets in his way, however, is her protective and crooked father, played by Mahoney. As a result of her dad's insistence, she dumps him and gives him a pen for a present so he can write her. He becomes heart-broken and confides in his sister, played by real life sister Joan Cusack, and his friend, played by Taylor, and shows up in front of her house blasting her favorite song from his boom box, Peter Gabriel's outstanding song In Your Eyes.Say Anything features some classic moments in motion picture history (Cusack carrying a boom box has become so popular that it is currently being spoofed in the recently released comedy Date Movie). But, what makes Say Anything a delightful movie is Crowe's fascinating and honest script.RecommendedA

Sylvester Stallone is a coming of age Academy Award nominated Actor/Screenwriter, A legendary Action star, and a Hollywood heavy who has lasted over 25 yearsin the spotlight. His newest feature 'Eye See You', however, is a bad movie.First of all, it lacked any character development. The first scene has Stallone's character Fed Cop Jake Malloy buying a ring for his lovebird. That scene immediately takes you to Malloy with his cop buddies talking about a slasher who is killing cops. Then, one of the buddies gets home and gets killed, then Malloy goes home to his lovebird, and the next morning he gets a call about his buddy's death, he heads to the scene, gets a phonecall from the slasher as he's breaking into his house and killing his lovebird. All in the first 10-15 minutes! Where's the logic? Where the character background? Why is this happening? Nobody knows.Next, Malloy goes into a deep depression where he turns into an alcoholic and comits suicide. This behaviour ends Malloy up at a detox unit for troubled cops. And here is where the poorly rated fun begins. A snow blizzard hits the area, breaking any contact between the detox unit and the outside world. Malloy is stuck in detox with a dozen other cops and one of them is the slasher.By the end when you find out who the slasher is, you have no idea what brought him there, why he is killing cops, and why he has harrassed Malloy.???This movie is forgettable. Very poor script at worst. And Sly's acting is nowhere near Rocky status. Just the same old puppy eyed look on his face and the same snarly voice. The worst is where Stallone crys over his lovebird's death, it's more aching for the viewer to watch him overact than it is crying over the lover. That's how bad this movie is!I wonder where has Stallone of 1976 gone? Was it a strike of good luck that turned him into a star? Only the rest of his time will reveal that secret!Eye See You final words: don't See it unless you really feel like watching another Stallone movie.Not recommendedD+

Inside Man is a new film by acclaimed director Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing), and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Clive Owen (Sin City), Christopher Plummer (Syriana), and Jodie Foster (Flightplan). Inside Man would be the latest collaboration between Lee and Washington, after such films as 1992's Malcolm X, and 1998's He Got Game.Spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.Clive Owen plays bank robber Dalton, who leads a gang into a New York City bank one day, forces the hostages to wear the same clothes they are wearing including black hoodies and white masks. Washington plays troubled detective Keith Frazier, who is trying to negotiate with Dalton to let hostages go and find out what he wants. In the meantime, bank owner Arthur Case, played by Plummer, is afraid the robbers might uncover a secret document in one of the safe boxes in the bank, so he assigns a tough-as-nails problem solver named Madeline White, played by Foster, to try to strike a deal with the robbers. What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.Despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man. Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.RecommendedB

The 1980's music scene established synch pop as a modern sound. It also introduced rap and pop. The highlight of that era, however, was the low key, softer and more intelligent music of such bands as Journey, Air Supply, and of course, REO Speedwagon.This compilation of best hits by REO Speedwagon is a must-have for the fans. It's time you put away those long player records and cassettes and enjoy REO on compact disc!All the wonderful hits are here; possibly the best ballads ever written Can't Fight This Feeling, and Keep On Loving You; the cool charmers Roll With The Changes, Don't Let Him Go, Take It On The Run, and Keep Pushin'.The 80's cannot sound any sweeter than this.RecommendedB

Rocky (1976) is one of the best motion pictures of the century. It made boxing in the movies as exciting as a Muhammed Ali bout, and Sylvester Stallone the most famous movie star in the world.However, one of the most important aspects of the film that adds up the excitement and seems to get people pumped up and ready to go even today is the undeniably marvelous musical score by Bill Conti. The opening Fanfare is a small indication of how beautiful the music in Rocky is. Once you hear Going The Distance and remember Rocky pounding the heck out of the champion of the world Apollo Creed, it tends to bring you back to a memory of you jumping out of your seat with joy. As is with The Final Bell, when Rocky has already gone the distance and is surrounded by reporters and all he can say is &quot;Adrian!&quot;. You also remember the night before the fight when Rocky is startled by a huge poster of him facing the champ when you hear Alone In The Ring. Philadelphia Morning reminds you of the scene when he begins training by himself and struggling to climb the famous museum steps. Besides that, you get to listen to Sly's brother, Frank, croon Take You Back, Valentine's bluesy Reflections, and the insanely popular Gonna Fly Now, which has become the most famous Rocky theme out of the remaining sequel soundtracks to come.If you loved Rocky the movie, then you will love the soundtrack just as much.A

The Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul is a definite classic! The album contains some of the Beatles' most recognizable tunes.Each member contributes in some way to Rubber Soul, but it's McCartney and Lennon that take the lead: Paul's jamming Drive My Car, rocking I'm Looking Through You and You Won't See Me, and the soulful ballad Michelle, and John's experimental Norwegian Wood (the first song in which The Beatles would use the sitar, or Indian guitar), the irresistable Nowhere Man, the daring Girl, and the reflective In My Life. George contributes If I Needed Someone, which marks his first big break as singer/songwriter, and Think For Yourself, while Ringo gives his voice for the charming What Goes On.Overall, Rubber Soul is a delightful collection of early Beatles songs.RecommendedA-

The Beatles exploded into the music scene in 1962, but it wasn't until 1964 when they reached a phenomenal status by conquering America and the rest of the world.Help was released in the midst of Beatlemania, and became an instant success triggering a movie with the same title and nonstop touring for the fab four.Of course, The Beatles were destined for bigger and better things as the 60's came to a close, but the early decade was nothing short of fun. Help features the fast pop/rock flavor that the Beatles were known for during that time: John's cry for help Help!, early Bob Dylan impression on the brilliant You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, the classic Ticket To Ride, and the rockin' You're Going To Lose That Girl; Paul's classy The Night Before, solo debut Yesterday; and George's splendid I Need You.Help's teenybopper appeal and mega success was followed with more artistically sophisticated work by the Beatles starting with Rubber Soul and then Revolver before entering Pepper land. But for what it's worth, Help remains to be an excellent album that highlights a period in time when the Beatles were the biggest craze since Elvis Presley- just watch the movie for extra proof!RecommendedB+

The Beatles' 1964 album A Hard Day's Night not only is titled after a weird phrase once said by Ringo Starr, but it also symbolizes the fab four in their teenybopping, world conquering heyday long before the highly artistic and sophisticated efforts of Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper, and The White Album saw the light of day.The album came out right after The Beatles took over America with an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show; and to complement the success of the album, the movie with the same title was released to the craze of the young and the old!The title track, A Hard Day's Night, screams out pop/rock perfection, while songs like John's caressing I Should Have Known Better, and Paul's genuine All My Loving are examples of each member's individual pre-Sgt Pepper songwriting excellence. The album offers more Beatles classics: John's catchy If I Fell and Any Time At All, and Paul's overlooked gem Things We Said Today, and overplayed hit Can't Buy Me Love.RecommendedB+

John Lennon topped the US Singles chart for the first time in 1974 with the hit Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, a radio-friendly duet with Elton John.Following the success of the single came the album Walls And Bridges. Despite mixed reviews, the album contained some of the best songs and music Lennon had written throughout his entire career: the soulful Going Down On Love; the rhythmic What You Got (that sounds a lot like Stevie Wonder's Superstition); the slow and beautiful Old Dirt Road (co-written by Harry Nilsson); the dark rock tune Scared, which follows past songs like Isolation; a subliminal angry message to former agent Allen Klein in Steel In Glass (that uses the same musical pattern of How Do You Sleep); the affectionate ballad #9 Dream, also a song for Yoko; and what could possibly be the highlight on Walls And Bridges, the Dylanesque Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out), where Lennon expresses his feelings of depression and loneliness in such an honest way.Walls And Bridges may not be the best Lennon album, but it is definitely one of his standout contributions to rock history.RecommendedB+

I remember when I first heard of Take That. It was in a video for a song called "It Only Takes A Minute". They were still a brand new boy band in the footsteps of New Kids On The Block but they were british. Out of the five members, Robbie Williams stood out. He was the funniest, cheekiest member and he seemed to have more personality than the others. At the end of the video, there was Robbie pointing his finger up and crooning the line 'Just one minute...'. It was funny. 4 years later, Robbie left Take That and the future didn't seem too bright for the lad. He made several public appearances afterwards, one being as a host of the MTV Europe Awards in the fall of 1996. Prior to that Robbie had done a cover version of George Michael's Freedom. Not too impressing work there and more of a mockery of his boy band image. But Robbie struggled to change that. He hung out with Oasis, grew a goatie for a brief time, and began venturing into Rock music.Old Before I Die was the first non-pop song Robbie came out with that was an original song that he wrote along with an unknown, Guy Chambers. Highly influenced by Britain's biggest rock band, Oasis, Robbie wanted if not needed to get into the new mainstream since boy band music became a joke. After months of slacking, but not really slacking, Robbie returned with a full length album titled 'Life Thru A Lens' in September of 1997. I think i was the only guy who bought that CD at a Music store in downtown Beirut, Lebanon. And for some crazy reason, i felt like i really wanted to love this album since it felt weird just to hear Robbie on his own and see what he can prove. I was impressed, no...more, I was taken completely by every song on the CD!The opener struck a chord with me, 'Lazy Days' is a song about depression. A very Oasis-esque tune with the right lyrics. 'Life Thru A Lens' the title track is a fun tune about life in the public eye. 'Ego A Go-Go' is a personal attack from Robbie to his rival and former bandmate Gary Barlow, and manager. 'Angels' is the biggest ballad ever heard or written since Wonderwall. Not only did it spark the light of Robbie in the british conscience, but it had people take Robbie extremely seriously. This is a fine love song. The chorus, each verse, the music all speak for themselves. To this day, Robbie's best song. 'South Of The Border' is another rocker in the influencial direction of Oasis. 'Let Me Entertain You' can easily be viewed as Robbie's signature song. He is here to entertain us. He's good at it. He's been doing it since 1992, the difference is that he used to do it along with four other guys, now he's entertaining on his own but outweighing the entire Take That installment.'Killing Me' is the most open Robbie song. It's an essential song about Robbie most intimate feelings of insecurity and unhappiness. The depression he began having as a member of Take That and how he escaped it through pretending to be the joker of the group. Reminds you a lot of the way John Lennon was with the Beatles. In fact, Killing Me is in the same league as Isolation from Lennon's debut album 'Plastic Ono Band'. 'Clean' is another fun track where you hear Robbie rhyming 'I'm Clean' with 'Charlie Sheen' and talking about kicking his addictions to the evil substances. 'Baby Girl Window' is a touching song and a beautiful album closer.Robbie became much bigger, musically and artistically only a year later when he released I've Been Expecting You and finally getting praise in America.Highly Recommended.A

Paul McCartney's 1997 release, Flaming Pie, is one of the albums that I cherish. I played it on my CD player this morning after 3 or 4 years of it collecting dust and remembered how fascinating a number of songs were that I felt encouraged to sit down and write a review.Paul introduces the album as a matter of occasion, that how recording the Beatles' Anthology series reminded him of the pleasure and fun of making music which led him to the recording studio to make an album, exactly how The Beatles used to do it. And just like Paul states, the fun is sensed on the album.Flaming Pie opens up with The Song We Were Singing, a beautifully written accoustic ballad that blatantly refers to The Beatles' days. Somedays is most likely a sequel to Paul's thread of songs that have the word 'day' in their title (Yesterday, Another Day), the song is also one of the highlights on the album with its melodic guitar work and tearjerking lyrics. Paul also proves that he's still got plenty of melody left in him after all these years, just listen to the heavy-riffed The World Tonight, the awesome accoustic work on Little Willow and Calico Skies, the catchy Beatles-influenced Young Boy, the subtle poppiness of If You Wanna, the bluesy rock vibe of Used To Be Bad, which features Steve Miller on guitar, and the epical nature of Beautiful Night, an outstanding song that is undeniably pleasing to the ears, that features Ringo Starr on drums throughout and vocals near the end of the song.Flaming pie is a fun album, and most definitely Paul's most listenable album since his glory years in the 70's. Although the album does have its shortcomings, take for instance Souvenir, Great Day, and Heaven On A Sunday, which features Paul's son James on guitar, it shows that he can always come back to the songs he was singing to treat us with something hot like the Flaming Pie he delivers here!Track picks:The Song We Were SingingThe World TonightSomedaysYoung BoyLittle WillowBeautiful NightRecommendedB+

The Beatles hit the music scene in 1962, and by 1964 had conquered America and the world. The Beatles were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They were four energetic, exciting, and witty young men from Liverpool, England who made fast jingly guitar tunes that the world fell in love with overnight.The compilation covers the Beatles' greatest hits from 1962 til 1966, a period when the boys were considered more appealing to the teenyboppers and known for their straight-out pop tunes. The best of them are here: the sweet 'love' songs penned earlier on by Paul and John together: Love Me Do, Can't Buy Me Love, All My Loving, And I Love Her, and She Loves You; the earlier solo songwriting efforts of John and Paul: John's blatant cry for help Help!, mesmerizing Nowhere Man, experimental Norwegian Wood (the song that introduced the Indian sitar to the music world), rocking A Hard Day's Night, self reflective In My Life, Dylanesque You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, and naughty Girl; Paul's solo debut Yesterday, melodramatic Eleanor Rigby, rocking Drive My Car, beautiful Michelle, optimistic We Can Work It Out (which features John's memorable 'pessimistic' lyrics "life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend..."), and strange Paperback Writer.The following time period between 1967 til 1970 saw the fab four evolve into more experimental and sophisticated (and intoxicated) musical artists, with both George Harrison and Ringo Starr having songwriting credits of their own. But, it's difficult to appreciate the second half of the Beatles' legacy without enjoying the first half first!RecommendedA

There hasn't been a music group quite like The Beatles. For 8 years the fab four rose up the charts, started Beatle-mania, influenced the way the youth dressed, talked, and grew their hair, and launched a healthy contribution to rock n roll's history. This set of The Beatles greatest hits covers the years of experimentation and progressiveness in lyricism and music, 1967 to the year the band split up, 1970.The number one single Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane kicks off the compilation. Then, there are four tracks off of 1967's Grammy winning album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the title track along with Little Help From My Friends, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, and A Day In The Life. All You Need Is Love, one of my personal favorites, is also included and it sounds great. Other albums featured are Magical Mystery Tour in four tracks including Fool On The Hill and Hello Goodbye. From 1968's White Album we get Back In The USSR, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and Obladi Oblada. Abbey Road is represented with Come Together and Here Comes The Sun and from The Beatles final album Let it Be are the title track, Across The Universe and Long And Winding Road. One of the biggest highlights on the album, however, is Hey Jude, the bands biggest selling number one hit single.For a quick glimpse into The Beatles music and to understand what the big deal was with these four guys from Liverpool, England, this is definitely the album to have. Be sure you get this along with The Beatles 1962-1966.A

John Lennon's solo debut album, 1970's Plastic Ono Band, still stands as the best thing John Lennon had ever done in his short 10 year career as a solo artist due to his tragic assassination in 1980.Lennon was always known as the most outspoken Beatle. On Plastic Ono Band, John is in his most open and honest form, expressing his feelings of insecurity, loss, anger and frustration. Songs like Mother, which deals with his agony over his mother's death when he was at a young age and his hatred towards his father who left him, Isolation, which expresses John's despise of the public over their constant slander of himself and Yoko and how it led them both into isolation, Look At Me, which questions John's place in the world, and the short My Mummy's Dead, which again explores John's sadness over his mother's death, are some of John's best songs ever made. On the other hand, John is also optimistic on songs like Hold On, where he is telling himself, Yoko, and the world that everything will be alright, and Love, which quite simply defines what love really is in the simplest words. John also has his critical side, more in the territory of Bob Dylan, with songs like Working Class Hero, where he bluntly tells the true story of life in the real world. And of course, John cannot be mentioned without thinking straight out rock 'n roll which is delivered excellently on I Found Out and Well Well Well.RecommendedA

Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish and humorous action thriller featuring a star studded cast including Josh Hartnett (Sin City), Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Oscar winners Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Sir Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Lucy Liu (Kill Bill), and Stanley Tucci (Road To Perdition). The movie also features cameo appearances by Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing), and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown).The film focuses on a man named Slevin Kelevra, played by Hartnett, who is mistaken as a man named Nick Fisher by a pair of mob rivals, one a black man known as The Boss, played by Freeman, and the other a rabbi known as The Rabbi, played by Kingsley. The Boss's son had just been killed and he is sure that The Rabbi is behind it. So, The Boss assigns Nick, or Slevin, to kill The Rabbi's 'fairy' son to wipe off the debt of $96,000 that Nick owes him. The Rabbi, on the other hand, tells Slevin, or shall I say Nick again, that he owes him $33,000. The man working behind the scenes is a mysterious cold-blooded assassin known as Mr. Goodkat, played by Willis, who's planning a Kansas City Shuffle (you're not supposed to get that until you see the movie), while the private detective Brikowski, played by Tucci, is keeping an eye on that's happening and wondering who the heck Slevin really is.Without giving away the twist of events, the movie and its characters hold many secrets that eventually come to unfold at the end.I enjoyed Lucky Number Slevin a lot. The only flaw I'll point out to is the lack of background study on Bruce Willis's Mr. Goodkat character. Otherwise, this movie earns a Lucky Number four stars, or should I say flour stars?!RecommendedB+

Fun With Dick And Jane is a classic 70's comedy starring George Segal and Jane Fonda. Why did they have to remake it at all?The new version stars Jim Carrey as Dick and Tea Leoni as Jane. There are many similarities between the two versions but with different plot twists and situations. Instead of Dick getting fired from his top paying job, here he is laid off when his company falls broke. The ending also changes, the original had an excellent heist conclusion, here the ending bares no power at all and is comparably weak.Another big difference is that the original had many laughs, smart ones that is. The new version contains silly jokes, dull that is.My expectations of the movie were pretty high walking in, but I must say that since the original is one of my favorite comedies, I was disappointed with the outcome. Jim Carrey better follow this one up with an original comedy.Not really recommendedC-

Hall & Oates were one of the best pop/rock duos of the 80's. In fact, they are considered a signature look and sound of the early MTV craze. Along with Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, The Police, Peter Gabriel, and Huey Lewis & The News amongst others, Hall & Oates helped shape the nostalgic vibe that was to come out of the 80's and linger on for decades to come. However, the rocking couple first hit the scene in the late 60's/early 70's and slowly but surely made an unforgettable and successful career as singers and songwriters well into the 80's and to this very day.The duo's best songs are all here, from as early on as the soulful She's Gone, When The Morning Comes, the hit Sara Smile, and the incredible Rich Girl, to the typical 80's pop classics Maneater, Family Man, Method Of Modern Love, and You Make My Dreams, The Essential Hall & Oates will leave you craving for more. The compilation also includes all of the pair's famous tunes: the catchy hit singles Private Eyes, and I Can't Go For That (No Can Do), the elusive ballad One On One, the superb Say It Isn't So, and, one of my personal favorites, the chart-topping popsicle Out Of Touch. The album also features the brilliant cover You've Got That Lovin' Feelin', and the original Everytime You Go Away (the song later became a hit and memorable classic for Paul Young).If you're an 80's fan like I am, this double-disc compilation is definitely worth buying!RecommendedA-

I am not a big fan of Bruce Springsteen. I don't understand why people call him "the boss" anyways. But upon listening to his greatest hits compilation released in 1995, you can't help but fall in love with some of his songs that set the tone of the past 30 years.The compilation includes the classics Hungry Heart and The River from Bruce's earlier years; the 80's signature songs Dancing In The Dark, My Hometown, and Glory Days; the 90's rockin' ballad Human Touch, the elusive Secret Garden, and the Oscar winning Streets Of Philadelphia. The collection also includes brand new hits as of 1995 which features the dynamic Murder Incorporated.RecommendedB

What makes 'Tin Men' an entertaining movie mostly depends on its substance. It's a situational comedy. When two men, Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss, go at it over a car accident, that is just the beginning of a strife that never seems to end. Soon we have smashed car windows, eggs and potatoes, and a broken marriage. That's not all, we also get some very interesting dialogue; how about how ridiculous 'Bonanza' is, the mis-pleasures of picnics, hearing DeVito repeat the words 'Ease off!&quot;, expert Morangai dancing, and &quot;are they salesmen or hustlers?&quot; While all this is happening, we also get Fine Young Cannibals' classic 80's hit 'Good Thing'RecommendedB

It's quite obvious that over the last 8 years, oasis have produced some of the best music in recent memory and have established themselves as heroes of modern day rock n roll and have reached the height of success that such artists as the rolling stones, the police, led zeppelin, elton john, and the beatles have been graced with. Morning Glory remains to be the one album that defined the true essence of oasis, thanks to the songs' author and composer Noel Gallagher who stands today on the shoulder of giants. over the 8 years that have passed, however, their 1995 mega epic Morning Glory is still their best outing.The entire album is outrageous and it still sounds pure when i put it in my disc player and play it from start to finish. beginning with "Hello" and ending with a champagne supernova in the sky, one goes through 1000 different emotions in the duration of less than an hour. you jump and cheer and roll with "roll with it", you get butterflies in your stomach with "wonderwall", you remember your past and dare to look back in anger with "don't look back in anger", you feel a sudden rush, a pump of warm blood running through your veins with every tone of liam's voice singing "hey now", you dread on the bad pop music you've been hearing for ages and hope the song never ends when you hear "some might say", you sigh, sob or cry when you face the sun and "cast no shadow", you get all electric and shine and sing along happily to "she's electric", you then get another sudden rush like a shot of adrenaline that was just pumped into your veins and you walk to the sound of the favorite tune called "morning glory", and finally you get back to your senses and mellow out to a conclusion that seems at that moment long awaited, and it seems that it's coming to you faster than a cannonball but slowly walking down the hall of your mind with a "champagne supernova" in the sky. what art! what beauty! genuine. magnificent, spectacular, moving, slick, cool. you play it again and again and again and you never say stop!this is the best album of the nineties. oasis are to be recognized forever as kings of cool britannica, the honorable embassadors of the 90's generation rock n roll.whether the critics decide to keep on pounding them artistically or give em a break, Morning Glory will come out and shout out straight in their faces the words "today is the day that all the world will see". the world will still see and hope that today will last forever.

Forrest Gump is a mesmerizing and epical movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future), and starring Tom Hanks (Big) as Forrest, Sally Field (Mrs. Doubtfire) as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright Penn (State Of Grace) as Jenny, Gary Sinise (Ransom) as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Mykelti Williamson (Heat) as Bubba.Tom Hanks shines as the dim-witted southern simpleton named Forrest Gump who loves his country, his mother, and his only childhood friend Jenny, and that's about it.The film follows Forrest through an inspiring journey from his childhood in the 50's through his college years and Vietnam in the 60's, to his admirably successful shrimping business venture and settling down with a family which concludes in the early 80's. And throughout this incredible journey, Forrest has no clue how great a person he is and becomes.We get to share history as it unfolds with Forrest through the simple mind of Forrest himself. We get to meet different people who mark a significance in Forrest's life: his Vietnam buddy, an African American simpleton named Bubba, who constantly talks about shrimps and an interest in starting a shrimping business after the war, Forrest's superior officer in the war, Lt. Dan Taylor, who's saved by Forrest against his will and in the process loses both of his legs. On top of all that, we're amazed at how Forrest gets to meet three US presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; and musical icons Elvis Presley and John Lennon, and make history as he becomes a state football champion, a national war hero, and America's ambassador to China as a ping pong player.Forrest Gump will take you along on his thrilling, funny, and sometimes sad trip through his very simple but stunning life, and you will be unable to pull away from it, not even for a minute.Another important feature in the film is the soundtrack which covers each period with the songs that defined the era.RecommendedA

Pulp Fiction remains the most powerful movie of the past decade. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece recieves its much deserved special edition treatment with plenty of goodies. We have some behind the scenes look at the making of some of the sequences of Pulp Fiction, interviews with cast and crew, award ceremonies where Pulp Fiction was named winner, and some very interesting facts revolving around how the movie was made and what was used on screen. The movie also features a subtitled commentary on the film with important, if you are a big fan, information for each shot or scene.Put this big load of features aside, the movie itself is worth owning this DVD for. What can I not say about Pulp Fiction. It is a perfect 10 movie when it comes to scaling fairly. Tarantino put all of his heart, effort and witty talent on paper and then transformed the words into images that created this film. Whatever Tarantino made afterwards wouldn't matter, he will still be viewed as the modern day film revolution starter. Yes, Pulp Fiction was a revolutionary piece of work. The film mixes violence with humor in a way that I have not seen before. The dialogue is the highlight of Pulp Fiction, you will do more listening to Pulp Fiction than actually watching it. You can literally close your eyes and still enjoy Pulp Fiction. Tarantino uses imitations of real life conversations between his characters that makes you feel intimate with these people onscreen. Our leading gangsters Vincent Vega, played brilliantly by John Travolta, and Jules Winfield's, played even more brilliantly by Samuel Jackson, conversation about Amsterdam, the metric system and what they put on french fries in Holland instead of Ketchup (mayonnaise!) on their way to finish a kill is both hilarious as it seems realistic. The graphics are a combination of Tarantino now reknowned trademark; gangsters in black suits; with a touch of homage to his favorite films, whether its blaxploitation flicks; Samuel Jackson's hairdo; or Deliverance type thrillers; the infamous rape scene; or Samurai ninja flicks; the sword Bruce Willis uses to kill some very bad guys. Yet, you get the sense of Tarantino's inspirations with the soundtrack. The music that Tarantino produced himself and added to many scenes of his movie is a combination of R&amp;B; Al Green's Let's Stay Together; Funk; Kool And The Gang's Jungle Boogie; and western/country; counting Flowers On The Wall.This makes Pulp Fiction not just a movie but one big entertainment experience that stood, and still stands, the test of time.If you haven't been Pulp Fiction-ized yet, well its about time.This special edition is a must-haveA+

One must admit that Michael Jackson is one of the most profound artists of our time. He is one of the very few survivors of the 80's music scene, that's enough evidence of how important he is. He is a self proclaimed King Of Pop, child prodigy, artistic visionary, and a very controversial personality, his everchanging look says it all. In 1995, Michael celebrated almost 20 years as a solo artist with HIStory, an explosive musical masterpiece with two, not one, 15 track discs, one of which was a compilation of his greatest hits. In 1997, Michael celebrated the success of HIStory with HIStory In The Mix.Blood On The Dancefloor, the title track, is a groovy dance number. Michael at his best with a new style of lyric writing. The song tries to copy off the murder mystery theme of Smooth Criminal and the sassiness of Billie Jean, and somehow it works just fine! Morphine is an expiremental extraordinary track loaded with powerful guitar work from Slash. Superfly Sister is a low key groovy R&B; number that, in my opinion, is one of Michael's most underrated songs in his history. Ghosts and Are You Scary? are both taken from Michael's short feature, Ghosts. The songs are cool but copy too much off of past hit Thriller. It seems that Michael's obsession with ghouls and zombies haven't worn off since the Thriller video.The rest of the tracks are remixed numbers of HIStory tracks. Let me just say that the original versions of these songs are far far better than the remixed versions. That speaks for my review of the rest of the album. It should have never been made. I doubt that Michael is in need of remixing his songs for commercial appeal. He is a commercial on his own!Recommended for the five 'new' tracks.

The Wedding Singer is an extraordinary comedy set in the 80's. It's also the second pairing between director Frank Coraci and actor/comedian Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore), the other movie that joins the two is The Waterboy which was released the same year. The movie also stars Drew Barrymore (Never Been Kissed).Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a down-on-his-luck wedding singer who's dumped by his fiance on the day of their wedding. He lives in his sister's basement, and has a cross-dressing sidekick, played by Alexis Arquette who was the fourth guy in Bret's apartment who shoots and misses both John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction, who always sings Do You Really Want To Hurt Me by Culture Club. Barrymore plays Julia, a waitress at the banquet hall where Robbie sings, who's about to get married to a rich sleazeball named Glenn who dresses up like Don Johnson from Miami Vice and drives a Delorean from the Back To The Future movie. Robbie and Julia begin a friendship that seems so innocent but they slowly begin falling for one another. Robbie knows that Julia is the one for him and will do anything to get her even if it means that he should get some assistance from Billy Idol!Enjoy the fun of The Wedding Singer and relive the 80's with all its hairstyles, fashion, and tunes featuring The Police, The Thompson Twins, Hall And Oates, Billy Idol, and a hilarious rendition of Rapper's Delight by Sugarhill Gang performed by Ellen Albertini Dow. The movie also features songs performed by Sandler himself: the hilarious Somebody Kill Me, and the sweet ballad Grow Old With You.One of the best comedies of the 90's!RecommendedA-

Nighthawks is a suspense thriller starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), and Rutger Hauer (Sin City).This is one of Stallone's earliest action films (before the Rambo franchise), and one of his most underrated.New York City detectives Deke DaSilva, played by Stallone, and Matthew Fox, played by Williams, are hired to hunt down a world reknowned terrorist Wulfgar, played brilliantly and menacingly by Hauer, after he is nearly caught and undergoes an operation that changes his facial features. But he's not going to fool our heroes DaSilva and Fox as he escapes them around New York ending in a memorable climactic confrontation between DaSilva and Wulfgar.Nighthawks is a cool and gritty cop movie that is easily considered a cult classic with Stallone sporting a beard that makes him look a lot like Al Pacino in Serpico.RecommendedB

Saturday Night Fever is a classic 70's movie starring a young John Travolta (Pulp Fiction). Today, nearly 30 years after its release, both the movie and its leading star are still stunning!Travolta plays Tony Manero, a typical 70's misguided youth, who could care less about the future. He struts when he walks, works at a paint shop, gives his family whom he lives with a hard time, and screws around with his buddies. At night, he's the star at a local disco club. He dances like his life depends on it, and even his brother thinks that his dancing is amazing. Tony finds a private retreat from his turbulent life and confusion on the dancefloor, something that Night Fever captures to maximum excitement.Travolta earned his first of 2 Oscar nominations for his role as Manero, his second nomination would be 17 years later for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. But what makes Saturday Night Fever such a huge hit is the extraordinary music soundtrack by The Bee Gees, featuring the classic hits Staying Alive, Night Fever, More Than A Woman and How Deep Is Your Love?, the brilliant directing by John Badham (Short Circuit, The Hard Way), and, most of all, the true depiction of the faded out 70's disco generation with all their hair styles, attitude, and clothes (Travolta's white suit has become an important pop culture symbol).RecommendedA

Genesis is one of those bands that have stood the test of time and to everyone's amazement, they've survived despite going through 3 different lead vocalists over the past 30 years.Let me start by saying that if you're a fan of the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, you must avoid this compilation at all costs. Turn It On Again highlights the Phil Collins era of Genesis with all it's commericial radio appealing songs that still shake the airwaves today. However, the collection includes only a couple of Gabriel songs: I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) and the 1999 version of The Carpet Crawlers, while the most recent Genesis frontman Ray Wilson makes a special appearance on Congo. The rest is all Phil Collins with all his royal pop-ness: the dark epic Mama, the politically satirical Land Of Confusion, the groovy That's All, the hilarious I Can't Dance, the sweet ballads In Too Deep, Hold On My Heart, and Follow You Follow Me, the cool vibes of Misunderstanding and Invisible Touch, and, one of my personal favorites, No Son Of Mine, a song about a boy who ran away from home.RecommendedA-

Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) scored gold when, in 1982, he accepted the role of Medal of Honor awarded Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo who upon arriving back home is greeted with the disgust and disrespect of his own people in the classic motion picture First Blood.It's not until Rambo passes through a small town in the heart of America and gets harrassed by the town's sherrif Teasle, played by Brian Dennehy, that he finally snaps. Rambo escapes the clutches of the town's law enforcement officers into the nearby forested mountains where he feels right at home considering that he was a green beret. The officers are in for a surprising all out war as Rambo takes them down one at a time and singlehandedly brings havoc to their tiny city that they call home. The only man who can possibly bring him in is his former trainer, Colonel Trautman, played brilliantly by the late Richard Crenna (the role was originally offered to Kirk Douglas but he eventually turned it down).First Blood is an extraordinary film that reveals how mistreated the veterans of the Vietnam war were. The film also reveals Stallone's action movie star abilities, something he would later be typecast with, and in addition to the Rocky role, the film gave Stallone his second most popular onscreen character as Rambo.First Blood also began a series of Rambo movies: 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part 2, and 1987's Rambo 3, but neither sequel came close to the brilliance of the original.RecommendedA-

Red Hot Chili Pepper's 1999 effort Californication is one of the band's best 3 albums, the others being 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magic and 2006's Stadium Arcadium, to date.Reteamed with guitarist John Frusciante, who has proven to be the force behind the band's musical genius, the Peppers, consisting of vocalist Anthony Keidis, bassist Flea, and drummer Chad Smith, deliver some of the best songs on their catalogue: the exciting album opener Around The World, the wonderfully written first single Scar Tissue (featuring one of Frusciante's best solos), the mesmerizing Otherside, the funky Get On Top, the awesome ode to their home state Californication, the hard rocking Easily, the experimental Parallel Universe and Right On Time, and the ear tingling album closing Road Trippin'.Although the album has its fillers and flaws, Californication is an extraordinary rock album and quite possibly one of the best albums of the past 10 years.Track Picks:Around The WorldScar TissueOthersideCalifornicationEasilyRight On TimeRecommendedB

Antwone Fisher tells the real life story of the title character. A young black navy seaman faces his tough and miserable past with the help of a caring navy psychologist and then sets out to change his situation by confronting his inner struggles and finding the love of the family that he never knew.The film is beyond brilliant. Denzel Washington, hot off of his Oscar winning performance in Training Day, scores big with Antwone Fisher. He not only stars as the psychologist, but directs this flawless drama in his first ever debut in the director's chair. Derek Luke, a name that is destined to shine in years to come, portrays Fisher with such conviction that he successfully steals the show in the scenes he's in with Denzel.The film is very heartfelt. It will bring tears to your eyes.A very recommended movie.A+

In the early 90's, the New Kids On The Block split up and they were replaced by a much more sophisticated, and more talented group of boys named Take That. They were from Manchester, England and they loved to party. From 1992 until 1995, Take That was the name that every teenager and every teenybopper knew. They were huge. They made 8 number one hit singles in the UK and three number one hit albums. This greatest hits compilation was their last number one album released in February of 1996, the time when Take That called it quits.The compilation features all the singles from the very first to the very last. The highlights here are no secret, Back For Good has got to be one of the finest songs ever written. The song's got melody, a catchy chorus and beautiful harmony. It was Take That's biggest song released and their breakthrough hit in America. Pray and Relight My Fire, both number ones, are bubblegum pop classics, Babe, another number one, is a genuine soap opera turned into a song type. While Love Ain't Here Anymore tends to lean more towards the rhythm and blues section. A Million Love Songs competes with Back For Good for the favorite Take That love ballad, and the boyish voice of Robbie Williams (a young man back then) empowers the groovy chart topper Everything Changes. Why Can't I Wake Up With You, It Only Takes A Minute, and Could It Be Magic add a nice tasty flavor to the theme of album's high energy pop sound. And if that's not enough for you, the extraordinary number one hit cover version of The BeeGees' How Deep Is Your Love tops it all up giving the entire album a very good opening.Of course after the band disbanded, there was nothing much coming out of the members except maybe for the development of superstardom for Robbie Williams and a fall from grace for Gary Barlow who is least heard of nowadays but still making music.The majority of the songs are written solely by Gary. One track, Babe, is co-written by Mark, and another, Sure, is co-written by Robbie.How ever long it might take Take That to possibly reunite, if never, the world will Never Forget what a huge impact they were in the music industry back in those glorious years in the 90's.This compilation is a must-have.

1987's science fiction/action cop movie Robocop is one of the most memorable films of its genre. The movie is directed by the controversial Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct), and stars Peter Weller (Mighty Aphrodite), Nancy Allen (Blow Out), Ronny Cox (Beverly Hills Cop), Kurtwood Smith (Rambo III), Dan O'Herlihy (The Rat Pack), and Miguel Ferrer (Traffic).Weller plays Alex Murphy, a futuristic Detroit police officer, who partners up with Ann Lewis, played by Allen, and pursues a gang of eccentric thieving thugs led by Clarence Boddiker, played brilliantly by Smith. The thugs manage to gang up on him before shooting him to death. However, Detroit Police's managing firm OCP (Omni-Consumer Products), is conducting a technologically advanced project where they will build a cyborg that'll ultimately become the cure for the cancer called crime in the city. Murphy's deceased body and brain are recruited by OCP, and he is soon resurrected as Robocop, a half human, half robot that is programmed to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. Robocop soon gets in touch with his human side, and goes out in pursuit of his killers only to find out that they have connections to one of the senior executives at the company that produced him.What's remarkable about Robocop is the director's creative vision of what a future crime-ridden Detroit looks like. He successfully adds satire (the quirky TV commercials, ridiculous comedy shows, and even more ridiculous headline news) to the combination of gruesome violence and all-out chaos. Also, the musical theme, composed by Basil Poledouris (Conan The Barbarian) is astonishing.All in all, Robocop kills, thrills and ends up saving the day, a typical superhero who's definitely not for children.RecommendedA

Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle is a laugh-out-loud comedy starring two brand new faces on the big screen, and they're both originally Asian: Kal Penn plays the Indian Kumar, and John Cho plays the Korean Harold.Harold is an uptight company employee who is used by his 'white' co-workers to finish their work because he doesn't say much. Kumar is an outgoing genius in the medical field, but does not want to pursue a career as a doctor just because his father and brother, and every other typecasted Indian, are doctors. The one thing these two guys have in common besides living in the same apartment is their love of smoking weed.On one particular night in which the movie takes place, they both get the munchies after a 'joint' session as they begin craving for White Castle after watching the commercial on TV. And that's where the real fun begins. Harold and Kumar face one obstacle after another on their way to the restaurant including a raccoon, a cheetah, a group of palookas who keep on bullying them, a stoned Neil Patrick Harris stealing their car, a long haired freak and his sexy wife, and the cops.Harold and Kumar are the Cheech and Chong of our time. With that said, be sure to see more Harold And Kumar films in the near future, something I'll be waiting for impatiently.RecommendedB+

Many seem to disregard boy band pop as empty, lame, ill-crafted, and a sign of disrespect to real music. But in the mid-90's, a boy band from England changed that perspective. The band was called Take That and within 4 years, they were able of taking boy band pop to a new level. First of all, the band wrote most of the material themselves. Second and last, the music is mostly made of real instruments. Just listen to the dazzling UK number one and Billboard top ten hit single Back For Good and you will know what I mean. This song is beyond any description for its versatile extraordinary lyrics that fall in the right place, the accoustic guitar ringing throughtout the whole song, and the beautiful backing harmony vocals of the entire band. Gary Barlow, the band's favorite lead singer and songwriter, has got to be one of the least appreciated songwriters in pop history. Back For Good is one of the best songs ever written. The beauty that Back For Good offers is repeated many times on Nobody Else, the delightful title track Nobody Else, the pleasant Holding Back The Tears, and the tearjerker The Day After Tomorrow featuring Mark Owen on vocals. But with the serious side of Take That comes the let's-get-down-and-party typical boy band pop side also. The energetic dance vibe flows on with such tracks as the UK number one hit Sure, a song co-written by Gary, Mark and future pop phenomenon Robbie Williams, and the songs Hanging Onto Your love, Every Guy and Lady Tonight. The highlight of the album, however, is Never Forget. Take That's last single released as a five piece band, Robbie Williams quit the group around the same time this number one single hit the airwaves in the UK. The song, despite being written solely by Gary, is a group effort when it comes to vocal duty. The lisping voice of Howard Donald, the engaging snarls of Robbie, and the whiny tone of Mark along with a hard hitting chorus feauring an entire choir and an opening with singing children. "We've come a long way...but we're not too sure where we've been" sings Howard in the opening verse of the song, and goes on by saying "There's a road going down the other side of this hill" It's pretty ironic that the remaining four members of Take That called it quits just 6 months after this song was released. The good thing is that they didn't have to go through going down any hills, they quit while they were still on top. This song defines the success and fame that Take That had been going through for the past 3 years before this classic.Nobody Else is a good example of the wonders that boy bands can make musically if they grew some guts and had some 'real' talent. It is the band's third and last full length studio recorded album released and their best. Take That is the only boy band that I regard as artists. American boy bands don't amount to Take That's worst songs, if they have any!I recommend picking up their Greatest Hits album, released in February 1996 to commemorate their breakup, before purchasing this one.

The Police are without a doubt one of the best rock bands of all time. The magnitude of their success is on the same ladder that The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Doors climbed before them, only to different heights.Today, The Police is associated directly to Sting, their frontman, main songwriter, lead vocalist, and bassist. People forget, however, that when Sting was with The Police he had a different musical direction as he has now. That's only because Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland were behind him at all time. So if you think that Sting is a bit too soft nowadays, you should only wish they reunite really soon!The Greatest Hits compilation features all the hit singles that made The Police a household name: the hard hitting punk-ish tunes Roxanne, Can't Stand Losing You and Message In A Bottle, the dark and elusive Wrapped Around Your Finger, Invisible Sun and King Of Pain, the song with the most famous bass line and lyrics Every Breath You Take, the modern urban tale of teacher misconduct Don't Stand So Close To Me in its two versions (the 1986 version is better), the delightful ballad Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, and the gibberish baby talk of De Do Do Do De Da Da Da.Highly recommendedA

Phil Collins has always been one of my favorite musical artists. When this album was released and True Colors hit the airwaves, it showed how remarkable this man's journey through stardom over the past 20 years was.Hits includes the songs that made Phil what he is; the slick tune with the drum solo In The Air Tonight; the best ballad ever written Against All Odds; the sentimental and dedicative Another Day In Paradise; the chilling I Wish It Would Rain Down; the fun pop grips of Easy Lover and You Can't Hurry Love; the groovy One More Night; and the incredible Take Me Home.However, many songs were left out; I Don't Care Anymore, Don't Lose My Number, Do You Remember?, Everyday, It's In Your Eyes, and my favorite Find A Way To My Heart from But Seriously.Still, the songs offered on Hits are worth having this album available to you...seriously!RecommendedB+

In the late 70's, one of the most famous pop stars of that time, Cat Stevens, annouced he was leaving the entire music industry to dedicate his life and loyalty to God almighty to serve and worship the one true creator of us all. This was a major step for Stevens as much as it was a surprise to his millions of fans and the entire world altogether. Stevens decalred his full submission to God almighty and therefore became a Muslim.(The word 'muslim' means: one who submits or surrenders self to God) Cat Stevens later changed his name to Yusuf Islam and he has since been a big part of the Muslim community in England as well as a spokesperson worldwide. After years of not looking back a slight bit on his long gone music career, Yusuf returned with a new recording company, Mountain of Light, and a new approach. He no longer plays guitar, neither are there the sounds of bass nor heavy drums. All there is is a voice and a simple form of percussion and a message to convey. 'Life of The Last Prophet' is one of many of his recordings that puts the spotlight on the life of prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him, the last messenger of God to the world. Yusuf's soothing voice narrating the story of the prophet, from his birth to his upbringing on the hands of his grandfather then uncle, to his first marriage to Khadija, may God be pleased with her, to the first message revealed to him from God by angel Gabriel, followed by his conveying of the message from God that there is only one God worthy of worship and that he was the messenger of God, and his warning of judgment day and his warning to the people of all times and all places that helfire is home to those who do not believe in God and those who choose to be astray rather than to be righteous. It's a wonder how Yusuf Islam speaks the language of Arabic as fluently as his English. It's also pleasing to my ears to hear him sing the famous 'Tala'al-badru Alayhna' in both languages and the beautiful 'Muhammed Al Mustafa' peace be upon him. God bless Yusuf Islam and build him an empire in paradise for his efforts and his 'da'wah' - his calling to the religion of God, Islam. Of course the life of the prophet then continues taking you through the migration the prophet made from Mecca to Yathrib, later known as Medina. The battle of Badr is also mentioned when the small number of Muslims fought and defeated the bigger number of the infidels of Qureish with the victory of God on their side. Then the night journey to Jerusalem where the prophet peace be upon him was elevated to the seventh heaven and there, the five prayers were commanded by God almighty, then the return to Mecca with almost 10,000 Muslims and the smashing of the idols around the house that Abraham peace be upon him built many years ago, the first house built for people to come to as commanded by God almighty, the Kaaba (or in english: the cube shaped house) and finally the final pilgrimage where prophet Muhammed conveyed his last message to the people of the world and made God his witness that his mission to spread the message that God had sent him with was completed &amp;the last verse of the Quran revealed, and later the prophet's death at the age of 63. To this day, Prophet Muhammed is considered the most influential person to ever live. He was a man who completed the mission he was sent to do. Thankfully to God, today Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, and the prophet's message, God's religion, Islam is still the same message it was over 1400 years ago.May God bless Yusuf Islam and everyone at Mountain Of Light. Of course, my thanks or anybody else's thanks is nothing compared to the blessing of God that they seeked when they released this.I highly recommend 'Life Of The Last Prophet' to all Muslims and non-Muslims and may God guide them, the non-Muslims,to accepting the true religion of Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Jacob, David, Solomon, and all other prophets equally.A+

Following the success of Rocky, Sylvester Stallone stalled at the box office. He failed to ignite the screen and the audience with another big bang. The result was a series of Rocky films beginning with the underrated Rocky II in 1979, and Rocky III in 1982.If you haven't seen Rocky II yet, then there's no need for you to be reading this review. Of course, Rocky wins at the end of II turning Rocky into the champion of the world. Rocky III shows Rocky living the life of a made man, a rich celebrity on the cover of magazines, enjoying everything he didn't have when he was in Philly including a charity event where he fights Thunderlips, played by Hulk Hogan (Rocky III turned Hogan into the most famous WWF wrestler of all time).Enter Clubber Lang, played marvelously by Mr. T, an underdog fighter who, like Rocky in the original film, wants a shot at the title. After a public confrontation and Lang humiliating Adrian, an angry Rocky accepts the challenge.The problem that is about to face Rocky is the sudden death of Mickey during a spat between Lang and Rocky before the fight. Rocky loses. He also loses hope and the courage to step back into the ring. Not until a foe from the past, Apollo Creed, enters Rocky's life again, only this time not as an enemy but as a friend. It's the friendship between Rocky and Apollo that is the highlight of the movie and what makes it worthwhile. Apollo teaches Rocky skills he never had. He takes him back to the streets where Apollo started off and where Rocky is revered as a champ.I can go on and on with the story. So I will stop right here. Rocky III ends up being a good sequel, way better than Rocky IV, and the one thing that makes it great is Apollo Creed, who in my opinion is the lead character of Rocky III.The Rocky series did become stale after Rocky II, but the one sequel that stands as the best of the dreadfully commercial Rocky films is Rocky III.RecommendedB

It's become a familiar trend in Hollywood over the past few years that almost every successful hit TV series from the past is being remade into a motion picture, take Bewitched, and the upcoming Dallas. The producers of The Dukes Of Hazzard had an idea of turning the series into a farce comedy starring Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, American Pie's Stifler, Seann William Scott, and the world's most famous dumb blonde, Jessica Simpson, as the three Dukes: Luke, Bo and Daisy. They even got country singer Willie Nelson as uncle Jesse (no, not that guy from Full House) Duke.If you're into fast action and silly jokes, then you're in for a blast. If not, don't waste your time.Knoxville and Scott are the headlining pair of Dukes, Luke and Bo, who are determined to bring down Boss Hogg's, played by Burt Reynolds in his quirkiest role ever, ambition to turn the Duke boys farm into a coal mine. Daisy with her eye popping curvaceous body and very low cut jean shorts is there to lure all the big boys away from stopping the Dukes.The movie wasn't made to be taken seriously, and that's why I didn't. But I gave enough attention to laugh a few times, watch the famous General Lee fly in the air more than a couple times, and come to perfect conclusion that Knoxville and Scott are two of the goofiest and stupidest actors of our time, and Simpson is a very sexy babe (but, too bad she's dumb!).I was generous to give this movie 3 stars, simply because I've seen worse movies this year, for it's humor.Mildly recommendedC

Tuck Everlasting is a heart-warming book written by Natalie Babbitt.The story is about a young girl named Winnie Foster, the daughter of the wealthy Fosters who own Treegap Woods, the home of the secret magical spring. One day, while Winnie is on the run in the woods, she bumps into a young boy named Jesse Tuck drinking from the spring. The Tucks kidnap her only because they have lived secretly in the woods for more than 80 years. The Tucks turn out to be a band of immortals (people who never age and never die). They had reached that state because they drank from the spring years back. Winnie enjoys her stay with the Tucks and begins to fall in love with Jesse. However, trouble follows as a mysterious Man in a Yellow Suit, who knows about the the fountain of youth, Winnie, and the Tucks, offers the Fosters to lead them to where Winnie is in exchange for the entire Treegap Woods. I'll stop right here because I do not want to ruin the ending.The book explores the question of life and death and the idea of living forever. It is a children's fiction book with one element of fantasy (the magical spring water).Tuck Everlasting was a required read for my Teacher's Certification program at school. It was an interesting book that I enjoyed exploring. I do recommend you watch the 2002 movie version of the book starring Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, and Ben Kingsley.RecommendedB+

After two mega hit albums back to back in 1997 and 1998, Robbie Williams took a two year break from the recording studio and spent the time mainly on the road but returned with &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; in 2000.The album is not as great as the first two, but there are songs on this one that will either give you goose bumps or cause your speakers to blow and beg you to sing along.The opener 'Let Love Be Your Energy' is a masterpiece. Layers of guitars, a nice slice of psychedelia, the flavor of hippie love all over the lyrics and an Oasis-esque tune to go along with it and you've got yourself a powerhouse hit. 'Better Man' is a mature ballad, more mature than Angels believe it or not. Imagine Robbie sitting under a tree strumming a guitar and the words coming out spontaneously, Better Man is what you get, one of his best songs to date and that's for sure. 'Rock DJ' is a cheeky disco dance number with Robbie's first ever rap english style! 'Supreme' sounds like old school RnB mixed with that disco flavor. It's almost like a remix of 'I Will Survive', but on a Robbie Williams level, it's a good song. 'Kids' is what this album is all about, kicking back and having major fun! Robbie duets with Kylie Minogue paying homage to the generations of the youth and what you get is a superb pop song, possibly the best released in recent years. One of my personal favorites is the following track titled 'If It's Hurting You'. In the same theme of past tunes like 'Killing Me' and 'No Regrets', Robbie letting out his most intimate feelings of pain, it's songs like these that give juice to Robbie's albums. 'Singing For The Lonely' is an acoustic number with a touch of country. The rest of the tracks are just a stretch into Robbie's love of rock n roll. 'Forever Texas', and 'Knutsford City Limits' are prime examples but unlike his past rock numbers 'Strong', and 'Lazy Days' these will probably be forgotten in a short time. The album's closer 'The Road To Mandalay' sounds like a remake of some old song that I can't seem to remember but i can swear that that 'bum barumbumbum' part has been used before.Not exactly a masterpiece of an album but Robbie still hasn't lost his touch. There's a line in 'The Road To Mandalay' where Robbie sings &quot;everything I touched was golden...&quot; He still proves to be on the right track.RecommendedB+

...those who like this movie and those who don't. I happen to like this movie!What About Bob? is a film directed by Frank Oz (the man who gave the voice of the Cookie Monster, Grover and Bert from Sesame Street), and starring Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day) and Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, Tin Men). The film is a laugh-out-loud comedy about a psychiatrist's worst nightmare; a mental patient that just won't go away!Bill Murray remarkably plays the annoying yet very nice and gentle Bob Wiley, a man suffering from a personality disorder, who is refered to Dr. Leo Marvin, played by Dreyfuss, by his previous doctors who just couldn't handle him anymore. Bob is more than just a patient, he is the kind of guy who doesn't acknowledge the personal and private lives of his doctors and therefore sticks to them like 'crazy glue' and just won't go away! Dr Marvin is in for a big and unpleasant surprise after his first and last session with Bob right before he is to embark on a one month vacation with his family in Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. Bob follows him there and that's when the funniest doctor-patient relationship/fued begins.Murray gives a very funny performance in this one, getting on your nerves in most of the scenes he is in but in the meantime, causing the laughs to break out. However, the funniest thing about this movie is watching Dr Marvin slowly but surely being driven over the edge and then breaking out mad!RecommendedA

This album proves that the Verve are a force in today's rock 'n roll sound. Rock music with an incredible touch of sweet sentimental orchestrations. A very positive elevation in modern rock.The band's leader, Richard Ashcroft, who might have faced the sun and cast no shadow according to Noel Gallagher's famous "What The Story Morning Glory" track "Cast No Shadow" which was dedicated to Ashcroft, but going through his lyrics and compositions on this album, the only thing that casts is Richard's enthusiastic attempt to make a statement with songs that will everlastingly find a place in your mind."Urban Hymns" opens up with a "Bittersweet Symphony", which features music composed by The Rolling Stones' Mich Jagger and Keith Richards and words written by Richard. The song sounds as tender as fresh bread, with Richard pouring his heart out with one self confession after another, proclaiming that he is "a million different people from one day to the next" and that he "can't change". The video to this song explains exactly what its all about. This is a very uplifting introduction to one of the most talked about albums in recent years. 10/10"Sonnet" is the one that will give you goose bumps. A rich love ballad with all the right hooks, and all the right words. As the title reveals, this is a sonnet (a poem) of love from Richard to his girlfriend (or boyfriend!) 10/10"The Rolling People" is probably the grooviest track on the album and the grooviest song i have ever heard! Written by the band as a whole, the song is filled with cool psychedelia, great drum beats, some awesome guitar solos and strums...it's painful listening to this and not thinking that the Verve are able to do anything. 10/10"The Drugs Don't Work" is another tender ballad written by the genius himself, Ashcroft. The song opens up with a very warm accoustic guitar backed up by a gentle string arrangement, and then Richard sings the opening lines "All this talk of getting over, it's getting me down my love...like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown, this time i'm coming down", and from then on it gets better and better with every line and that chorus line strikes gold "Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse, but I know i'll see your face again" 10/10"Catching A Butterfly" is another psychedelic track with a nice tempo, great guitar loops, and an effective drum beat. Very Beatles-esque tune with some of the creepiest lyrics in rock, maybe creepy out of some heavy drug use! 9/10"Neon Wilderness" is an album filler. Written by the band's lead guitarist Nick McCabe, it sounds like a piece from Unfinished Music but worth its short time duration. Mostly instrumental. 7/10"Space And Time" is a cool rock tune written by Ashcroft. I wonder why they never released this one as a single. By this track, i bet you would have already fallen in love with The Verve. 8/10"Weeping Willow" is personally one of my favorites. Incredible use of those guitars man! And Richard sure as hell knows how to write some very moving and breath-taking lyrics. It sounds a lot like Oasis' "Columbia" from Definitely Maybe with Richard almost initiating the listener to see his way in the line that says "I hope you see like I see, i hope you feel like i feel" but it could also mean that he's talking with his lover to "stay beside me" which i would more agree with. 10/10"Lucky Man" is the most uplifting tune in the whole album. The one that will put a smile on your face while you air guitar to it walking around an empty room lip synching to every word (that's what i do!) Richard's genius flourishes with this particular track. And it also seems that he's shifted his mood upwards, a very noticeable change from the rest of his songs in "Urban Hymns". The best line in the song has to be "Happiness, more or less, its just a change in me, something in my liberty?" I love it! 10/10"One Day" is a confession of love from Richard once again to his anonymous lover. The drugs didn't work and the sonnet is out there, and now Richard is looking forward to a day when he and his lover "will dance again under fiery skies". A tender ballad that will find its way into your heart. 10/10"This Time" has Richard vowing that he will not regret his past but instead this time he will rise into the light. A cool album filler with cool guitar hooks. And i just love those backing harmony vocals. 8/10"Velvet Morning" is the next day's hangover. Richard talking more about life. That fuzzy microphone effect is a delight. 8/10"Come On" is a cool guitar fueled track. An encouragement to let the spirit move you and don't be counted out. Ends with a very angry Richard throwing the F word around like a madman, and you thought Liam Gallagher was all that bad? Another uplifting song by the lucky man himself and his band which appears to be cast underneath his shadow! 8/10Overall "Urban Hymns" is a classic. One of the best albums of the 90's. Right up there with Oasis, Nirvana and whoever else that rocked that decade.

I do not like Ben Affleck. It's not personal, its just that I think he is a lousy actor who relies on his looks than any other substance that, unfortunately, he does not have.Paycheck did not change my mind on Affleck. It did, however, change my mind on Uma Thurman who I thought was a decent actress. What is she doing in this movie anyways? Isn't she supposed to be killing Bill? Uma overacts in Paycheck and it is very obvious from her crying scenes and the scene where she is begging Ben Affleck to change his mind and run away with her near the end of the film. Even Paul Giammatti, who is a funny actor, is not funny in this movie.The story, however, is a rip-off of almost every single movie that was made in the same genre as this (action/adventure/sci-fi). You sense the clear resemblance of Terminator 2 in the whole idea of looking into the future and this big war erupting! Armageddon, in which Affleck also starred, is ripped off at the end of the movie where Affleck will risk his life to destroy the machine and have Thurman run for her life. Minority Report is also ripped off for the obvious reasons (the whole look into the future) In a nutshell, the story's been told a million times before.In the midst of this viewing chaos, one must admit that Paycheck succeeds in gluing the eyes to the screen. It is mildly entertaining especially the very last scene which is quite funny and surprising (I will not give it away!)But the overacting, Ben Affleck, the repeated story and plot (and even images) makes this Paycheck not worth cashing.Not recommendedD

Every once in a while, a movie comes along that lifts the spirits, gives you a smile, and makes going to the movies a great experience all over again.Cameron Crowe, of "Say Anything" fame, succeeds in bringing to life an everyday man struggling with everyday problems of the everyday common man. This particular common man is a sports agent, a very successful and, of course, rich agent who has a stunningly attractive fiance, athletes who depend on him to make fortunes, and friends who admirably and openly tell him "I love you, Jerry!". Jerry Maguire is his name. And he is played brilliantly by the ever-so-loved Tom Cruise. Despite all the love around him, however, Jerry does one mistake. It comes in the form of a mission statement where he challenges the business and dares to open up and speak out. The friends at the firm give him an expiration date, "about two weeks!", and it's up to his one time protegee Jay Mohr to tell him that he's fired in one of the most classic moments in movie history, sitting in a restaurant surrounded by a crowd of people (the scene where Tom Cruise stares down at his glass of water after Mohr blurts out 'I'm here to let you go' is as real as reality goes). Jerry is left struggling and failing to keep his clients except for one, the obnoxious Football player Rod Tidwell (played even more brilliantly by Cuba Gooding Jnr) His fiance leaves him labeling him a 'loser' and he finds himself battling to survive with the loudmouthed client and a single mother secretary, who quits the firm for him, who is the only left admirer of his 'memo'!Crowe, who writes and directs this movie, takes care of the characters' progress throughout the entirety of the movie. Jerry and the secretary (played by the sweet Renee Zellweger) slowly and passionately start to fall in love, and the relationship between Jerry and her only son grows from a goofy friendship into a father-son type of relation. But best of all is Jerry's one on one dialogue with Rod. Jerry can't stand the fact that he's stuck with Rod but faces the fact that he's his only hope left, and Rod still believes in Jerry and more or less becomes his right shoulder and gains him confidence. Like any other everyday man, Jerry still has people around telling him how great he is, even though he thinks very lowly of himself. This is the same theme throughout most of Crowes' films, especially "Say Anything" where John Cusack's character finds confidence through Lili Taylor.The movie is funny. With serious drama flowing thoughout. And there are catch phrases that people everywhere quote, most commonly "show me the money!"The DVD features two discs with loads of special features, deleted scenes, rehearsals, and the music video of Bruce Springsteen's 'Secret Garden'.Highly recommended!

Ocean's 11 was one of the best movies of 2001. When word was out that Ocean's 12 was in production, I was looking forward to seeing it. I finally did. I am not impressed.There are some funny moments in Ocean's 12 but unfortunately not enough to save the movie from falling flat on its face. The scene where Tess, played by Roberts, has to pose as Julia Roberts to get them into the museum to steal a valuable picture, this scene, although intended to be funny, doesn't quite break it. Even the cameo by Bruce Willis doesn't help. It seems that the actors had fun together making 12, but as I was watching them, I didn't feel a part of their jokes. The camera work, mostly handheld, gets quite annoying after a while, especially the quick panning across the room where the 12 are plotting the heist. Catherine Zeta Jones joins the cast this time around. I don't know whether it was her accent or just her that wasn't right in the picture.I realize that I've been negative with the review so far. But honestly, that's the only impression I got from the 2 hours or so that I spent in my seat waiting for this movie to be over.Very disappointing sequel. Hope they don't kill it further with Ocean's 13.D

John Lennon was the founder of the greatest pop/rock group that ever walked the earth, The Beatles. He was also a genuine personality with a charisma that was irresistable, a wit that was heartfelt, and an outspoken nature that influenced a generation. Lennon's music is the main topic on Lennon Legend, but one cannot mention Lennon's songs without bringing up all of the above.Songs like Imagine, Power To The People, Mind Games, and the powerful handraiser Instant Karma! are just a few of Lennon the revolutionary's signature songs that called for the rights and unity of the common man. Mother, Cold Turkey, and Jealous Guy, on the other hand, reveal Lennon the man and his vulnerability, the songs deal with his inner pains of losing his mother, kicking the habit, and hurting the ones he loved. Then, there's the side of Lennon the lover and his devotion to Yoko with songs like the mesmerizing Woman, which stands as one of the best love songs ever written, No.9 Dream, and the Ben E King cover of Stand By Me from his 1975 covers album Rock N Roll.The album also includes the Dylanesque Working Class Hero, the epical Happy Xmas (War Is Over), the sweet lullaby Beautiful Boy (written for young Sean Lennon), and the posthumous Nobody Told Me (the best social commentary song of the early 1980's).With the compilation released and many others before and after, Lennon's legend has and always will carry on.RecommendedA

Bullets Over Broadway is an extraordinary comedy directed by Woody Allen (Annie Hall) and starring a hilarious cast including John Cusack (Say Anything), Dianne Wiest (Footloose), Jennifer Tilly (Liar Liar), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Rob Reiner (Sleepless In Seattle), Jim Broadbent (Iris), Mary Louise Parker (The Client), and Jack Warden (Night And The City).Cusack plays David Shayne, a struggling 1920's playwright who finally wraps up a new script. He's able to convince a has-been actress Helen Sinclair, played by Wiest in her Oscar winning role, and a distinguished English actor Warner who has a huge appetite, played by Broadbent. The only way that David will be able to have his play hit broadway is if he allows a gangster's lover Olive, played by Tilly, who proves to be a terrible actress. Just when David thinks things are going bad, Olive's gangster bodyguard Cheech, played hysterically by Palminteri, interferes with David's script and demands to make changes, while Warner and Olive begin a secret affair.The film's comedic approach and Woody Allen's brilliant directing and screenplay makes Bullets Over Broadway a splendid film, and one of the best comedies of the past 15 years.RecommendedA

John Cusack (Grosse Pointe Blank), and Billy Bob Thornton (Bad Santa) are two of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. However, if the producers rated them based on this film, then I don't blame them. Ice Hrvest is supposed to be a black comedy. However, there are very few scenes to laugh to, and the film just drags on at a rate of someone walking on ice.Cusack and Thornton play two corrupt lawyers who've just stolen 2 million dollars from a gangster, played by Randy Quaid (Kingpin), and plan to make run with it before Christmas. Along for the wild ride is a club owner named Renata, played by Connie Nielsen. The movie takes a dive in for the worse as things don't go as planned and both men discover some secrets about each other.The movie was directed by Harold Ramis, the man who brought us Groundhog Day and Analyze This, two of the funniest films ever made. The Ice Harvest is not his best film.Mildly RecommendedC

Bryan Adams has always been one of the most interesting solo rockers. The first record I remember purchasing myself at the age of 7 was Bryan Adams' 1984 album Reckless. With that in mind, I feel no shame in saying that I am a fan of Bryan's music.His career might have recieved a renewed boost in the early 90's with the classic Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves ballad Everything I Do (I Do It For You), but the lyrics and music on 18 Til I Die still sounds as raw and electrifying as it did in the early to mid 80's. The title track says it all with lines like "someday I'll be 18 going on 55..." True to the lyric, Bryan doesn't seem to be growing any older as far as the record is concerned. He sings about things that only adolescents would dare sing about, take (I Wanna Be) Your Underwear for instance. However, Bryan delivers such charming rockers as The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You which ranks up there with Summer Of 69 and Cuts Like A Knife as one of his best rock songs, the groovy hit single Let's Make A Night To Remember, the uplifting Star, and the ballads You're Still Beautiful To Me, I'll Always Be Right There, and I Think About You.18 Til I Die signifies Bryan Adams' most commercially successful work over the past decade. It also symbolizes that there's no growing up completely for Bryan Adams, at least not for now, but why should he grow up?He'll be 18 til he dies alright!RecommendedB+

Pink Floyd's theatrical rock opera The Wall still sounds outstanding nearly 30 years after it was released.The album takes you into the mind of a rock star who loses every inch of whatever is left of his sanity, secludes himself from all the troubles of his own troubled little world, builds an imaginary wall in his mind made of all the people (his abusive schoolteachers, mother, and girlfriend) and events in his life (his dad dying in the war) that have seriously screwed him up, and dives head first into a dark world of TV, drugs, temptation, and utter craziness.The music on The Wall is brilliant. From the opening track In The Flesh? passing through the commerically successful Another Brick In The Wall, the silent primal screams of Mother and Goodbye Blue Sky, the elusive Nobody Home and Comfortably Numb, and the chaotic Run Like Hell all the way to the finale, the album sways and streaks to true rock perfection.The supplementary movie version of the album, Pink Floyd's The Wall, is a must see to truly appreciate and understand the storyline of one of the most remarkable rock albums of recent history.RecommendedA+

Vince Vaughn (Psycho) and Owen Wilson (Bottle Rocket) team up in the comedy Wedding Crashers which also stars Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye).The movie is not all that funny. In fact, I only giggled a few times at some of the jokes and one-liners, and laughed to myself at how bad and cliched the rest of the movie was.Vaughn and Wilson have got to be two of the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated actors working in movies today. Crashers portrays them both as players who crash weddings to pick up girls. Their game turns on them when they crash the wedding of the Secretary of Treasury's, played by Walken, daughter. They both hit on two other daughters of the Secretary and find themselves falling in love.As you can see, I didn't go into details nor did I use concise plot points to discuss Wedding Crashers because I find it all a waste of my good time.Wedding Crashers is one of the worst films of 2005.Not recommendedD

Green Day's solid 1997 release featuring the classic Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life), which is in my opinion one of the best songs of all time. This would be the first time Green Day would show they had something more to offer than fast 'punk' tunes and crazy, and sometimes perverted and sick, lyrics. Nimrod also features some inspiring moments like Hitchin' A Ride, Nice Guys Finish Last, the amazingly flattering Redundant, Worry Rock, and the cool rock jam Last Ride In. Most of the remaining songs on this 18 track album are forgettable excluding King For A Day and the album closer Prosthetic Head.Nimrod, in my opinion, is Green Day's least intact album but carrying some of their memorable work, especially the highlight Time Of Your Life, an indication of some great things to come later on for the California trio; hence, American Idiot.RecommendedB

Robocop returns to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law, in the 1990 sequel to the 1987 classic original.Peter Weller revives his role as the futuristic Detroit cop turned cyborg, as does Nancy Allen (Blow Out) as Ann Lewis, and Dan O'Herlihy as OCP's president. Onboard this time around is director Irvin Kershner (Star Wars Episode V: Empire Strikes Back) replacing Paul Verhoeven.Robocop is now battling a drug kingpin named Cain, played by Tom Noonan (Last Action Hero), who also leads the Nuke cult, a popular drug in the crime-ridden streets of Detroit. In the meantime, OCP is attempting to build a new cyborg to fight crime; the Old Man assigns a sexy young psychiatrist to overlook the project, who eventually recruits Cain as a new powerful cyborg, and turns a heavily damaged and destroyed Robocop into a wuss!The movie retrieves the quirkiness of the original, with all the fictional TV ads, headline news, and shows, along with the gruesome violence and all-out chaos. However, the violence is tuned down from the original. The movie's highlight moments is watching Robocop commenting on the moon looking wonderful, lecturing young thugs on morals, and pulling his gun on a man smoking in a crowded area.Robocop 2 is definitely not as good as Robocop, but, compared to the horrible Robocop 3 (in which Peter Weller does not star), is a worthwhile sequel.RecommendedB-

What's astonishing about The Masterplan is that it is not an original studio recorded album by Oasis. It is a compilation of their best b-sides voted in by fans. With that in mind, The Masterplan is better than the three albums that came after: 2000's Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, 2002's Heathen Chemistry, and 2005's Don't Believe The Truth.One must wonder what Noel Gallagher was thinking when he added most of these gems to an a-side single instead of releasing them on their own, because a lot of these songs could have easily been top 10 singles if they were taken more seriously. Songs like Acquiesce, a stadium anthem with Noel and Liam sharing lead vocals, Talk Tonight, Listen Up, Half The World Away, It's Good To Be Free, and The Masterplan, a classic rock epic, could have been massive number one hits on both sides of the Atlantic.The album does have its skippable tracks like Headshrinker but they are overshadowed with Noel's brilliant songwriting on Rockin' Chair, Going Nowhere and the amazing Stay Young.I'm sure most bands would kill to have one of these songs their own. It comes to show how powerful Oasis are despite their shortcomings.Highly recommendedA

Once upon a time there was a young man named Jimmy. His friends called him B Rabbit. He was white and lived in a trailer on 8 Mile in Detroit, the line that seperates white from black neighborhoods, with his mother. He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew. He had a hard labor job in a factory. He was sick of his life. He wanted to become a rapper. His break into the rap world could happen if he wins rap battles at a local club where he is seen as a failure. His life depends on that one shot. Will he take it?That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture. The supporting cast includes Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as Jimmy's helpless mother, Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's friend and coordinator of the rap battles at the club, and Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and local flirt.What struck me the most about 8 Mile is Eminem's performance. Usually, hip-hop and rap artists can't act if their lives depended on it, but Mr. Mathers surprises the audience with a virtual emotion, humor, and subtleness that carries the film well into the climactic scene at the end where Jimmy goes against the odds to prove to himself, his friends, family, and the world that he's not just another trailer dweller from around the corner.The movie features the Academy Award winning song Lose Yourself, co-written and sung by Eminem himself.RecommendedA-

The Assassination Of Richard Nixon was a movie that went unnoticed in 2004. However, it was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year.Based on actual events in 1974, Sean Penn plays Sam Bicke, a cross between Robert DeNiro's character Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver and Penn's character Sam Dawson from I Am Sam. Bicke is an average struggling working class man whose wife left him because he doesn't do what he says. Sam's life has been filled with pipe dreams that never came true because no bank would give him loans. He's also a very poor salesman who loses his job. His wife has custody of his kids who he only has time to play with outside their mother's house. Sam grows sick and outraged at the system he lives in, a system of lies and deceptions and blames it all on the biggest liar in the country, President Richard Nixon, and attempts to hijack a plane and fly it into the white house.The movie is disturbing but very sad. Penn's performance is captivating and extremely convincing. You will find yourself sympathetic towards Bicke, a man who lost everything and his sanity in some of the toughest times in US history.RecommendedA-

Will Smith and Michael Mann take on Muhammed Ali with maximum perfection. The movie never fails. It tells the story of the rise of the greatest athlete that ever lived into the boxing world, his victories in both the Rumble In The Jungle and Thrilla In Manilla, his funny confrontations with Howard Cosell, who is remarkably impersonated and portayed by Jon Voight, and his many wives, which Ali refers to as a &quot;weakness towards women&quot;.The only weakness about this DVD is the extra features segment...there are no features! I sure would have liked to see a behind the scenes segment, or an interview with Will or Ali himself with their thoughts regarding the movie. The music video by R Kelly would have also been nice to have here. But the film which is almost 3 hours is a great viewing experience.With one star off the rating for an empty DVD, Ali is the one of the strongest films out there today.I'd highly recommend the special edition DVD that I hope Columbia Pictures is planning to release soon.But until then, this DVD version is a must-have!

Vanilla Sky is directed by Cameron Crowe (Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) and stars Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Rain Man, Jerry Maguire), Cameron Diaz (The Mask, Gangs Of New York), and Penelope Cruz (Blow)Vanilla Sky is one of those movies that will take your head, spin it around a couple of a thousand times and drop it so hard you won't know what happened! With that in mind, don't expect to understand the plot to Sky from the first viewing. Give it some time and repeated viewing and once you understand exactly what happens, write a detailed review here on Amazon!The movie starts out normal with Cruise's character, a young, spoiled huge corporation inheritor and owner named David Aames waking up to his playboy get-what-I-want life. He wakes up the first time in a dream that reveals his fear of loneliness. Anybody with so much money and prestige cannot be alone, that's what we learn from the first ten minutes. David's life is also quite eccentric; he has a sex buddy, a singer named Julie Gianni played by Diaz but he takes her unseriously while he begins flirting and falling for the spanish companion of his best friend Brian, Jason Lee, Sofia played by Cruz. Gianni goes over the edge with David's carefree and neglectant behavior towards her true love for him, gives him a ride in her car and plunges to her death (or is it their death?)From this scene on, David finds himself stuck in one dream (or is it not) sequence to another. His fears of loneliness come true (or don't they?) as his face becomes deconstructed due to the near fatal crash, and he's on a drunken spree to try to bring back Sofia into his life while struggling to maintain his playboy-ish and prestigious image.The movie is nice to watch while Crowes' now brilliant script writing doesn't fail you with his charming dialogue, funny moments, and a string of classic rock tunes to the soundtrack, including the new song by Paul McCartney with the same title.The movie's special features include a shot by shot commentary by Cameron Crowe. I do recommend listening to him talk about the ending of the movie to help you get your final understanding of the movie in general.RecommendedB-

The BFG is a children's book written by Roald Dahl, who wrote such classics as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach, and illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book was published in 1982 and immediately became popular amongst children and adults. The book won the Federation of Children's Book Groups Award in 1982 (UK), and was named one of the "best books of the past 20 years" by the UK's Good Book Guide in 1997.The story is about an orphan girl named Sophie who, one night when she can't sleep, looks out her window to see a creepy looking giant blowing something into the windows where other children sleep. When the giant looks her right in the eye, Sophie jumps to her bed, and hides under her blanket only to be snatched by the giant and taken away to his home. It turns out that the scary giant is none other than the BFG, or the Big Friendly Giant, the only giant amongst the frightening human-eating giants who is a good giant, who satisfies his hunger on weird vegetables known as the snozzcumbers and drinks a delicious fizzy drink known as the frobscottle, which has bubbles that travel downwards that makes the drinker break wind instead of burp. The other giants are named The Fleshlumpeater, The Bonecruncher, The Manhugger, The Childchewer, The Meatdripper, The Gizzardgulper, The Maidmasher, The Bloodbottler, and The Butcher Boy. When Sophie asks the BFG about what he does at night, he reveals his secret of blowing bottled dreams, nice dreams, into the windows of children's bedrooms, something the other giants have no knowledge of. When he catches a nightmare, he destroys it so that nobody will ever have to experience it. Sophie and the BFG become friends, and team up to rid the Giant Country and the world from the evil giants. So, the BFG mixes a dream showing what the giants do, which in turn becomes the worst nightmare the BFG had ever encountered, and takes it to Buckingham Palace and blows it into the Queen's bedroom, and leaves Sophie on the windowsill, for the dream includes the knowledge that she would be there when the Queen wakes up. When the Queen awakens after the frightful dream, she believes Sophie's story, speaks to the BFG, and works along with Sophie and the BFG to eliminate the child-eating giants.The BFG is a character that the reader will automaticaly like. His unusual features, and nonsensical vocabulary, are both funny and very appealing to children as well as adults. Sophie is the young orphan girl who does an outstanding thing (saving the world from the evil giants), a theme that had been used by Dahl in other books like Matilda.The book was very easy to read, and extremely amusing. Dahl's style and imaginative BFG dialogue tends to make children laugh and attempt to imitate. The story may also give the children a sense of fear or suspense (the description of the evil giants and what they do). Of course, the best thing about The BFG is the theme of good versus evil. It also shows that not just because someone might look unusual or scary means that that someone or thing is evil. In other words, you can't judge others by what they look like or how they look, but you can judge them only by their actions; a very useful lesson of life for children.IMPORTANT NOTE: Some elements in the book may be offensive to some ethnic readers (Greeks, Turks amongst others).RecommendedA

Cape Fear is one of the best films of the 1990's.Directed by Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas), and starring his usual collaborator Robert Deniro (Goodfellas, Raging Bull), along with Nick Nolte (48 Hours), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Joe Don Baker (Fletch), and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers), the film is a remake of the 1962 original with the same title (the original Max Cady and Sam Bowden actors Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck make cameo appearances).Deniro plays Cady, a menacing ex-convict who upon his release from prison after serving 14 years begins stalking and taunting his former lawyer Bowden, played by Nolte, and his family, wife Leigh, played by Lange, and daughter Danielle, played by Lewis. The reason Max wants to bring terror upon Sam is because 14 years earler, Sam failed to present documents on Max that could have aquitted him from rape charges (Sam realized the grisliness of the crime and decided not to disclose the information).The film is brilliantly directed (Scorsese integrates his unique style perfectly). However, what makes Fear an extraordinary motion picture is its screenplay, and the star-studded cast (both Deniro and Lewis earned Oscar nominations- Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively - for their performances).RecommendedA-

From the opening chords and primal screams of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the closing strings and melancholy of Something In The Way, Seattle band Nirvana's 1991 modern classic Nevermind stands as the most important rock album of the past 2 decades. Upon its release, the album instantly boomed, making Nirvana the biggest band in the world, popularizing alternative rock, or what was later known as grunge rock (a Seattle sound combining heavy metal, punk and indie rock), paving way for many bands to rise up to the big time (e.g. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Bush, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, and Stone Temple Pilots), and labeling the band's frontman Kurt Cobain 'the voice of a generation'. The album became so huge in such a short time that, within a month or two, it kicked Michael Jackson's then Number 1 album Dangerous off the top of the Billboard Album chart.Nevermind is a mindblowing 12-track album featuring the band at their peak, and Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's late lead singer, songwriter and guitarist, at his most vulnerable and, ironically, best.Smells Like Teen Spirit, considered to be Nirvana's most popular song, is an ambitious rock 'n roll anthem marked for its memorable intro and rebelliously loud screaming guitars and vocals, Dave Grohl's vicious drumming, and some of the wierdest but sharp-as-nails lyrics. Other tracks worth mentioning for unique quality are Come As You Are, a gloomy bass-driven track with Cobain falsely admitting that he "don't have a gun," (note: Kurt shot himself to death in 1994), the mesmerizingly confusing Lithium which features some of the best guitar work on the entire album, the little ditty Polly, the bluesy On A Plain, the satirical, and one of my personal favorites, In Bloom, the cutting edge punk numbers Drain You and Stay Away, and the wonderfully written Something In The Way.RecommendedA

Eyes Wide Shut is a surreal movie directed by Stanley Kubrick (The Shining), and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Nicole Kidman (Batman Forever). This would be Kubrick's final movie completed before and released after his death in 1999.Eyes Wide Shut follows an upper class New York couple called the Harfords, played by then real life couple Cruise and Kidman. One night following some pot smoking, Alice Harford opens up and tells her husband about a near sex affair she once had with a naval officer. Even though Bill Harford had insisted that he never would feel jealous for her because of the trust she had earned in him, the thought and image of his wife having sex with another man boggles his mind. Over the course of the night, we accompany Bill on his trip of madness in the sensual underground world of New York. He meets his old med school dropout turned pianist buddy at a party early on the film who tells him about a mysterious orgy party that Bill eventually sneaks into wearing a cape and mask. What Bill is about to experience is the wildest and freakiest sexcapade any married man on the brink of insanity can undergo. He finds himself stuck in a web of mystery, confusion, erotica, and danger as a result.Kubrick's directing style never falls short. His use of long takes and dreamlike sequences that reminded me a lot of The Shining are elusive and powerful.RecommendedB

Apart from Thriller being the best selling album of all time, it is quite a good album for those who don't know yet!It's been nearly 21 years since Thriller was released. To be frankly honest, it doesn't feel that long. Michael Jackson is still around after all these years but in a different state than he was then. Despite all the controversy that surrounds his controversial character, he still manages to come through as an achieving artist thanks to this particular musical event. For the younger people today, this album was an event when your parents were your age.Thriller opens up with Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', a hyped up dance number that finishes off where Don't Stop Til You Get Enough left off. Baby Be Mine is a marvelous pop tune with cheerful lyrics and music, The Girl Is Mine reveals the heyday of the romance between Jackson and former Beatle Paul McCartney way before their fallout over the famous Beatle catalogue that Michael robbed from under Paul's hands. Put that aside, the song is a smart stab at pop extraordinaire. A duet that tops most others, with Paul and Michael taking turns in competing over their affection for one girl. Thriller, the title track, is one that everybody is familiar with thanks to that video where Michael transforms into a werewolf and then later into a zombie (a role that Michael has been obsessed with ever since). Billie Jean and Beat It, both highly publicized songs that got a lot of airplay and still do to this day, are fantastic. Billie Jean is pure R&amp;B at its best, while Beat It is pure rock at its most challenging (Beat It produced a memorable bassline and solo guitar) The best track, however, is Human Nature, a low key R&amp;B tune that shows Michael at his perfection in being a singer/songwriter. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) is another fun pop tune with the same style of Baby Be Mine, some memorable lyrics like 'Tendoroni you've got to be, spark my nature, sugar fly with me' and Janet Jackson on backing vocals way before her solo career began. Finally, Lady In My Life sets the last tone for the album, a pure R&amp;B ballad and a fantastic way to end a terrific album.The album, overall, seems low key. But the great choice of songs and the excellent production of Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson took this album to heights nobody imagined. When you do listen to Thriller, put all the hype on the side and listen to it for what it is. An very good album by Michael Jackson.

Napolean Dynamite is the sleeper hit of the year.A tale of an absurdly unpopular kid named Napolean Dynamite who lives around losers; his brother who spends his entire time on the internet chatting with his "girlfriend" who he has never met in person, his uncle who hasn't got over the loss of a football career 20 years past and shoots himself on camera throwing some lousy passes, his grandmother who goes on motorcycle ventures, a girl interest who has a pony tail on one side of her head, and a friend named Pedro who does not speak good english and goes out 'building' cakes for girls he wants to ask out to the dance and later runs for class president against the most popular blonde in the school. Pretty much, all the characters in Napolean are wierdos! But that's what makes them likable, and that's what makes the viewer not take the movie seriously and just laugh it away.However, the movie does end with a nice resolution for all the characters' deficiencies. The movie wraps with the class presidential campaign where Napolean gives his remarkable dance and blows everybody away!All the actors in the movie are unknown or just not famous. This movie will change that for most of them including John Heder, who plays Napolean.You know what, just watch this movie already, Gosh!!!B+

Cliffhanger is an action thriller directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), John Lithgow (Blow Out), Michael Rooker (JFK), and Janine Turner.The opening sequence of the movie is true to the movie's title. Stallone's character, Gabe Walker, hanging on a cliff of a mountain, and later, holding on tight to the hand of an unexperienced climber named Sarah as she's screaming and begging Gabe to save her life from the fall of death.Gabe leaves his rescue work behind after the fateful death of his buddy Hal Tucker's, played by Rooker, girlfriend because he couldn't save her. Gabe happens to be back in the mountainous region to make amends with his girl, played by Turner, when Eric Qualen, played brilliantly by Lithgow, and his gang of theives hijack a government plane filled with millions of dollars, and crash land in the snow covered mountains of Colorado losing the cases of money in the process. Gabe and Hal are the first to arrive at the scene of the crash for rescue work only to be kidnapped by the gang and used to find the money. Of course, Stallone gets away and plays a cat and mouse game with the gang up and down the mountains.Cliffhanger is spectacularly breathtaking, and one of Stallone's best action films. However, John Lithgow is the one who steals the show entirely with his menacing turn as the bad guy.RecommendedB

Fast Times is an 80's comedy directed by Amy Heckerling (Look Who's Talking), and starring Sean Penn (Mystic River), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Road To Perdition), Brian Backer (Moving Violations), Judge Reinhold (Beverly Hills Cop), Phoebe Cates (Bright Lights Big City), and Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian).The film chronicles the lives of ordinary American High School students: Jeff Spicoli, a pothead surfer dude, played by a scene-stealing side-splitting Penn; Mark Ratner, played by Backer, a nerdy theatre usher who's obsessing over the freshman named Stacy Hamilton, played by Leigh, who works across the mall at the pizza place; Linda Barrett, played by the gorgeous Cates, Stacy's best friend; Brad Hamilton, played by Reinhold, Stacy's older brother who's successful in his out-of-school career and is secretly infatuated with Linda; and Mr. Hand, played hilariously by Walston, the strict History teacher who must deal with Spicoli waltzing into his room late on a regular basis and ordering pizza to class, and who is convinced that all kids are on dope.Fast Times is a classic. What makes the movie so memorable, besides Sean Penn's awesomely funny performance, is Cameron Crowe's (Say Anything) script and the young cast who all went on to become famous actors (keep an eye out for cameos by Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, Anthony Edwards, Vincent Schiavelli, James Russo, and Heart guitarist and Crowe's future wife Nancy Wilson).RecommendedA

Metallica's 1991 self titled album, famously known as The Black Album, is one of the highlight albums of the 90's.This album was one of those that I listened to constantly when I was younger. Listening to the songs again today, I get this creepy nostalgic feeling that bring back many memories: the hard rocking Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and the outrageous Wherever I May Roam are just some elements of the heavy material that Metallica is known for presented here, but there's the surprising turn on The Unforgiven, an epic metal classic that sways and tingles as it switches from one chord to another (the song also produced a heartbreaking and memorable video as well), the wonderful ballad Nothing Else Matters which is, in my opinion, one of the best songs ever written.Metallica might have sold out in the late 90's with haircuts, designer clothes and the whole Napster incident, but somehow The Black Album still shines in its own dark way!RecommendedB+

Prayers of the Last Prophet is a very useful collection of some of the prophet Muhammed's, peace be upon him, daily prayers.The most notable prayers he would recite during the morning hours, afternoon hours, evening time and before sleep. Yusuf Islam presents these prayers in English and they are translated in Arabic.I recommend this CD to all Muslims as well as non-Muslims who want to learn about Islam and the humbleness and piety of the last messenger to humanity who was granted the last message from God almighty, peace be upon Muhammed.I highly suggest you obtain a copy of &quot;Life of the Last Prophet&quot; along with this one.A+

Liar Liar is a hysterical family-oriented comedy directed by Tom Shadyac (The Nutty Professor) and starring Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective).The name Jim Carrey alone is enough to explain how funny this movie is. In fact, Liar Liar is still one of his best comedies.Carrey plays Fletcher Reid, a conniving lawyer who wins every case simply because he masters the art of lying. His profession, however, gets in the way of his already crumbled family life: his divorced wife and 5 year old son Max. After promising Max that he will be at his birthday and breaking it, as usual, Max makes a wish that his dad doesn't lie for a whole day, and that's where the fun begins.Carrey uses his rubbery-face antics, body movements and screams to comic perfection. It gets to the point that you're laughing so hard, you overlook the fact that he is over-acting.RecommendedB

R.V. is a well done comedy directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family), and starring Robin Williams (Mrs. Doubtfire) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb And Dumber).Williams plays Bob Munro, a soda company executive, who's given an assignment from his threatening boss to meet with a possible merger in Boulder, Coloroda. The problem is that Bob had already promised his unloving family a trip to Hawaii. Bob decides to rent an RV and escort his disgruntled wife, and bratty and rebellious son and daughter, cross country for a couple of days on the road. Of course, the trip faces more than a few obstacles: some very disgusting incident involving fecal matter, a laptop looter, and the irritating but lovable singing Gornicke family, led by a hilarious Jeff Daniels.RV is not classic cinema in the making, but it's an enjoyable family comedy with a nice sense of humor, a delightful cast, and a plot similar to the classic Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's Vacation.R.V. is quite a trip!RecommendedB

Hostel is a horror produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill), directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), and starring Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power), and Derek Richardson (Dumb And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd).You've heard the story before, so I'll just recap: Hernandez and Richardson play two Americans who, while vacationing in Europe, get stuck in the most gruesome and terrifying experience one can ever imagine. Along with an Icelandic buddy they met during their trip, they are lured to a town right outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the girls will presumably give in to any guy who speaks with an American accent. They meet two attractive locals, and later find themselves chained in a horrifying chamber where men dressed up as surgeons pay to committ random acts of torture.Before watching Hostel, I was hesitant in forcing myself to watch a movie I knew would probably make me nauseous, but to be honest, it wasn't all that bad as they make it out to be.Even though I found Hostel a bit flawed, the idea of the movie is original, the execution is accurate with all the gore and disgust, and the act of revenge in the ending is refreshing...all within 94 minutes of running time.RecommendedB-

This collecton includes some of Kenny Loggins' memorable songs from the 70's, 80's and 90's. Lots of songs were left out, however. Love Will Follow, Swear Your Love, and Who's Right Who's Wrong (which features harmony vocals by Michael Jackson) are some of the songs that are not included. Of course, the core of Loggins' career came in the 80's with the string of movie hits. Most of the movie soundtrack hits that made Loggins a household name are here; Footloose and I'm Free (from the 1984 Kevin Bacon angst film Footloose), Danger Zone (from the Tom Cruise film Top Gun), I'm Alright (from the Bill Murray comedy Caddyshack), and Meet Me Half Way (from Sylvester Stallone's 1987 arm-wrestling flop Over The Top). Kenny's appearance on soundtracks in the 90's declined but succeeded with songs like For The First Time (from the 1996 George Clooney and Michelle Pheiffer comedy One Fine Day) and Your Heart Will Lead You Home (from the animated The Tigger Movie) Some movie songs were left out; Playing With The Boys (the second successful hit from Top Gun) and Double Or Nothing (a duet with Gladys Knight, from 1985's blockbuster Rocky IV), two songs that should have been included. All of these soundtrack songs are very good. And so are the non-soundtrack songs. The children's classic House On Pooh Corner from the days of Loggins and Messina is here and it sounds really good. Heart To Heart and Heartlight from 1982's High Adventure, two of my favorite tracks here, are excellent. The Steve Perry duet Don't Fight It is a cool rock number. From 1985's Vox Humana, No Lookin' Back sounds delightful, Forever is a beautiful ballad, and the title track Vox Humana is bubble gum pop at its best.RecommendedB-

One of the most gruesome and horrifying films of the past two years, Saw engages the viewers in random acts of torture.The movie stars Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Prince Of Tights) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), and the film's screenwriter Leigh Whannell.Elwes and Whannell wake up chained from their ankles in a broken restroom with a dead body lying down before their eyes with a cell phone in one hand and a gun in the other. It turns out that a psychopathic maniac known only as Jigsaw is testing their will to live only if they abide by some the most grotesque rules of the 'game'.Saw fared well at the box office. It also proved to be an entertaining modern day horror film that many people disregarded as being part of Hollywood's latest trend and fetish with trashy horror flicks.For its creativity, Saw is a must see!RecommendedB

Collin is a pathetic and screwed up big baby who is grown jealous of his father's affection towards Sullivan. He carries out the job of finishing Sullivan and his family succeeding in killing his wife, played by Leigh, and younger child. Both Michael and Michael Jr set out on a trip of high stake bank robberies to avenge the death of their other family members, attempting to pay off Al Capone's lieutenant, played by Tucci, to end their protection of the Rooney's. While they are on their crime spree, the cold-hearted killer creates a special bond with his son, and slowly redeems himself. In the meantime, Capone's lieutenant had already hired a spooky hitman named Maguire, played menacingly by Law, to puruse the Sullivans and finish them both. Sullivan realizes that he must do all he can so his son will never follow in his footsteps.Perdition is an awesome film, with incredible cinematography, a heart-warming storyline, and great performances by the entire cast.RecommendedA-

In the fall of 1993, the biggest band in the world at the time, Nirvana (made up of guitarist/singer,songwriter Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl), appeared for the first time in MTV's studios in New York to record what was to become the best and most memorable Unplugged edition in MTV's history.Nirvana were at the top of their game, with millions of albums sold worldwide, and millions more the number of fans. Kurt Cobain, the band's troubled frontman, was the 'voice of a generation'. He wrote and sang songs that struck a nerve with the youth's conscience, from feelings of confusion, hatred of the world, self doubt and anger. The band had emerged onto the scene with such a huge impact just a little more than 2 years earlier when Nevermind was released to critical and public acclaim. Despite the success, the band and especially Cobain expressed their despise of commerical media and the exploitation of rock music, which explains the reason why they did not include their breakthrough hit Smells Like Teen Spirit in the Unplugged session.During the entire session, Cobain can be seen crouching in his seat with his face pale, his hair greasy and let down on the sides of his face, his voice raspy, and his mood ranging between torn up and just plain bored. However, once the music kicks in, he sings and screams his heart out to a mesmerized crowd, while unintentionally making some humorous comments in between songs ("I gaurantee you I'll screw this one up..." he says before an outstanding cover version of David Bowie's The Man Who Sold The World). All of this can be heard on the album as the band play some of their best and underrated songs of their short career: the heartbreaking Dumb, the gloomy Come As You Are, the two-chord classic About A Girl, the elusive Something In The Way, the ditty Polly, the awesome All Apologies, and the twisted ballad Where Did You Sleep Last Night, not to mention the highlight of the evening, a version of David Bowie's The Man Who Sold The World, which is most definitely on the list of most downloaded songs on the Internet, and is way better than its original.Only 5 months after the recording of Unplugged, Kurt Cobain was found dead in his house due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. As a result, Nirvana, the most remarkable band of the era, was no more.Unplugged In New York captures the Seattle trio in their last session together as a group. It's a remarkable album, and quite possibly Nirvana's best compilation ever.RecommendedA

Kevin Bacon is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood. He's been in tons of high quality motion pictures including such classics as Footloose, Apollo 13, Murder In The First, A Few Good Men, Sleepers, and Mystic River.His latest feature, The Woodsman, is a dark tale of a former child molester, Walter, who is released on parole and returns to his old hometown to assimilate back into ordinary life. Even though the main character's situation doesn't cause any sympathy, but disgust, from the viewers, his ambition to become normal again and the struggles he has to endure to realize that goal makes the viewer want him to succeed. Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's real life wife, plays his co-worker who falls in love with him and, after knowing his past, supports him in regaining a clean social status. Walter also gets indirect help from a young girl who enjoys birdwatching by snapping out of his disease after realizing the disturbing and deep secrets that she has locked up inside.Whether the critics slam this picture in its entirety because of its subject matter or not, one thing remains true about this movie and that is it features Kevin Bacon in his most captivating performance to date. Oscar on the way for Bacon? Maybe not for this one, but soon down the line.RecommendedB

After the brilliant 1970 debut solo album Plastic Ono Band, John Lennon returned just a year later with his biggest and most popular album to date, Imagine.Unlike its predecessor, Imagine sounds more radio friendly, with strings sugarcoating almost each track giving it an all-round sweetness.The title track, Imagine, a song about peace, is Lennon's most famous song he has ever penned in his post-Beatles days. Jealous Guy is a mesmerizing song where John is apologizing to all those he had hurt in his lifetime. How?, a song about feeling frustrated, is an excellent example of John's ability to write better ballads than former bandmate Paul; this is also evident on the elusive Oh My Love, a song that John and Yoko gave birth to after they first fell in love with each other. John successfully brings back the social and political blitz of Plastic Ono Band on two vengeful tracks: the sharp-as-nails Richard Nixon and politician bashing Gimme Some Truth, and the bluesy anti-war anthem I Don't Want To Be A Soldier. And of course, no Lennon album would be complete without some straight-out rock 'n roll tunes, in this case It's So Hard and Crippled Inside do the job well.The album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic upon its release in late 1971. Today, Imagine is more than just a classic hit album, it's a significant moment in Lennon's legacy.RecommendedA-

Stallone lost all sense of realism when he decided to return to the ring and the big screen with yet another Rocky sequel in 1985.Rocky turns political!The mid-80's was when the cold war between USA and the USSR was grabbing much attention in Hollywood. Stallone climbed on the bandwagon and, eventually, destroyed any chance of making the Rocky story legitimate after the second sequel.In a nutshell, Russia sends its biggest fighter Ivan Drago, played by then unknown Dolph Lundgren, to America to challenge one of its two champions: Rocky or Apollo. Apollo responds first, but not before giving his Italian friend another one of his speeches on how a fighter might as well be dead if he stops fighting because that's what he's made for. Ironically, Apollo dies at the hands of the Russian - I repeat, Apollo Creed, the central character of Rocky III, dies (what the heck was Stallone thinking?). Anyways, Rocky agrees to fight Drago in Russia. Okay, I can stop right here because the story gets sillier and sillier.What holds the movie together, however, is the excitement. Yes, despite the negative criticism, Rocky IV does have some good jabs and hooks, and the music, which makes up about half the movie alone, is great!Unfortunately, Rocky IV is the worst of the Rocky series due to its absurdity. The final scene where Rocky gives a speech to the Russian crowd, and the world, about change is ridiculous.C

Red Eye is a fast paced suspenseful thriller from the director of the Scream movies, Wes Craven, and starring Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins).McAdams plays hotel manager Lisa who is on her way to see her father when she meets a mysterious man named Jackson, played brilliantly by Murphy, at the airport right before boarding. While they're on the airplane, Jackson reveals to Lisa that he is plotting to assassinate a homeland security official that is staying at the hotel where Lisa works, and that if she doesn't cooperate with him to move the official to the floor where the killers can get him, her father will die.The movie's fast action and short running time makes it a successful thriller. And it's definitely McAdams and Murphy that turn this simple film into a worthwhile spectacle.RecommendedB-

Remakes, remakes, remakes.Aren't there any creative writers who can make originals anymore?After viewing The Pink Panther, that thought will probably come crossing through your head. If not, then you probably thought this was the funniest movie you have ever seen, and that Steve Martin (The Jerk, Bringing Down The House) is a genius for introducing the whackiest onscreen detective turned inspector.The Pink Panther is actually a remake of the comedy classic starring Peter Sellers (The Party) as the 'original' Inspector Clouseau, a dim-witted detective assigned to some serious high profile cases that he, somehow with a strike of luck and ridiculousness, ends up solving.As the 'new' Inspector Clouseau, Martin fiddles his way through some very funny French accent drivel (especially the part where he's trying to learn how to say the word "hamburger"), laughable attempts to 'teach' his sidekick, a no-joke and far more Inspector-quality type detective Gilbert Ponton played hysterically by Jean Reno (the part where Martin and Reno pretend to be back-up dancers to Beyonce Knowles shows a side of Reno I never expected), about police work, and causing destruction by clumsily rolling a big brass ball through the streets of Paris, burning down the bathroom of Knowles, and unintentionally breaking his superior's, a French minister played by Kevin Kline, bones.Martin has his moments in Panther, but the movie overall just doesn't click into classic motion picture material like its predecessors had become. And as you see, I didn't go into the plot, something involving a big rock known as the Pink Panther getting stolen off the finger of a legendary soccor coach who is assassinated in the beginning, of the film because I found it irrelevent.The movie makes a good passing time but just nothing more than that, and with ending results that are far from spectacular.Mildly recommendedC

What happens next is Emily begins communing with an imaginary friend named Charlie that her father fails to see eye to eye but senses his existence after strange occurences begin happening around the house, including murder.Hide and Seek succeeds in gluing the viewers eyes to the screen and making him ask the usual question of "Who's doing it?"Although I figured out who done it about half way through the movie (because I'm psychic...just kidding!), due to some common horror movie cliches, the movie's stars De Niro and Fanning light up the screen with their excellent performances.A recommended viewingB-

With all the negative reviews I've read on amazon regarding Adam Sandler's most recent comedy Don't Mess With The Zohan, I've discovered that Sandler and cowriter/producer Judd Apatow have successfully created a cult comedy with this one. Either you hate it or love it. I can honestly say that I belong to the latter group.You already know the premise of the film: Sandler is Zohan, a killing machine who works for the Israeli army fighting his arch Palestinian nemesis the "Fantom", played remarkably by John Turturro. However, the Zohan has grown weary and bored of the same old eldless fight, and he aspires to be hairdresser in spite of his parents' mockery.He fakes his death, and escapes to New York, hiding in a cage with two dogs, Scrappy and Coco, on an airplane. Upon arriving to the Big Apple, Zohan adopts the name Scrappy Coco and ends up working for a beautiful Palestinian hairdresser.I just realized that I've just tirelessly summarized the first act of the movie, a movie that is so silly, it's dead-on funny as hell!It's true Adam's immature movie roles have gotten old, but he can still pull off acting stupid in a blink of an eye, or a snip of a pair of scissors.Watch out for hilarious appearances by Rob Schneider, musician Dave Matthews, Kevin James, and singer Mariah Carey.RecommendedB+

It's 2005, and Britain's biggest bands have released new albums, one of which is Oasis' Don't Believe The Truth and the other, of course, is Coldplay's X&Y.;X&Y; is part 3 in the magnificent musicianship and lyricism of Coldplay. Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head are not distant sounds from the tracks on X&Y.; In fact, Coldplay don't try to experiment or push their noise a bit further from what has now become known as the Coldplay style of mellow rock that will quite oftenly put you to sleep. However, they do borrow some musical ideas from bands like U2 and others. Most importantly though, on X&Y; Chris Martin delivers another batch of soft rock popsicles that will be as sweet to you as strawberry cheesecake.The opening track Square One dwells into Radiohead/Pink Floyd land with its atmospheric music and deep lyrics. White Shadows and Talk are obvious inspirations from U2 with their screaming guitars that only The Edge is best at. Coldplay sweetness can be heard on What If?, A Message, Low, and Fix You, a song that's begging to be a hit single. The album's first single, Speed Of Sound sounds a little like Clocks but is a Coldplay classic in its own right with its catchy tune and chorus.At a time when most bands produce a really bad album, go over the edge with production, or simply fade away, Coldplay plays it smart and simple with their third studio effort at a rate where you can almost gaurantee that they will be around for a longer time than expected.Track Picks:Fix YouTalkSpeed Of SoundA MessageRecommendedB

The Farrelly brothers, who brought us Dumb And Dumber and There's Something About Mary, direct Kingpin, a movie starring Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killers), Randy Quaid (Quick Change), and Bill Murray (Groundhog Day).Kingpin is the most hilarious and underrated Farrelly brothers comedy made! It's a story of a has-been bowler named Roy Munson, played by Harrelson, who had lost his hand after his so-called pal Eddie McCracken, played by Murray, runs off and leaves poor old Roy to the gang of bowlers who just got nailed by the duo. Years later, Roy has become a drunken, out of shape, bald headed loser who discovers an Amish farmer, played by Quiad, who can bowl like a pro, and takes him around the country in his car to hustle and win the bowling championship against his arch-enemy McCracken himself. The movie obviously lampoons such past films as The Color Of Money, with a funny spoof on Indecent Proposal, which starred Harrelson also, which features a cameo by Chris Elliot.The movie is not to be taken seriously at all. It is, however, the funniest film made by the Farrellys, and that's just my opinion.RecommendedB

Pirates Of The Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl was an enjoyable, creepy and funny pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest, the film's first of many sequels to come, has Johnny Depp (Donnie Brasco) delivering an extraordinary performance once again, but the movie overall gets washed away into the sea with the Black Pearl.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the film's action sequences, but it didn't awaze me as much as the original did (maybe I'm not a pirate fan after all!). What struck me about Pirates 2 were the cliches (a disgusting Octopus-like creature using its arms to snatch people and destroying the ship has been used before, and is used twice in the film), Depp's satirical performance (running around tied to a barbeque stick), and the cliffhanger ending (brace yourselves for a Pirates 3 movie coming out soon!).Maybe it is me, but Pirates 2 really didn't cause me to jump, cheer, and go insane. Maybe I'm getting old to watch all these Disney films, or maybe the film itself is lacking substance or new material to deliver. It's up to you to judge. One thing I can assure you of is that Pirates 2 is a much better sequel than Superman Returns. Unlike the latter, Pirates succeeds in staying true to its predecessor.Mildly recommendedC

It's cliched entertainment only past superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman used the cliches to make up unique characters that inspired the audience, not bored them to death.The Fantastic Four are four scientists who, after facing an enormous flow of radiation, gain special powers: turning into a ball of fire, going invisible, extending limbs, and becoming a safeguarded body of heavy rock. The film focuses on the scientists trying to return to their normal selves, especially The Thing, whose wife literally divorces him because of his new condition, and suffers social isolation, instead of focusing on the foursome saving the world and fascinating us, the viewers, with demonstrations of their super abilities. Then there's the nemesis Doom, a scientist who was also exposed to the same radiation, whose power is to suck up energy and turn to solid metal.Don't be fooled by the events as I mention them, The Fantastic Four is a silly movie. The plot and the subplots are not coordinated correctly. The Thing's wife never returns to him and there's not a care of trying to win her back either, and the entire love story between The Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic is pointless. The humor in the film is mainly from The Thing crushing everything he holds including a glass, a car, and a fork.The Fantastic Four is not all that fantastic after all.Not really recommendedC-

STOP CRYING YOUR HEART OUT is probably the best track on Oasis' latest album, Heathen Chemistry. For the weak at heart, this song will make you cry. if you hear this and don't feel anything, there's something wrong with you man! it's a song that opens up with a soothing piano intro and liam's gentle voice saying 'hold on...hold up...don't be scared', the song evolves into a tearjerker but uplifting &amp; beautiful tune filled with string arrangements and a chorus that goes &quot;all of the stars have faded away, try not to worry, you'll see them someday&quot; and the haunting voice of Noel responding to liam's 'why you scared?&quot; with &quot;i'm not scared&quot;. a potential number one single and the song that will bring oasis back to the american masses. you just got to love it!Truly Noel's modern day masterpiece.

Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants might not be a great Oasis album, but the singles released from the 2000 effort deliver.Go Let It Out! was the first single released from Giants. The song went straight in at Number 1 in the UK Charts, while hardly appearing on the Modern Rock chart in the US. The song is heavily influenced by The Beatles' Strawberry Fields Forever with the use of a melotron. The song has a brilliant melody, and a laid back Liam vocal duty, in addition to some of Noel's nonsensical lyrics.The b-sides are really the highlights of the single. Let's All Make Believe is one of the best ballads Oasis have ever recorded, a dark and elusive track that is quite touching in its lyrics about being friends despite a fallout (a message probably meant for Bonehead and Guigsy, as Giants was the last album they were to be a part of before quitting the band). Cigarettes in Hell is another mellow track sung by Noel.Go let It Out is one of the best Oasis singles out there!RecommendedA

Carlito's Way is the second collaboration between director Brian DePalma (The Untouchables) and Oscar winning actor Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman), the first being 1983's cult classic Scarface.The movie, like Scarface, is about a Latino gangster only this time our main man is Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican, who's just been released from prison after serving 5 years. The events of the movie are narrated by Carlito himself as he recalls the last part of his life while he lies dying from gunshot wounds.Unlike Tony Montana, Carlito, played brilliantly by Pacino, does not want to to be part of the gang life anymore; instead, he wants to get 75,000 dollars and begin a legitimate business and a clean life with his old flame Gail, played by Penelope Ann Miller (Kindergarten Cop). Unfortunately for Carlito, leaving a life of crime is not going to be that easy. The District Attorney is still trying to pin something against him, his corrupt cocaine snorting lawyer David Kleinfeld, played to maximum perfection by Sean Penn (Mystic River), wants to get him involved in potential trouble with a made man, and an up and coming gangster, Benny Blanco from the Bronx, played by John Leguizamo (Empire), is really pissing him off.The movie has some cool action sequences, especially the pool table scene at the beginning of the movie, and excellent cinematography and direction (the train station chase scene at the end is vividly mesmerizing). But the best that Carlito's Way offers is the intense drama and character study, and Sean Penn's amazing adaptation of a good guy turned crooked and evil. The only flaw in Carlito's Way is the exaggeration of some action sequences (the escalator scene), and unneccesary use of parody (Benny Blanco killing Luis Guzman's character at the end of the movie).RecommendedB+

Lyla is the first single released from Oasis's 2005 album Don't Believe The Truth.The song went straight in at Number 1 on UK's singles chart, while in the US, it only entered Billboard's Modern Rock tracks at number 19.Upon listening to it for the first time, I disliked it. But after repeated listening, it grows on you like fungus until you find yourself stomping your feet, shaking your head, and imitating Liam's singing style as you sing along to every one of Noel's lyrics.Lyla is one of the catchiest songs Oasis have ever recorded, and one of their definite classics.B+

Collateral is a movie directed by Michael Mann (Ali, Heat) and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday). Looking at both actors' resumes, I've realized that Tom Cruise hasn't played a role of a villain for as long as one can remember. And Jamie Foxx hasn't been recognized before for being a good actor, not even in a supporting role.I understand that Cruise would want to play the role of a merciless cold blooded killer to expand his acting abilities. But honestly, the role of Vincent does not fit Tom Cruise's character. The role would have been great for someone like Brad Pitt or, for an older generation, Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx does not fit in the entire picture, let alone the role of cab driver Max, a role that would have been perfect for somebody like Samuel Jackson. He delivers his lines like somebody reading off of a cue card. The scenes that are meant to be intense, like the scene when Vincent's first victim comes falling out of the window and onto Max's cab, become vague and dull with Foxx's overacting and the loose dialogue.Collateral could have been a very good movie if only the director and casting crew would have decided to hire different lead actors.C-

Michael Jackson's 1979 solo debut Off The Wall stands today as Michael Jackson at his rawest and most sincere.Long before the scandals, the nose jobs, and the court appearances, Michael Jackson was the youngest member of the beloved Jackson 5, later known as the Jacksons. In the late 70's, Michael was no longer a little boy, he was a young man who, in a few years, became the biggest selling solo artist and the most exciting live act since The Beatles. He teamed up with producer Quincy Jones, and the result was a collaboration that spawned 3 classic albums within 8 years: Off The Wall, the record breaking Thriller, and Bad.Off The Wall captures Jackson right before the madness kicked in, and it is quite a moment to cherish. The 10-track album features some of Michael's greatest classics: the US number 1 hits Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, and the groovy Rock With You, the sweet ballad She's Out Of My Life (a song so sincere that MJ actually cries at the end), the upbeat Working Day And Night, the Paul McCartney penned Girlfriend, and, one of my personal favorites, the charming title track Off The Wall.Many people regard Thriller, the 1982 follow up, as Michael's greatest achievement. Thriller was so successful that it overshadowed the Grammy winning debut. Whatever the case may be, Off The Wall is definitely Michael's prized contribution to music, an album so sweet and so modest, Michael ought to take lessons from it for his future release.RecommendedA

The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is the new quirky film directed by Wes Anderson and starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters). This movie would be the duo's third time working together after Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.Aquatic is a story of an eccentric oceanographer named Steve Zissou who leads his unusual team of documentary film makers and crew in voyages to discover sea life. It all pays off, however, due to the fact that his documentaries are screened worldwide and he has made global fame for years.The beginning of the movie coincides with the death of his top crew member, Esteban, at the jaws of the mysterious 'Jaguar Shark', while the rest of the film pursues Steve and company on a mission to avenge his friend's death and catch the shark. Although, the movie sounds like an action/adventure, it is that but with a modest Wes Anderson type of humor that he's known for. Murray adds his smart wit to the script as well as the remaining cast including Willem Dafoe in his funniest role to date as the sensitive Klaus Daimler and Cate Blanchett as Jane Winslett Richardson, the pregnant reporter who becomes the love interest despite her romantic affair with his newly found son Ned, or Kingsley Zissou, played by Owen Wilson.The movie features animation of the fantasy sea animals which adds a nice touch to the overall fun that the movie offers, as well as one liners that are destined to be repeated constantly by die-hard Zissou fans.Now go get yourself a red cap and speedo!RecommendedB-

Samuel Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith) delivers one of his most outstanding performances as Coach Ken Carter.The movie is based on the true story of how Carter influenced high schools across the country to choose academics before athletics as an important factor of athletic students' success through school and after by challenging a Richmond, California high school to think again on where they will lead the kids if they do not take it into consideration. As a teacher, I found what Carter did despite the community's hostility towards his decision to close down the school gym until the team's grades went up as revolutionary.The movie is a basketball movie (the most exciting scenes are when the team are winning basketball), but it focuses more on how Carter actually teaches them the value of education, discipline, and respect, thus coaching them through life.RecommendedB+

A delightful comedy directed by John Landis (Trading Places, Coming To America) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) in one of his best performances to date. He plays a gangster who is trying to lead a clean life as a banker after vowing to his dying father (played by Kirk Douglas) to leave his life of crime. The events that occur on the day he will become a banker puts him and everybody around in one big surprise after the other. Funny performances by Marisa Tomei, Tim Curry, and the remaining cast.Oscar is a classic comedy despite the negative reviews it recieved when it was released. The audience loved it.

Cue the music! Rocky Balboa, the most beloved onscreen character and highly anticipated sequel of the the year, is back!Written and directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone in the role that made him a movie star, Rocky Balboa, like the title character, triumphs. This film could end up being the surprise hit of the year.16 years have passed since the last Rocky movie, part 5 that is, Rocky is now a widow; Adrian has been dead for nearly 3 years (Talia Shire appears only in flashbacks). It's a walk down memory lane in the first third of the film as Rocky visits the places he and Adrian met and went to in their early days accompanied by Paulie who dreads the annual ritual because it reminds him of how bad he was to his sister. When he's not touring the sites, Rocky is sitting at Adrian's grave pondering what's left of his own life.Rocky has closed the doors of Mickey's gym, and is now the owner of a local restaurant named after his late wife. Rocky goes around the restarant every now and then, telling customers stories of his glory days. One of his regular patrons is Spider Rico, the guy he fought and defeated in the opening minutes of the original Rocky. Another old face in the neighborhood Rocky bumps into is 'little' Marie, the girl who once told him "Screw you, Creepo" after walking her home and giving her advice on how to live her life. She ends up being a pivotal character in Rocky's post-Adrian life. She even reminds him of Adrian with her encouragement, and support. However, their relationship does not evolve into romance, which is quite understandable.Rocky is in pain. He's old and lonely. He regains the passion to fight again to unleash the 'beast' that is still inside of him. His son, played by Milo Ventimiglia, is striving to find his place in the corporate world but can't escape dad's shadow; and as a result despises his father's decision to return to the ring. Things get heated up when ESPN airs a computer generated fight between the new champ Mason The Line Dixon, played by real life boxr Antonio Tarver, who is disregarded by the boxing community as a phony, and Rocky. Computer says that Rocky would win by knockout. This causes a stir with the press and fans, and gives both Dixon and Rocky the chance to prove their worthiness.Rocky Balboa succeeds in exploring Rocky's inner feelings at his old age. The scene where Rocky expresses that he still has 'stuff in the basement' to Paulie is extremely convincing, especially when the grieving Rocky breaks down in tears. There's also the scene where Rocky angrily refutes the Boxing Commission's refusal to renew his boxing license, a scene so intense, many members in the audience cheered. It's a powerful performance by Sly that will leave audiences wondering why this man has never had the chance to evolve properly as a character actor. Oscar, anyone?The climactic fight scene at the end is incredible. Even the commentator in the movie says he can't believe he is only moments away from watching Rocky fight again. That's exactly the same feeling I had. When the fight did begin, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Stallone's directing is so precise that Rocky's final round, both in the ring and on the movie screens, goes down in style.Would I pay to watch it again?Yo, absolutely!RecommendedA-

The Goo Goo Dolls have always been one of my favorite bands. Ever since their breakthrough hit Name in the mid-90's, the Buffalo, New York group have managed to come out with instant classics, most notably the smash hit Iris, and pretty much all the singles off of Dizzy Up The Girl. Thier most recent effort, let Love In, doesn't fall short.The album opens with one of the most powerful ballads of 2006, the hit single Stay With You. This is followed by a string of wonderful slow and solid surefire rockers: the riveting Better Days, the delightful Supertramp cover Give A Little Bit, the amazing Feel The Silence, the elusive Without You Here, the breathtaking Let Love In, and the awesome album closing Become.Let Love In is an outstanding collection of ballads, songs that the Dolls have been able to master over the the years. I compare their contribution to modern rock to that of what 80's rock band Journey offered us two decades ago.One of the best albums of the year!RecommendedA

Miami is the most talked about city of the year 2006.First, there was the Miami Heat that won the title of the NBA finals championship, and then there was Miami Vice that wins the title of lamest excuse for a movie.Michael Mann (Heat) directs the film based on the famous 80's TV series with the same title. Colin Farrell (The Recruit) and Jamie Foxx (Ray) star as Miami detectives Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs, originally played by Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas respectively, who go undercover and become extremely involved in a drug ring. Sonny falls in love with the wife of a major drug trafficker, and Ricardo puts his family life on the line.There's plenty of scenes of the Caribbean (no pirates though!), unnecessary nudity and sex (especially the dreadful Jamie Foxx shower scene), very little action, but perfectly shot action (Michael Mann is an expert at shooting action sequences, just watch the Downtown L.A. shootout scene in Heat for extra proof), and dull performances by the entire cast, with no exceptions. The plot, along with Mann's gritty cinematography, seems disturbingly hazy, and the resolution leaves you hanging like Colin Farrell's laughable mullet.Not recommendedD

When A Stranger Calls is a remake of the first 20 minutes of the 1979 original with the same title. The movie is directed by Simon West (Con Air) and stars Camilla Belle as Jill, the babysitter who is doomed with constant scary phone calls while on the job.I will not draw any differences or similarities between the original and this new version. Instead, I will discuss this 2006 version independently.The films starts out with a murder. The victims are young children killed when their parents are out and a babysitter is attending for them.Miles away, we meet Jill, a high school student whose dad wants her to take responsibility, so she becomes a babysitter for a wealthy family that own the most awesome and technologically advanced house I have ever seen (the lights go on in all the rooms by simply stepping into them). Jill begins experiencing some freaky phone calls by a man with heavy breathing and simple dialogue like "Have you checked the kids?" and the more chilling "How were they?" after she does check on them.The movie maintains a nice sense of suspense throughout the first half of the film but when the mystery unfolds, it turns into a silly little cliched action film. Enough said!Recommended to a certain degree, but not the best horror film.C+

The Doors is one of the most influential rock bands in American history. The Best of The Doors highlights the band's hottest tracks over the span of its 4 years together that ended with the death of lead singer Jim Morrison.The album includes the hits Light My Fire, Break On Through (To The Other Side), and the epical The End from their self titled debut hit album in 1967. People Are Strange, Strange Days, and Love Me Two Times from 1967's quick follow-up Strange Days are also included. While the radio friendly Hello I Love You, Love Her Madly, Touch Me and Roadhouse Blues are given due credit, the songs L.A. Woman and Riders On The Storm are featured for their epical and classic nature. Other songs included are Five To One, When The Music's Over, and the elusive The Unknown Soldier.The album was released to coincide with Oliver Stone's 1990 movie tribute to the band, The Doors, starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison.One of the best Greatest Hits compilations ever!RecommendedA

In the early 80's, controversial African American comedian Richard Pryor (See No Evil Hear No Evil) was in top form. He was the most influential and electrifying stand-up comic, and one of the highest paid black actors in Hollywood (Pryor was reportedly paid $4,000,000 to appear in 1983's Superman III).In 1982, Pryor agreed to star opposite the legendary Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason (Smokey And The Bandit), in a remake of a 1976 French film titled Le Jouet, which literally means The Toy in english. The outcome was a classic comedy, although hated by many critics, that is still enjoyed and quoted by people today.The Toy is directed by Richard Donner (Superman), and also stars Ned Beatty (Superman), Wilfrid Hyde-White (My Fair Lady), Teresa Ganzel (Monsters Inc), and child actor Scott Schwartz (Kidco).Pryor plays Jack Brown, a struggling and unemployed black writer who will lose his house if he fails to pay $10,000 to pay off his mortgage. Jack finds himself stooping down the social ladder trying to get any job he can get in order to save himself from getting thrown into the street. He finds a job as a cleaning lady for the Bates firm and is hired by Mr. Morehouse, played by Beatty. When local millionaire US Bates, played by Gleason, finds out that one of his cleaning ladies has a moustache, he fires him. To make matters worse, Bates's spoiled little bratty son 'master' Eric Bates, played by Schwartz, arrives in town for a week with his dad, goes to his dad's toy store, and picks out Jack as his toy because he made him laugh. Eric's insistence on keeping Jack and his dad's pampering reults in US negotiating a deal with Jack on the basis that he stays for a week at his mansion to keep his son company. US and Jack go on a collision course over different issues: the amount that Jack needs, US's degrading and racist new wife Fancy Bates, played by Ganzel, and most of all, what the film really focuses on, is how to approach and win over his son.The Toy is a delightful movie despite what many regard it as being Pryor's and Gleason's low points. In fact, The Toy is one of the funniest films and an excellent pairing for both actors.RecommendedA

Idiocracy is the new comedy directed by Mike Judge, the voice and brain behind Beavis and Butthead, and the cult classic Office Space.The film stars Luke Wilson (The Royal Tennenbaums) as Joe Bauers. Joe is a regular guy, but not until he's chosen by the Pentagon as a guinea pig for a hiebernation program that, instead of going for a year, keeps him isolated along with a hooker named Rita, played by Maya Rudolph, for 500 years. When Joe wakes up, he finds a world overrun by morons, and becomes the smartest man in the world.The movie's plot is simplistic, and utterly idiotic as the movie implies. However, being a Mike Judge film, expect moments of hysterical laughter, but overall the movie passes as a mediocre effort.Mildly recommendedC

Syriana is a good but complicated film directed by Stephen Gaghan (writer of Traffic) and starring Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney and Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer (The Sound Of Music), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty).The movie focuses on America's oil interests in the Middle East, and how 'America' with its manipulations, CIA operatives, and foreign agents is able to control the flow of oil in the world.An Arabian Gulf prince, played by Alexander Siddig, whose country is not specifically named, is interested in taking over as king after his ailing father dies so he can develop his country into a powerful economic force with open trade with countries like China, something he knows will disappoint America and Europe. His father, as a result of pressure from the west, chooses his youngest son, a spoiled prince with only money on his mind, as his follower to the throne. Matt Damon plays the prince's economic advisor who believes in his client's ambitions and realizes that he can get richer as his permanent consultant despite going through a family tragedy where his son dies and his wife leaves him to return to America.In another corner in the globe, George Clooney is a CIA operative who discovers he's being used by his government for risky operations, such as a trip to Lebanon to assassinate the ambitious prince, which leads him to a torture chamber where his nails are pulled out with pliers.In the meantime, an oil drilling company has shut down and is sold to another American firm which leads to the unemployment of a number of foreign workers mainly from Pakistan. Two youths, who were amongst those fired, are lured in becoming suicide bombers. Their target: the same big company that took them out of work.What the different events in the movie lead to in the end is one conclusion: that America only cares for itself; that it is the reason why everything that is viewed as evil to the world is happening, while the victims are those that are used and abused by the system of American foreign policy; and that it will get its way and what it wants no matter what.Syriana is a risky Hollywood feature; a very interesting movie with a brand new theme in modern day cinema. The acting and screenplay, which will most definitely be nominated for the Best Original Screenplay oscar, makes the movie pass by at easy pace for the viewers. Clooney's performance is captivating, and worthy of an Oscar nomination. While the performances of Damon, Plummer, Cooper and even Amanda Peets and Alexander Siddig are excellent secondary role players; expect to have a couple of Supporting Actor nominations also.The movie is not for everyone. I am sure that many people will fall asleep or become restless by the end of the movie. But it will provoke you to think about it for a long time. This is why I recommend it only to those who like the 'thinking' movies.B

The second single from Oasis's critically acclaimed 2005 album Don't Believe The Truth is twice the charm.The Importance Of Being Idle is a laid back- very laid back, if you know what I mean(!)- Noel song about laziness. The song is coated with a nice guitar hook sounding more like some surfer guitar rock tune, and the funniest Oasis lyrics to date- just watch the video for extra proof.Idle was Oasis's second UK Number 1 hit single from Don't Believe The Truth, the first being Lyla. It's a cool summer song that is definitely one of the band's classics.B+

The Pursuit of Happyness is the sad but uplifting true story of millionairre stockbroker Chris Gardner. Will Smith (Hitch) plays Gardner with such a sincerity that I will be rooting for him to win this year's Oscar for Best Actor when, not if, he is nominated.The movie pursues Gardner as he struggles with cash, which ends him up on the street with his son, played by Smith's real life son Jaden, who in my opinion deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as well. After being evicted from his home for failing to pay the rent, Gardner goes from the subway restroom to homeless shelters, as his dream of becoming a stockbroker takes it's first but difficult steps as a non-paid intern at a major stock brokerage firm.Pursuit teaches us that we must follow our dreams no matter what might happen. It is truly an inspirational movie that should garner many Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture, and one for Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton who plays Gardner's impatient wife, as well as an award nomination and win for both Smith and son!One of the best films of 2006.RecommendedA

An Innocent Man by Billy Joel stands as one of the earliest records I remember owning and listening to when I was in elementary school in the early 80's. I stumbled upon it at the local library and I felt the need to revisit it, and, man, am I glad I did!Billy Joel had, and probably still does, a unique way in writing his songs and performing them. The combination of the good ol' rock 'n roll sound from the '50's and early 60's, with modern day rock gives An Innocent Man its catchy vibe. The final track Keeping The Faith literally pays homage to that era of music as Billy reflects on and remembers growing up during those golden years of rock. The golden age sound is revealed on mostly all the tracks.Tell Her About It, Uptown Girl, and the opening track Easy Money show Joel at his rawest and poppy-ish best. While songs like Leave A Tender Moment Alone, An Innocent Man, and The Longest Time show there's more soul to the 'piano man' than meets the eye.RecommendedA-

Thriller and Bad were back to back enormous hit albums that cemented Michael Jackson as the 80's undisputed king of pop. Both albums made his debut Off The Wall a thing of the past. Now, it's 1991 and Michael has entered a new decade. Dangerous was released by the end of the year and its first single Black Or White shot straight up to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. The song caused controvery with its spectacular video featuring Michael transforming into a panther and causing havoc in a vacant street with nonstop dancing.Keeping the controversy aside, Dangerous is a collection of above average songs. Remember The Time is a sweet R&B; ballad, Why You Wanna Trip On Me is one of Michael's earliest and best responses to the media, the album opener Jam, a viciously outstanding foot stomper, Heal The World reveals Michael's interest in changing the world to a better place and is one of his finest moments, Who Is It for its strange but wonderful music and a very catchy chorus, Give In To Me with some cool solo guitar by Slash and a song that just kills, Will You Be There with its sweet lyrics and a song that blows up into epic proportions, Keep The Faith with its feel-good vibe, Gone Too Soon an ode to an AIDS stricken deceased young friend, and the title track, the uptempo Dangerous and an awesome way to close up the album.Dangerous is Michael Jackson's last best effort. Since this 1991 multi-platinum selling album, Michael's albums declined in quality, falling in a trap of self repetition (attacks on the media), however, HIStory did have some golden moments as well, and Invincible just did not reach his old glory.RecommendedA

Ashton Kutcher (The Butterfly Effect) and Amanda Peet (One Fine Day) star in A Lot Like Love, a sweet romantic comedy directed by Nigel Cole.Kutcher and Peet play Oliver and Emily, two people who meet by chance and a quick fling onboard an airplane, who don't see each other for another 4 years, spend one day together, part ways, meet again years later, part ways again, and meet again...The movie evolves into a love story that stretches over many years but never gets a grip, more like Rob Reiner's 1989 classic When Harry Met Sally.Like Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, Kutcher and Peet make a good onscreen couple as the chemistry evolves from one time period to another. The movie in general, with its direct appeal to the twenty-something year old audience, is easy to follow and fun at the same time.A Lot Like Love features an excellent soundtrack: Aqualung's Brighter Than Sunshine, Jet's Look What You've Done, Anna Nalick's Breathe, Eagle Eye Cherry's Save Tonight, and Chicago's classic hit If You Leave Me Now, as well as Bon Jovi's I'll Be There For You, performed by Kutcher himself in the film. The movie also stars Kal Penn, famous for his role as Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle.RecommendedB+

Phil Colins is, without a doubt, one of the finest singer/songwriters of recent years (not bad for a drummer, huh?) His talent was born while still in Genesis after Peter Gabriel ditched the band. Since then, he's lead the group into commercial success and then began a career as a best selling solo artist.No Jacket Required was released in 1985 in the midst of the pop frenzy of that era and the music video television madness. Phil was no stranger to pop/rock radio stations and MTV; he offered them a popsicle named Sussudio and that was that for the star. The rest of the hits came rushing behind; the groovy One More Night, the rock epic Take Me Home and the fantastic Don't Lose My Number, which spawned an unforgettable music video. However some other tracks that did not get commercial appeal are as equally good; the smooth low key Long Long Way To Go, which features obvious backing vocals by Sting, remains one of my personal favorites from No Jacket Required, Inside Out and We Said Hello Goodbye (Don't Look Back) which was originally featured as a B-side to the Don't Lose My Number single.Phil went on to release better and more mature work with the Grammy winning But Seriously four years later. His career in the 90's fell short but still maintained good songs here and there; the early millennium saw Phil Collins return to form with groundbreaking productions, and Academy awards. However, No Jacket Required remains to be the album that sold the most copies and is most adored by his fans.RecommendedA-

Whether you are a big fan of Phil Collins, or you thought Phil Collins was just some ridiculous 80's phony popstar, I would recommend you give But Seriously a listen. Of course, if you are a fan, then you probably already have heard this album a thousand times and agree with me, but if you are the latter, you will be surprised at how intense and how artisitic this album is.Up until 1989 Phil dominated both TV and radio airwaves with his suave and cool music videos and songs, ranging from the sweet rock coolness of In The Air Tonight to the bubbly pop of Two Hearts. But Seriously gave Phil a new credibility. Here he is more than just that, he is a perfectionist artist.The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from his past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and earning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of hightlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment.The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's 1990 bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song.Phil Collins still is around today, still making music but nothing as good as But Seriously. You might still think his earlier stuff from the early 80's was amazing, but seriously, this is Phil Collins' best album!A+

Genesis's 1991 album We Can't Dance is one of the most memorable records released over the past 20 years. It was the first time Phil Collins collaborated with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford in nearly 6 years, and the last time he would ever record with them, that is up until their most recent reunion.We Can't Dance combines plenty of humor, as the title infers, great music, serious issues, and instant classics. The album features some of Genesis's best songs to date: No Son Of Mine, a song about family problems, the funny Jesus He Knows Me, a song about decieving evangelists, and I Can't Dance (both songs spawned equally funny and entertaining music videos), the warm ballads Hold On My Heart and Never A Time, the progressive Driving The Last Spike and Dreaming While You Sleep (both songs paying homage to Genesis's early back catalogue when Peter Gabriel was at the helm), and Tell Me Why, a typical Phil Collins song about world poverty.Dance might not be as great as previous albums, but it is an outstanding collection of Genesis songs that any fan can't go without!RecommendedB+

There are two sides to Both Sides, there's the side of Phil we have become familiar with; and there's another that we are just now getting used to.Phil Collins has gone the way many past artists have gone before him on Both Sides, think of John Lennon when he made Instant Karma; the theme I am refering to here is social commentary and political expression. As a matter of fact, Phil did take that direction first when he recorded But Seriously, but here he takes us deeper inside.The title track and first single from the album, Both Sides Of The Story, is a clear statement that there are always two sides to every story. Phil uses the Irish struggle, a family going through divorce, and a ghetto kid confronting a rich man stranded in a poor part of town, as excellent examples of the everyday issues every society faces. It is one of the highlight songs on the album, and one of Phil's best. The album keeps the theme going in tracks like We're Sons of Our Fathers where Phil speaks of modern day family values and how different it is from the old days. We Wait and We Wonder is a critical song about life in Britain facing Irish resistance. That's the side that many fans found as Phil's taking a new direction.The other side is the sweet and catchy ballads and tunes. Everyday is a nice treat, a ballad about how one is getting used to coping with a break up. Can't Turn Back the Years is another beautiful track about how we can't change the past. The song I found to be special on the album was We Fly So Close. This song was probably written while Phil was listening to In The Air Tonight because it has the same drum beat and the same theme. You feel as if you are in space listening to this song, the same effect you get when you listen to In The Air Tonight.RecommendedB

Let There Be Love is the third single released from Oasis's critically acclaimed 2005 album Don't Believe The Truth.It's a sobering, delightful, and mellow rock single featuring both Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, sharing lead vocals, making it their first duet since Acquiesce.The album closing mini-epic has a piano playing throughout, and some of Noel's best lyrics: "Who kicks a hole in the sky, so the heavens would cry over me", and "Shake up your tired eyes, the world is waiting for you".The best part of the song to me personally is when Noel starts his vocal duty with "Come on, baby blue...". Priceless!RecommendedA

It's 2001. Michael Jackson has had his share of the spotlight for nearly 20 years, but recently the kids, the youth, the brats (whatever you like to call them) have found much younger and a little less whiter glory in boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and N Sync. But Michael wants to set the record straight that he still is the true and only undisputed King Of Pop. So he collaborates with the same guys who gave him his glory back in the mid 90's, Riley and Jam, the guy who beat his record as the most artist to receive Grammy Awards in one night, Santana, and a deceased rap star, Notorious BIG, and comes out with a 16 track album and calls it, ironically, Invincible.Okay, so my introduction to the review was a bit sarcastic, but when the subject is Michael Jackson, you can't help it!Invincible opens up with Unbreakable, as if Michael still wants to prove to younger glory that he still counts and that they can't break him? The song is a hard stomping dance number with the taste of Hip Hop, Notorious BIG raps on this one. It is, in Michael's own right, a highlight of the album. Then comes Heartbreaker, an upbeat R&B; track with a heartbreaking chorus. Michael's voice somehow sounds like his younger self. The title track is one that I do not like at all. Sorry, but any song that tries hard to sound like an older song that is much better, Dangerous, is too hard to swallow. Break Of Dawn is where the lights shine once again on Jackson. Honestly, there is no need for Michael to act tough to prove himself, the ballad is where he proves his point without turning the bass and tempo up. Break Of Dawn is an extraordinary R&B; song that sounds like his earlier ballads off Thriller. The collaborations with Riley and Jam have been pulled off excellently. The following track on the list, Heaven Can Wait, is another wonderful exploration in Michael's own exploration of his past glory. The song's got vibe, a heartfelt chorus, and some of Michael's best vocals to date. You Rock My World is an above average R&B; track that R&B; fans will fall in love with. Of course, you've already heard this song and know what I mean. The intro featuring Chris Tucker and Michael debating on whether Michael can 'get the girl' is a bit too naive on Michael's part that he can pull off acting like a kid even at 43 years of age, but the best of it is that it is mildly funny to hear. Butterflies is one of my personal favorites. A cool dreamy love ballad with Michael's vocals reaching its peak on the album. This song can fit easily on Thriller. The album from here on becomes a trip of deja vu in Michael Jackson's post-Bad era. Songs about the media being evil bloodsuckers, Privacy featuring guitar work from Slash who seems to have quit Guns N Roses for Michael; his love of children, The Lost Children; and over-the-top Scream like dance pseudos, 2000 Watts. On the other hand there is the lovely R Kelly penned peace song Cry to look forward to, and the Michael/Carlos Santana duet on Whatever Happens that, unfortunately, is lost in a messy haze of the Babyface penned Don't Walk Away and the absurd Threatened.Overall, Invincible is a mediocre album. It is good in some areas, but falls short in others. On a Michael Jackson scale, this is not a complete album that I was expecting him to comeback with. If Invincible finished its rhythmic theme from tracks like Break Of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait and Butterflies, then Michael could have done some major damage. But to Michael Jackson's hardcore fans, this is definitely a classic. As a former Michael Jackson fanatic personally, Invincible is nothing more than an album that brought back some great memories and could have been much better. Those brats from N'Sync still haven't learned their lesson!7/10

Crash is a remarkable film directed by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote last year's Oscar winning film Million Dollar Baby, and featuring an all-star cast including Sandra Bullock (Speed), Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda), Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary), Terrence Howard (Hustle And Flow), Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), rapper Ludacris (Hustle And Flow), and Larenz Tate (Dead Presidents).The movie is delivered in subplots that eventually collide with one another into the overall main theme. The stories altogether are an honest depiction of American society today, a seriously ill society diagnosed with paranoia, bigotry, and ignorance.What Crash does so profoundly is focus our attention on regular people, and their motives to behave the way they do. For example, the racist Police Officer Ryan, played brilliantly by Dillon (who earned a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance); he hates black people, and doesn't hesitate to sexually harrass a black woman in front of her sophisticated husband, played by Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard respectively. The reason he hates black people is because his father was forced to leave his job for a black man. Besides the white versus black scenario, the movie also turns our attention to the Hispanics being viewed by the white upper class as gang bangers, and the Persians being mistaken for Arabs. There's also plenty of character development, the black police officer who has a drug addicted mother and a delinquent brother, two thieves who ironically discuss matters of racism in society, and an upper class white married woman who chastises everything and everyone including a decent Mexican whom she thinks is a gangster who comes to fix her door. As the movie draws nearer to its inevitable conclusion and final crash, we get a closer look at the cause of the illness itself and find that there might be a solution.Crash earned 3 Oscars (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing) at this year's Academy Awards. It's definitely one of the most controversial and important films of the decade.RecommendedA

Nostalgic. Classic. Guilty pleasure. All these words cross your mind when you think of Journey. All are true. Journey still remains a name in rock history that glows with their outstanding songs and signature sound. Steve Perry remains one of the most convincingly powerful lead vocalists. This album reminds us of, and celebrates, some of their best songs. That pure 80's sound rings sweetly in your ears when you listen to Only The Young, a song that was featured in the Matthew Modine film Vision Quest. If you've seen VH1's Behind The Music edition on Journey, then you would know that this song was dedicated to one of their young fans who heard this song before it was released and just a short while before he died of a terminal disease. The band cried during the show remembering that event, and listening to this song today will probably do the same with you.The remaining tracks include highlights Separate Ways (Worlds Apart), Who's Crying Now, Open Arms, Lights, and the irresistable on-the-road hit Faithfully, which features the brilliant piano intro by Johnathan Cain, and the outstanding guitar solo by Neil Schon. Send Her My Love is one of their finest love ballads and thankfully is featured on this compilation.Soft rock radio stations play the heck out of these songs, but if you want them all on one CD, don't hesitate in getting this album!Retake the Journey now!RecommendedA-

When Eminem first appeared on the scene and, later, made it big, I honestly couldn't stand him. To me, he was irritating, an idiot, and one of lousiest acts in history. I've got to say, though, that over the years, Eminem has produced, with all respect to Dr. Dre, some of the catchiest beats and rhymes of recent years.Curtain Call covers the period between 1999 and 2005, and the four albums that he has put out as of now. The compilation includes the breakthrough hits My Name Is and the Dr Dre duet Guilty Conscience (both from 1999's The Slim Shady LP), the chart breaking The Real Slim Shady, the vicious The Way I Am, and the original Stan (all from 2000's multi-platinum selling The Marshall Mathers LP), the hilarious Without Me, and the dark Cleaning Out My Closet (both from 2002's The Eminem Show), the sweet lullaby Mockingbird, and the bizarre Just Lose It (both from 2004's Encore), and the Oscar winning Lose Yourself, from Eminem's breakthrough movie 8 Mile, is also featured. The album also features the new single When I'm Gone, an excellent spine-tingling tune that follows up Mockingbird as a song written about Eminem's daughter Hailie, and his struggle with insomnia and frustration during his most recent tour.The collection, however, misses some extraordinary tracks that should have been included like White America, Forgot About Dre (featured on Dr. Dre's album 2001), and Mosh, Eminem's 2004 Bush bashing song.However, Curtain Call is still a consistent profile of one of the biggest rap sensations of all time, truth be told!RecommendedB+

What would you do if you were able to go back in time to change something that would effect your present?The Butterfly Effect examines that question and comes up with outrageous results.Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love) stars as Evan, a young man who is able to seizure his way back and forth through time using events that he had recorded in his dairy as his destination. His love and compassion towards his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh, played by Amy Smart, drives him to make amends and alterations to his dreadful and dark past to secure a happy life with her, but Evan is in for one shocking result after another as his alterations turn on him.The movie features a supporting cast including Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction) as Kayleigh's perverted dad, and Melora Walters (Magnolia) as Evan's mother.Despite The Butterfly Effect's dark premise and cliched script, it succeeds in becoming an engaging spectacle of butterfly proportions!RecommendedB

Flightplan is a smart thriller starring Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs) as an architect, who's just become a widow, named Kyle Pratt who boards a two story jumbo jet from Germany back to the States with her 6-year old daughter Julia and a coffin containing the body of her husband (who mysteriously fell from their apartment).She falls asleep and wakes up to find that Julia is missing. Nobody recalls seeing Kyle boarding the plane with a little girl, and there's no record of Julia anywhere. Kyle finds herself in a frustrated ordeal where she is watched over by the flight attendents and an inflight marshal Carson, played brilliantly by Peter Sarsgaard, and will come to realize that she's either crazy or there's a plot against her.I didn't expect much from Flightplan, but the movie succeeds in delivering the thrills and chills, more like an episode of the Twilight Zone, better than most movies of its genre do.RecommendedB+

In the mid-80's, Sylvester Stallone was one of Hollywood's biggest money making actors, and a gauranteed box office draw. He was given a green light by producers to go over the script and make changes the way he saw fit. One of these scripts that Stallone was interested in was called Beverly Hills Cop. The script mixed humor with action; Stallone, however, wasn't keen on comedy so he turned the script into a darker, more action-oriented script. The result was that the producers decided to stick with the original script and give the starring role in Cop to a rising young African American comedian/actor named Eddie Murphy; Stallone, on the other hand, was given the boot. He, however, had finished revising the script, changed the title to Cobra, brought his then wife Brigitte Nielsen to co-star, and filmed it on his own with George Cosmatos, who had directed him in Rambo: First Blood Part 2, as director.Cobra doesn't come close to Beverly Hills Cop. It was a critical disaster despite doing good business at the box office.The story is about a cool cop named Marion Cobretti, so much for Axel Foley, who is known as Cobra. He wears jeans and a pair of dark sunglasses, lives in a slum, drives an awesome car, carries a gun with a cobra drawn on it, tosses one-liners around like frisbies, hardly smiles, and chews on a matchstick (how cool is that?!). He is hired to protect a model, played by Nielsen, who witnessed a group of killers commit their grizzly crime.The films follows Cobra and the model as they escape from the gang to nowhere in particular. And that's where the movie goes: nowhere. In other words, Cobra is plotless. Why are the killers doing what they're doing? To take over the world and start a new order, but why?!On the other hand, the action sequences are unrealistic (Cobra's car flying out of the second floor of a parking structure and taking off like nothing happened), but they are cool just like the movie's main character.Not really recommended, unless you love Stallone and 'cool' action movies (together, that is!).C

When you think about it now, nobody has made quite a decent album worth bragging about in the past 10 years then just a number of bands. One of them is Matchbox 20. This is their debut album, and when a band can come up with at least 3 good songs on their first album, they should know that they are destined for something special.Yourself Or Someone Like You has more than 3 good songs. It has class, style and an incredible singer/songwriter named Rob Thomas. What more can you ask for?The songs to keep your ears open to are Real World, Long Day, 3 A.M., Push and Back To Good. Back To Good is, in my opinion, the best song on the album, and more over, the best song Matchbox Twenty has written so far.As far as debut albums go, Yourself Or Someone Like You is a gem. A nostalgic moment in the life of any band that struggled and finally made it. Think of Oasis' Definitely Maybe or Coldplay's Parachutes. This is Matchbox 20's Definitely Maybe!RecommendedB

Little By Little is a song written and performed by Noel Gallagher. It has a beautiful chord arrangement, nice singing style by Noel, and a gorgeous chorus that elevates the entire song into a brilliant rock n roll anthem. Possibly one of Oasis' best songs in the past three years.She Is Love is another Noel song. This one is a dreamy love song with amazing lyrics and handclaps that come on near the end of the song giving it an edgy feel.Two beautiful Oasis songs released as A-sides. What more do you ask for?If you enjoy this, i recommend you purchasing Heathen Chemistry.

James Bridges (Urban Cowboy) directs Michael J. Fox (Back To The Future), Phoebe Cates (Fast Times At Ridgemont High), and Keifer Sutherland (The Lost Boys, Stand By Me) in this overlooked 80's movie about a man's struggle with a dark past and the overwhelmingly hysterical cocaine-driven nightlife of New York City.Fox plays Jamie Conway, a struggling writer and editor in a small time magazine, who has just been dumped by his big shot model wife Amanda and is still mourning the death of his mother from cancer a year ago. He's also concerned with a newspaper article following the tragic events of a pregnant woman in coma simply because it reminds him of the last conversation between him and his dying mother about how painful it was for her to give birth to him because he "didn't want to get out".The events of the movie pursue Jamie on his manic pursuit of Amanda and the fact that he feels used and terribly upset with the way she left him, and his dreadful shortcomings at work that cost him his job. The main focus of the movie however is how addicted Jamie gets to cocaine and the negative results it has on his health. Keifer Sutherland plays Aligash, a suave businessman who joins Jamie in the crazy nightlife scene and ends up hooking him up with a woman that seems to be what Jamie was looking for for a long time.Although the movie might seem plotless, it captures a certain vibe that you can't seem to pull away from. It's also very interesting to see Fox play a character that totally defines the complete opposite of what Marty McFly is.Bright Lights, Big City features cameo appearances by high profile actors like John Houseman, Sam Robards, and Dianne Wiest.RecommendedB

Rushmore is a quirky and delightful motion picture directed by Wes Anderson (Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou) and starring Jason Schwartzman (Simone) and Bill Murray (Groundhog Day).The movie is similar to classic films like Harold And Maude and The Graduate in that it's a story of a young man who becomes infatuated with a teacher at his school, an older and much wiser woman.The movie pursues Max, played by Schwartzman, a loser, who somehow fits into many clubs at Rushmore private school including theatre, cheerleading, and the debate team. He meets Herman Blume, played by Murray, a well off businessman and father of some of the boys at the school, who thinks Max is a genius. Max also meets Miss Cross, a British elementary teacher, whom he becomes attracted to. Max introduces Miss Cross to Herman and the two become more than friends in no time. Max is left feeling betrayed by Herman and fooled in thinking that he can actually get Miss Cross to be all his. Max's hilarious escapades as he attempts to take revenge on Herman and Herman's retaliations are some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen.The movie features music from 70's artists such as Cat Stevens, who also provided music for Harold And Maude adding another close similarity to the 70's classic, John Lennon and The Faces.RecommendedB+

Night at the Museum is a new film produced by Chris Columbus (Home Alone), and starring Ben Stiller (Zoolander), Robin Williams (RV), Dick Van Dyke (Mary Poppins), Mickey Rooney (The Black Stallion), and Bill Cobbs (The Color of Money).Stiller plays Larry, a divorced dad who doesn't have a steady job. Larry wants to impress his son for Career Day, so he gets a job as a night watchman at a historic museum only to discover that everything in the museum comes alive at night including President Teddy Roosevelt, played by Williams, an annoying little monkey named Dexter, wild animals of the African jungles, Attila the Hun, the cavemen, the miniature Romans led by Octavius and cowboys led by Jedidiah, played by an uncredited Owen Wilson, and a T-rex skeleton.The movie features veteran actors Van Dyke, Rooney, and Cobbs in roles of old timer watchmen who offer Larry the job, and who we later discover are scheming for something bad; these roles are so silly for men their age, that they could destroy what's left of their legacy. The film also features an unnecessary cameo appearance by Charlie Murphy, Eddie's brother and regular on the Dave Chappelle Show, as a taxi driver.Night at the Museum is a silly movie. Even for a children's movie, the movie is enriched with cheesy cliches, and still lacks the consistency and logic of other successful children's movies like, say, Home Alone or Jumanji. However, it does have a few laughs.I honestly felt like a 'dum-dum' watching this movie, but I've felt worse watching other movies this year.Not really recommendedC-

Sweden seems to be a very quiet country. Once in a while a lot of noise comes out of it that eventually fades away years later but leaves a permanent emotional mark. In the 70's, they gave us ABBA, and in the late 80's and well into the 90's, Roxette was a worldwide sensation.Comprising of two members, the voice Marie Fredriksson (vocals) and the mind Per Gessle (songwriter, guitarist, sometimes vocals), together this pair produced a string of chartbreaking hits on both sides of the Atlantic, and instant classics.All the wonderful songs are included in this must-have compilation: the major US number one hit singles It Must Have Been Love (from the Pretty Woman soundtrack), The Look (their first big break in North America), and Listen To Your Heart (a beautiful chart topping ballad). The album also includes the power ballads Spending My Time, and Fading Like A Flower (Every Time You Leave), the mindblowing Vulnerable (featuring Per Gessle on lead vocals) , Almost Unreal (from the box office flop Super Mario Bros), Crash Boom Bang, and the fun pop tunes How Do You Do? and Joyride. The album also features four newer songs as of 1995 including the irresistably good You Don't Understand Me and the Beatlesque hippy tune June Afternoon.Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus is a perfect substitute for most of the Roxette collection of albums.Definitely worth owning!RecommendedA

Next up is the number one hit Learn To Fly, a song most remembered for its funny music video featuring Grohl in three different roles on board an airplane. The cool songs keep on coming with Gimme Stitches, Generator, Aurora, Next Year and Ain't It The Life.In their ten years of making music together, There Is Nothing Left To Lose is by far their finest moment.Track picks:Stacked ActorsBreakoutLearn To FlyGimme StitchesGeneratorAuroraNext YearRecommendedA-

The Illusionist is a fascinating film directed by Neil Burger (Interview with the Assassin) and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Jessica Biehl (Stealth), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde).Norton plays magician Eisenheim in 19th century Vienna. The Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, is offended by Eisenheim because of his sudden appeal to the masses, and particularly to his wife to be Sophie, played by Biehl, who happens to be Eisenheim's childhood darling and current love interest. Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.RecommendedB+

It's already been 3 years since this album was released. Along with his new release, Roadsinger, An Other Cup is proof that the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens is still amongst us making music that sing to the heart and soul. What more could we ask for?An Other Cup is a gentle folk rock album comprising of songs that range from very good to forgettable. The very good ones include the album opener Midday (Avoid City After Dark), the remake version of I Think I See The Light, the elusive Heaven/Where True Love Goes, the beautifully written Maybe There's A World which can easily fit on Tea For The Tillerman, the wonderful In The End, and, my personal favorite, the biographical The Beloved, a song Yusuf wrote about the Prophet Muhammed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks are forgettable.Regardless of the flaws, I found An Other Cup a decent album and worthy of much appreciation.

An Evening With Kevin Smith is Clerks director Smith's up-close-and personal meeting with the fans on five different university campuses across America.Smith's love of dialogue and flamboyant sense of humor makes watching his gig very enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of his films. Smith answers various questions from the crowd, talking about everything from Jay and Silent Bob, Ben f**king Affleck, producer Jon Peters, Superman Lives, Tim Burton, his wife, and the origins of the word "shnoogans". Kevin even demonstrates his gratitude to his fans by calling a former boss of one of the guys to get his job back, disciplining another guy who wouldn't shut his mouth by calling his dad, and inviting Jason Mewes, Jay to Smith's Silent Bob, with him on stage at the University of Wyoming.What surprised me the most is Kevin Smith's ability to take a stage for long hours- almost 4 hours- and an uncanny talent for comedy- for a while you forget you're watching a film director and think he's a stand-up comedian.RecommendedA-

Kill Bill is an amazing spectacle directed by the best filmmaker in Hollywood today, Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs), and starring Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), Lucy Liu (Lucky Number Slevin), and Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs).Kill Bill is a revenge tale that wastes no time in delivering a heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords, and quirky dialogue. From the opening credit scene, we are introduced to the blood-splattered and very pregnant 'The Bride', or Black Mamba, played by Thurman, all beaten up and unconscious. Not even a minute later, The Bride confronts the first of the 5 people who betrayed and attempted to kill her, Vernita Green, played by Fox. The bloody battle goes down in Green's lovely home before her daughter returns from school and interrupts them. This is just one example of how Kill Bill, or shall I say Tarantino, mixes humor with hardcore violence. It turns out that The Bride used to be in a group of professional killers called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or DiVAS, that, besides Green, included the leader of the pack Bill, played by Carradine, a one-eyed blonde maniac named Elle Driver, played by Hannah, a Japanese gang leader named O-Ren Ishii, played by Liu, and Bill's trailer dwelling brother Bud, played by Madsen. The Bride wants to kill each and every one of them starting with Vernita, then Ishii, then Bud, and Elle, then, finally, the head honcho Bill.Kill Bill Volume 1 covers The Bride's revenge spree that takes on only the first two characters. However, with a character background study on Ishii, shot in animation, and The Bride traveling to Okinawa to meet Hattori Hanzo, an infamous Japanese-steel sword maker, played by legendary Samurai-movie actor Sonny Chiba, so he can build her the most fatal weapon on earth, extends the movie's running time to over 2 hours. The other three on The Bride's list are taken care of in the equally long and outstanding Volume 2.Kill Bill has been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. It is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films, along with it's sequel, of the first decade of the millennium.RecommendedA

With the release of Bullet In A Bible, it has become recorded proof, both in picture and sound, that Green Day are one of the best live acts and greatest rock bands of all time.Frontman Billie Jo Armstrong's energetic performance, along with Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool, has elevated the band of three to a level, not even they ever expected, of nostalgia, greatness, and rock royalty with the likes of bands such as Queen. Actually, Billie Jo's onstage antics, humor and performance is somewhat similar to Freddy Mercury's.I was lucky enough to go watch Green Day at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit on September 11, 2005. The show blew me away. Billie Jo kept the crowd on its feet and their hands in the air shouting, screaming, and singing along throughout the concert that lasted more than 2 hours. I have never been to a concert where I didn't get bored not even for a second, or get tired by the end of the show. This is evident on the recording as well. The song King For A Day, which appeared near the end of the set, which mixes into a medley featuring the song You Make Me Wanna Shout (the Detroit show also featured the classic Stand By Me), was one of the highlight moments, and the crowd were so into it, you can hear them shouting so hard and singing along...it's just too good to be true.Bullet is a dual disc, one of which is the audio CD of the concert recorded in Milton Keynes, England, and the other is a visual/audio DVD of the same live show. What can I not say about it? It's remarkable to say the least. It was also very reminiscent of the Detroit show (the same exact lines that Billie Jo would say to the crowd, the crowd responses and sing alongs...etc.) so the band have got their act well figured out.The concert begins with a string of songs from 2004's American Idiot: the title track American Idiot, Jesus Of Suburbia (featuring all 5 parts), Holiday, Are We The Waiting, and St Jimmy. The response of the crowd is astounding to each one of these numbers, it gets quite deafening if you have the volume all the way up. Green Day then play a set of their greatest hits including the songs, in no order, Basket Case and Longview from 1994's Dookie, Brain Stew and Jaded from 1995's Insomnia, Minority from 2000's Warning, and King For A Day and Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) from 1997's Nimrod. American Idiot is revisited later on during the show with the hits Boulevard Of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends.The DVD also features behind the scenes footage of the band discussing the songs and their worldwide mega success.RecommendedA

While I was reviewing State Of Grace, I was debating whether to give it 4 or 5 stars. Despite the movie's mild reception at the box office and the little credibility it gets today, I realized that it actually is a classic nontheless. First of all, the movie sparked excellent performances by the entire cast, including Sean Penn (Fast Times At Ridgemont High), Ed Harris (The Truman Show), Gary Oldman (JFK), Robin Wright (Forrest Gump), John C. Reilly (The Aviator), John Turturro (Do The Right Thing), R.D. Call (Young Guns II), and Burgess Meredith (Rocky). Secondly, the movie's storyline and script, although familiar, are epical in their own right.State Of Grace is about an undercover cop named Terry Noonan, played by Penn, who is assigned by his superior officer Nick, played by Turturro, to infiltrate a New York City Irish gang led by the sadistically merciless Frankie Flannery, played by Harris, and his crazy hard-drinking brother Jackie, played remarkably by the scene-stealing Oldman. Both Flannerys used to be Terry's close friends before he escaped their life of crime to Boston to join law enforcement. Terry will have to crack down on his friends and in the process risk being uncovered, as well as losing the loyalty of Jackie, who he loves like a brother, and the love of the Flannery sister Kathleen, played by Penn's future wife Wright.The movie was released in the fall of 1990 and was overshadowed by another gangster movie that earned Academy Awards; that movie, of course, was Martin Scorsese's brilliant Goodfellas. But State Of Grace, with or without awards, remains to be a powerful gangster movie that shines thanks to the sincerity of an all-star cast.RecommendedA

Assault On Precinct 13 is an action packed film starring Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Lawrence Fishburne (The Matrix), John Leguizamo (Carlito's Way), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Ja Rule (Scary Movie 3), Gabriel Byrne (End Of Days), and Maria Bello (Secret Window).The story is set on a very snowy day in Detroit where a group of the city's dirtiest criminals including cop killer and big time gangster Marion Bishop, played by Fishburne, are held in broken down Precinct 13 managed by troubled cop Jake Roenick, played by Hawke, and a few of his staff. All of a sudden, an army of corrupt police officers led by Marcus Duvall, played by Byrne, storm the precinct in an effort to kill everyone inside for the sake of getting their hands on Bishop. Jake finds himself put in a dilemma where he will have to put his hand in the hands of criminals to survive throughout the night and make it out alive.The script, like the story, is vague. Ethan Hawke, who earned an Oscar nomination for Training Day, seems to be overacting; the screenplay, on the other hand, seems to have been written over a short period of time, giving the actors little to work with. And throughout the time the poor good guys and bad guys were held in the precinct, I was wondering why didn't anyone pick up a cell phone and call for back up!?Mindless action movie lovers will love Assault, but avid film-goers, like myself, will most definitely pass it by.Not really recommendedD+

In 1995, Michael celebrated almost 20 years as a solo artist with the masterpiece HIStory. A two disc set, one of which is a compilation of 15 of his greatest work since Off The Wall in 1979. All the singles that made him what he is today are included; Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Man In The Mirror, The Way You Make Me Feel and Black Or White. Some great songs, however, were left out that should be considered a crime; Give In To Me, Dirty Diana, and Leave Me Alone. Attempting to top that extraordinary body of work, Michael delivers another 15 newly released tracks on a seperate disc. The result is beyond expectations.The opening track, Scream, marks the first duet between Michael and his sister, Janet. With a pairing this strong comes a song that is even more powerful. Scream is one of the best R&B;/Dance numbers ever put on tape. First single off the record marking one of Michael's most celebrated top ten hits. They Don't Care About Us is a high powered revolutionary anthem. Michael gives his most open thoughts on social injustice, police brutality, and racism. This is one of the best Michael Jackson songs I have ever heard. Then comes Stranger In Moscow, a song that tops the previous two tracks by far. An engaging low key R&B; song that speaks about loneliness. The track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and the delicate accoustic guitar and what sounds like fingersnaps. Michael's vocals are the best in a long time. The best song on HIStory. This Time Around is Hip Hop featuring a rap by Notorious BIG. Earth Song is about peace on earth; only this time, the earth is the one calling for peace, and not the man in the mirror. Another highlight on HIStory. D.S. is a rock song featuring none other than Slash on guitars. A catchy tune where Michael is going at it with Dom Sheldon (D.S.), who is pretty unknown to me. Money is a fierce attack on the families of the boys who accused him of child molestation. "You would do anything for money", he sings, "I'd lie for you, die for you, you would sell my soul to the devil" Michael covers the Beatles on the following track, Come Together, adding more frustration and fury to the millions of Beatles fans that Michael can take advantage of the Beatles catalogue the way he pleases. Good cover though. You Are Not Alone, the only US chart topper on HIStory, is written by R Kelly and it is, in Michael's own right, one of Jackson's best songs in the past 10 years. More than 10 listens later, however, you're bound to stop listening to it for the rest of your life! Childhood and Tabloid Junkie are filler tracks. Childhood was featured as the B-side of Scream. It should have been that way in the first place and not end up on the record. Tabloid Junkie, Michael's aggressive attack at the media that's dogging him, also would have sounded good as a B-side. 2 Bad is a hard stomping dance number featuring Shaq O'Neal on rap duty. Another highlight on HIStory. History, the title track, can easily be viewed as the 20th century's anthem. The song features tons of famous sound clips from Martin Luthur King, JFK, Armstrong, Lindbergh, and Michael himself! The song features backing vocals by Boyz 2 Men. Little Susie is a little opera about a girl named Susie who was abused and killed by her foster parents. The album closes with a rather daft rendition of Smile.Overall, HIStory is one of the 90's best albums. An above average record celebrating the man who made the 80's music scene a cool place to be!RecommendedB+

Alexander Payne is fast becoming one of the most interesting film directors in the business. His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies. His latest, Sideways, is no different.Sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Jack is supposedly getting married in a week, while Miles is still suffering from a two year old divorce. The two men go on a trip through the wine counties of California on a wine-tasting tour that Miles is an expert at. Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Jack has a dirty plan of enjoying one last sexual fling before he ties the knot and at the same time show his depressed buddy Miles that life is still worth looking into and enjoying by trying to hook him up with Maya. Miles becomes outraged with Jack's disloyalty and at the same time his own struggles to fall in love again.With funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience. Even if you are not a middle aged person, you will still enjoy watching Church and Giamatti in their ridiculous and sometimes absurd shenanigans.RecommendedB

Aliens have invaded the earth in many movies, but not one of these movies had Tom Cruise running around with a child in his arms. So, Steven Spielberg bought the rights to remake the original War Of The Worlds and cast Cruise in the lead role with Dakota Fanning as the child star.The movie has its classic moments. The first 25 minutes of the movie are quite breathtaking. After we see the huge alien shooting his rays at people and in the process turning them to ashes, we get the point. Actually, we get the sense that we've seen this movie before under a different title with the same special effects.The movie deals with the sentiments of survival, tragedy, and hope; that's exactly what previous disaster films like Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow dealt with too.Despite that the movie has nothing new to offer the viewers, War Of The Worlds will not fail to entertain you for 2 straight hours. By the final 20 minutes, I was wondering how on earth they were going to end it (keep in mind that I haven't seen the original) and when it does end, you don't realize it did until Morgan Freeman's narration explains what happened.Watch out for Tim Robbins in a very small screen time, and quite unnecessary if you ask me. He plays an underground resistance fighter. I realize that Tom Cruise could have handled the scene with Robbins all by himself. Is it the fact that Spielberg wanted to add Robbins for the sake of having an Oscar winner in the movie. Most definitely!On the other hand, Dakota Fanning is the sweetest child actor around today. She has a definite future ahead of her in movies, I just hope Hollywood doesn't exploit her when she gets older.Not really recommended unless you're a die hard fan of Cruise or special effects films.C

It was July 2000, Oasis played Wembley Stadium in London for two nights in a row. The heat was on, the expectations were high, and the thousands of fans that crammed the famous soccor field were "mad for it!" Everything was going good; Oasis were and still are the biggest band in England with a timeless influence on most of the bands coming out of America and Europe today, and they were to take the stage by storm, but there was one too many problems: Liam had just broken up with his then wife actress Patsi Kensit, was seriously drunk, and Noel wasn't talking to him. The effects of all of the above are evident on this recording.Liam greets the fans as soon as he steps onstage after the intro of F**kin' In The Bushes fades out with a hammering comment at Wembley Stadium, calling it a 'sh*thole', before sarcastically and hilariously saying "Hello, Manchester!" which is welcomed with a few boos from the crowd and a giggle from Noel. After that, the music plays on with a collection of their most recent singles from their 2000 album Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants: the handraiser Go Let It Out and the soothing Who Feels Love, before venturing into a string of greatest hits, in no order: Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Live Forever, Stand By Me, Roll With It, Champagne Supernova, and Supersonic. In between songs, Liam and Noel are heard commenting with and at the crowd ("This is for all the people in the front row..." as Liam presents a song), the lighting operator ("...turn the f**kin' light off!" as Noel scorns the poor fellow), and each other ("Let's have a couple more of these songs, Noel...write a couple more of these babies!" as Liam presents Supersonic). The highlights on Familiar To Millions are the cover versions of The Beatles' Helter Skelter (taken from the US tour), and Neil Young's Hey Hey My My (which Noel sings with a passion), and the B-side Step Out (which is an underrated Noel sung number).Familiar To Millions may not be the best live album ever released; in my opinion, it is not (Liam's tired voice is enough to convince me). But the Gallagher brothers manage to make it unintentionally entertaining and funny at times.RecommendedB-

"I'm freeeeee...to be whatever I, whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want!"These were the opening lines of Oasis' December 1994 released top 10 hit single Whatever, a song that would set the tone for that year, and the year that followed, and was a teaser for what Oasis would sound like on their higly anticipated second album What's The Story Morning Glory, which would be released in the Fall of 1995.The song is such a great tune, words cannot describe it.With an obvious inspiration from The Beatles' post '67 recordings, especially All You Need Is love, apparent by the use of an orchestra (Those violins are out of this world), and lyrics so bold and straightforward that Noel himself can't top, and Liam's vocal reaching its peak, Whatever can easily be voted as the best song Oasis have written and performed throughout their entire career, only Live Forever goes head to head.It's just a song to celebrate to, to play and sing along to at the top of your voice (make sure you're by yourself though!)The B-sides: It's Good To Be Free, and Half The World Away, both featured on The Masterplan, are excellent songs also.Now get a grip on yourself, It don't cost much!RecommendedA

Red Hot Chili Peppers is a band worth exploring. This I've learned after 'experiencing' their latest album Stadium Arcadium, which in my opinion is the best album of 2006 so far. Anthony Keidis's unique singing style, Flea's thumping bass, and Chad's excellent drumming is missing one important element on One Hot Minute. That important element is none other than guitarist John Frusciante, who was like an estranged family member during the mid-90's (his drug addiction was a main factor behind his fallout with the band). Frusciante would return to the Peppers on the follow up, 1999's Californication.Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro replaces John, adding a more rock edged ingredient to the Pepper's spicy funk. As a matter of fact, One Hot Minute is more rock than funk, making it the first and only album where the Peppers dropped their signature funkiness. Okay, enough of the funk talk! Let's talk about the songs on the album.For the most part, I didn't know what to make of One Hot Minute when I first bought it in '96, when I heard it on and off for 4 or 5 years, and when I had it collect dust on my CD rack for a another 4 or 5 years. Warped, the album opening track, comes bursting out loud and heavy with the an instantly catchy rock vibe before the list of songs come dragging behind: the radio friendly single Aeroplane (a song that might sound innocent until the 'f' word comes blurting out), the Jim Morrison inspired spoken track Deep Kick, the brilliant hit single My Friends (an ode to the late actor River Phoenix), the completely unnecessary and profane Pea, the funky Walkabout, the hit-and-miss ballad (with some profanity) Tearjerker, the dark, hard rocking title track One Hot Minute, and the Jimi Hendrix inspired Coffee Shop.The album's overall staleness and lack of direction is excused for the most part due to the absence of Frusciante. However, Minute offers some tracks that cannot be missed on a Greatest Hits compilation. The Peppers would eventually go on to make bigger and better albums after Minute, the return to form Californication and the outstanding modern classic Stadium Arcadium with John back onboard. One Hot Minute now symbolizes One not so Hot Minute in the band's career. A minute well worth forgetting.Track Picks:WarpedAeroplaneMy FriendsOne Hot MinuteMildly recommendedC-

Alanis Morissette's 1995 album that began a neverending thread of crazy girls everywhere growing their hair really long, picking up guitars and pouring their craziest thoughts out in the form of a rock song. Jagged Little Pill exceeds in its versatility. Whether its just a little bit crazy, &quot;Right Through You&quot;, or bizarrely crazy, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, Alanis pitches the ball too fast for your bat to swing at!But where the album really find its resting spot is in the lower pitch songs such as 'Hand In My pocket' and 'Ironic', two of the most outstanding songs written in the past quarter century. 'You Learn', 'Not The Doctor' and the hidden track 'Your House' are excellent examples of ideal songwriting.What's more inspirational about Jagged Little Pill is the fact that Alanis was a teenybopper before taking the leap into real musicianship. More or less, she is the female version of Robbie Williams, or vice versa.Recommended

George Michael is a veteran pop star who survived the 80's well into the 90's, and here's the proof to it.Released in 1996, Older shows Michael as a matured songwriter and musician. The intelligent Jesus To A Child, the first single released, is an underrated masterpiece. The sultry dance track Fast Love, another single which charted pretty well on both sides of the Atlantic, is one song that shouldn't be missed on a George Michael greatest hits compilation. Then there's the groovy hit single Spinning The Wheel, the passionate It Doesn't Really Matter, the tingling The Strangest Thing, and the poppy crooner Star People.RecommendedB

Hustle And Flow is a brilliant movie produced by John Singleton (Boys N The Hood), and starring Terrence Howard (Crash), Taryn Manning (A Lot Like Love), DJ Qualls (Road Trip), Anthony Anderson (Scary Movie 3), and rapper Ludacris (Crash).Terrence Howard plays a down-on-his-luck and desperate mid-aged Memphis pimp Djay who wants a way out of his crooked life by becoming an aspiring rapper. He gets inspiration from his favorite girl Nora, played by Manning, and help to record a demo in his broken down home from another one of his girls, a pregnant woman with a soulful voice, and local sound mixers and technicians, played by Anderson and Qualls. He finds out that local rap star Skinny Black, played by real life rap star Ludacris, is coming to town so he sets up a plan to meet him, give him his demo tape, and make it to the big time.Hustle And Flow succeeds in engaging the audience with its main character's dilemma. And it is, of course, the once secondary role playing, now A-list actor Terrence Howard who is the driving force behind one of the best movies of 2005.The movie features an outstanding soundtrack, including the Oscar winning song Hard Out Here For A Pimp.RecommendedA

In recent years, Hollywood saw an emerging generation of actors particularly from the hip-hop world.Eminem made a lasting impression with 8 Mile, Dr. Dre made a flashing appearance in Training Day, and Snoop Dogg has made several movies including Bones and Soul Plane (both flopped). With the rise of a star in the hip-hop world these days, there seems to be a trend of have-to-make-a-movie-next. 50 Cent, who I honestly and without bias don't understand the hype that surrounds him, fails to leave any sort of impression in this film about his life in the streets, near death incident, and rise to fame. Where Eminem succeeded in engaging the audience with his life in the down under and how he crossed the line to public adoration and respect after a climactic rap battle, Fiddy just doesn't reach a climax nor attract cheers.The movie starts by showing 50 getting shot about 10 times leaving him for dead, but only to be saved at the last minute by paramedics. Travel back in time, 50 is raised by a drug dealing mother who gets killed in front of his eyes. He's brought up by his relatives. Slowly, the little boy becomes a drug dealer, looking for a way out through rap. Earlier this year, John Singleton explored this issue with the incredible Hustle And Flow starring Terrence Howard who appears in Get Rich as Marcus's, 50's character in the film, eccentric partner in crime. However, Howard's turn in and the movie Hustle And Flow outweighs this by way more than 50 million cents!All in all, Get Rich Or Die Trying, is not a great movie. It's not even a good movie. It's a movie I would classify as a special interest film. The only people I recommend this movie to are hip-hop lovers or 50 Cent fans. But for the movie lovers, this is definitely not the golden ticket of the year.Not recommendedD+

Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet little comedy starring Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets), Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Steve Carell (40-year Old Virgin), Alan Arkin (Glengarry Glen Ross), and young actors Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (Signs).The movie revolves around a typical American dysfunctional family: Richard, the dad, who is a terrible motivational speaker, always lectures his family members on the 9 steps to success, even though he's a failure himself; Sheryl, the mom, is completely passive; Dwayne, the son, hates his family and chooses not to speak to them at all; Uncle Frank tried to committ suicide over a male graduate student of his; Grandpa is a heroine snorter; and Olive, the chubby daughter and only hope for some ordinary life in the house, wants to become California's Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.After being informed that Olive has been picked as a contestant, the family hit the road to the beauty contest in a van that needs to be pushed to get going, and doesn't stop honking. In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.RecommendedB+

Green Day made their most important album, 2004's American Idiot, 15 years after forming their band. 2006 is the year for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to do the same thing.Stadium Arcadium is a solid 2-disc 28-track album featuring the Peppers at a more focused and much more mellowed out form than their previous albums, while maintaining their funk along the way (just listen to Hump De Bump for proof). Lead vocalist Anthony Keidas's signature singing style, Chad's precise drumming, and Flea's funky bass playing can't quite keep up with the energy that guitarist John Frusciante brings to the California quartet's groovy sound formula (If you thought that John's ethereal guitar licks on Scar Tissue were out of this world like I did, then there's plenty to be mesmerized by and discovered on Arcadium). In a nutshell, Stadium Arcadium is extremely infectious, and is destined to be the biggest rock album of the year.The album's first single, and album opener, Dani California is by far the best rock single released so far this year. The track follows up on Dani, a character referenced in 1999's Californication and mentioned in 2002's By The Way; the song also triggered a memorable music video featuring the band impersonating The Beatles and Nirvana amongst others. As a group, the Peppers deliver some of their best tunes to date using the same ingredients they've used before, mixing funk, punk, alternative rock, and Beatlesque harmonies: the groovy ballad Snow (Hey Oh) and C'mon Girl, the even groovier Charlie, the mellow future single Stadium Arcadium, the elusive Lenny Kravitz style rocker She's Only 18, the 70's style rocker Strip My Mind, the surreal Especially In Michigan, the acoustic Slow Cheetah, the bass driven Torture Me, the cool rockers Warlocks, Storm In A Teacup, She Looks To Me, Make You Feel Better, and Desecration Smile, the radio friendly Tell Me Baby, and, one of my personal favorites, what could possibly be the strongest ballad the Peppers have ever written Hard To Concentrate.16 years have passed since the band made their first mark in the mainstream. With the release of Stadium Arcadium, it seems that the Chili Peppers are just now getting hotter!Track Picks:Dani CaliforniaSnow (Hey Oh)CharlieStadium ArcadiumShe's Only 18Slow CheetahStrip My MindEspecially In MichiganDesecration SmileTell Me BabyHard To ConcentrateMake You Feel BetterStorm In A Teacup

I'm thinking the year 2000; I was invited to go see Duran Duran at Pine Knob (known today as DTE Energy Music Theatre) in Detroit by a fellow John Lennon message board user. Little that I knew that I was about to be introduced to a brand new thrilling band that quite frankly could have blown the headlining stars away. Tsar was their name and Silver Shifter was the song that drew me to them.Later as I was hosting my own show on WHFR 89.3 FM, a college based non commercial radio station in Detroit, I discovered that the station carried a copy of Tsar's album. I jumped on it like a lion attacking its prey and for the next 2 years of spinning discs on the air, Tsar's self titled album was one of my regulars!The album is a powerful display of some of the best pop/rock tunes you've ever heard. Take the opening song Calling All Destroyers, not since Oasis damaged our ears with the magnificent wall of sound called Rock 'n Roll Star on their debut album Definitely Maybe has a song caused such an effect. That's not all though, each track is essential in its own right: I Don't Wanna Break Up is awesome, and so is Kathy Fong Is The Bomb, Teen Wizards, Monostereo, Ordinary Gurl, Girl Who Wouldn't Die, and the highlight Silver Shifter.There are many apparent inspirations on Tsar, ranging from bubblegum pop acts like Duran Duran to pure Britrock acts like Oasis, Supergrass and Blur, and classic acts like The Beatles.Tsar is the best band you've never heard of!RecommendedA

Move aside Westlife, Justin Timberlake, and Backstreet Boys.The greatest boy band of our time Take That have returned with a big bang.Beautiful World is That's 4th studio recorded album, not counting the compilations. It's a nice collection of mellowed-down ballads along with some foot-stompers and crowd-pleasers.The Manchester boys have grown up. It's been 10 years since the time Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, and Jason Orange announced that they were parting ways -Robbie Williams ditched the band months earlier and ended up being the most successful of them all, he does not return to the lineup this time around (it's his loss really). The overall feel and sound of World reflects the boys' maturity and self assurance. It also symbolizes the first time the boys share songwriting duties: Gary Barlow isn't the sole writer, Mark, Howard, and Jason all are credited; Jason debuts as a lead singer on the fantastic album closer Wooden Boat.The album opens up with the breathtaking Reach Out, a beautiful ballad and future single, that reminds us why we loved Take That in the first place. The UK Number 1 singles Patience and Shine are simply awesome, the latter written and sung with conviction by Mark is probably one of the best pop songs I've heard in a long time, while the former is sung by Gary with such an infectious passion; Patience is technically Gary's first hit single in about a decade. Mark's Shine is the most upbeat song on the album with a beat that is similar to ELO's Mr. Blue Sky, with Beatlesque harmonies and an incredible chorus; the music video to Shine includes references to The Beatles' Your Mother Should Know video. Howard's radio friendly self-reflective Mancunian Way, a potential single, is a cool song that will eventually grow on you after a couple of listens, while the feel-good title track, Beautiful World, features one of the best harmonies the boys have ever produced. Gary's lovely ballads Ain't No Sense In Love, another potential single, Like I Never Loved You At All, and the first group effort I'd Wait For Life produce a nostalgic sense of how great it was being a fan of Take That in the 90's. Mark's What You Believe In is an elusive bluesy pop-rock number. Finally, Jason Orange's breakthrough Wooden Boat is a country influenced acoustic number (Jason actually has learned to play guitar and write songs over the 10 years that passed), and turns out to be one of the highlights on World. There's also a bonus track that appears shorty after Boat fades out titled Butterfly, a sweet catchy ballad written by Gary.Beautiful World might not be as great as Everything Changes or Nobody Else, and Take That might not be as young and exciting as they were once. The album does lack the typical Take That dance and upbeat tracks along with the piano-driven ballads that made past efforts much more balanced. However, their return with this album deserves a very warm welcome. I'm sure the fans will agree!So I will end by saying: Take That, welcome back...and hopefully, for good this time!Track Picks:Reach OutPatienceBeautiful WorldShineMancunian WayAin't No Sense In LoveWooden Boat/ButterflyRecommendedB+

Move aside Westlife, Justin Timberlake, and Backstreet Boys.The greatest boy band of our time Take That have returned with a big bang.Beautiful World is That's 4th studio recorded album, not counting the compilations. It's a nice collection of mellowed-down ballads along with some foot-stompers and crowd-pleasers.The Manchester boys have grown up. It's been 10 years since the time Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, and Jason Orange announced that they were parting ways -Robbie Williams ditched the band months earlier and ended up being the most successful of them all, he does not return to the lineup this time around (it's his loss really). The overall feel and sound of World reflects the boys' maturity and self assurance. It also symbolizes the first time the boys share songwriting duties: Gary Barlow isn't the sole writer, Mark, Howard, and Jason all are credited; Jason debuts as a lead singer on the fantastic album closer Wooden Boat.The album opens up with the breathtaking Reach Out, a beautiful ballad and future single, that reminds us why we loved Take That in the first place. The UK Number 1 singles Patience and Shine are simply awesome, the latter written and sung with conviction by Mark is probably one of the best pop songs I've heard in a long time, while the former is sung by Gary with such an infectious passion; Patience is technically Gary's first hit single in about a decade. Mark's Shine is the most upbeat song on the album with a beat that is similar to ELO's Mr. Blue Sky, with Beatlesque harmonies and an incredible chorus; the music video to Shine includes references to The Beatles' Your Mother Should Know video. Howard's radio friendly self-reflective Mancunian Way, a potential single, is a cool song that will eventually grow on you after a couple of listens.

Oasis is the most significant rock band in Britain since The Rolling Stones. Their concerts still sell out within hours or days, they still make music, and they've replaced more band members than the Stones themselves.On 2002's Heathen Chemistry, their renovated band consisted of four songwriters (Noel was the only songwriter of the band before Liam discovered his talent, and Gem and Andy joined). Each member excluding drummer Alan White contributes to the album making Heathen Chemistry a group effort just like, dare I say, The Beatles.Noel has six tracks to his name this time around, but most of them just don't make a good lasting impression: the first single and a UK number one hit, the oddly titled The Hindu Times, sounds like a reminiscence of past smashing tunes like Roll With It and Supersonic with the use of layers of guitars and lyrics that include the words 'sunshine' and 'rain'. However Times lacks the energy and the charisma that would make this song stick for a long time. Force Of Nature is a Dylan-esque foot stomping tune, which Noel has been sounding a lot like lately. Force would have sounded better as a b-side instead of a second, or any, track on the album. She Is Love and Little By Little are both attempts to grasp old glory, with the latter sounding like an excellent American radio-friendly tune but oddly not released in America. Probably All In The Mind is a song I can easily say that's the least attractive number on the album. Stop Crying Your Heart Out is by far one of the best songs Noel has written in a long time, a heart wrenching sing along tune.Liam on the other hand contributes what has turned out to be the highlights on the album: the old fashioned rocker Better Man, the dark haunting ode to his son Lennon, Born On A Different Cloud, in which Liam mysteriously sounds exactly like John Lennon, and the deliciously good ballad Songbird, which is one of the best love songs Oasis has ever made.Andy Bell, previously in the bands Ride and Hurricane #1 where he was one of the main songwriters, only offers a short instrumental piece called A Quick Peep, which would have been better off off the album (Andy would go on to write excellent tunes on the follow up Don't Believe The Truth). While Gem Archer offers the most Oasis sounding track Hung In A Bad Place, a song that has the same foot stomping affect that past hits like Roll With It had, but just not as memorable and falls in the same trap as The Hindu Times.Heathen Chemistry is applaudable simply for the fact that the entire group pitched in. You can sense the coordination between Liam, Noel, Andy and Gem throughout the album. Ironically, Heathen Chemistry would be Alan White's last with Oasis; he would be replaced later on with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey.Is it worth the aggravation?Yes, if you're looking into appreciating Don't Believe The Truth, and most definitely if you are an Oasis fan.Heathen Chemistry is not Oasis's strongest effort since Morning Glory as some might say, but neither is it their weakest.Track picks:Stop Crying Your Heart OutSongbirdLittle By LittleBorn On A Different CloudBetter ManRecommendedB-

Once John William's extraordinary score comes blasting out with the title Superman Returns popping up on the screen, and the credits flying across the screen (a nod to the original Superman film), I felt like jumping and cheering. Unfortunately, that was to be the most excitement I would get throughout the 150 minutes I spent watching the most disappointing sequel of the year so far.You can't help but watch Superman Returns and think about Christopher Reeve, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marc Maclure, and Marlon Brando (the only actor from the original that we actually see and hear in Returns). The reason why you can't stop thinking about those actors and hope you can see them onscreen instead of the actual actors who are in the film is because none of the actual stars, excluding Brandon Routh, convinces you that they are Perry White, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Jimmy Olsen.Kate Bosworth is just too young (merely 23 years of age) and not vibrant enough to play Lois. Besides, there is no chemistry between her and Routh, who plays Clark Kent and Superman pretty swell! Kal Penn, who played Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, plays one of Luthor's thugs, but his character doesn't speak throughout the film (what a waste of comedic talent), the kid who plays Jimmy Olsen is not funny, and annoys you everytime he appears onscreen. Finally, there's Frank Langella (the man who played Skeletor opposite Dolph Lundgren's He-Man in Masters Of The Universe) who doesn't have the natural charm that Cooper brought to the Perry White character.Now let's talk about the script: horrendous. The plot and the plot twists are just one big mess aside from some unnecessary special effects and action sequences (the airplane crashing scene where Lois tumbles from one end of the airplane to another), and Clark Kent drinking beer (didn't Superman confess that he never drinks nor lies in his interview with Lois Lane in the original film? It seems Supe is a liar after all!). Warner seems to have rushed through pre-production picking one of the worse drafts of the scripts for production, but why? I'm not going to go into the details, but what were they thinking with the last 30 minutes of the film? Have they lost their minds? This is a Superman movie...not a Lois Lane movie (I hope those of you who saw it understand what I mean?).The only two good things about the movie are Brandon Routh and the opening credits and musical score. With that aside, Superman Returns flies flat on its face!Not recommended unless you're a gigantic Superman fanatic.D
